he has been the first in the world to apply machine learning to develop

39
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.530 
a self improving teaching system.

40
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.010

he is also a fellow of the international society for learning sizes.

49
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.260 
so with these three impressive

50
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.380 
speakers, let me give a brief presentation with some ideas in order to

51
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.040 
give a direction to the spanish system.

52
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.990 
in the previous presentation of jeff mason kind of coursera

53
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.430 
he mentioned in the cuny part that

54
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.340 
he's seeing many interesting mixing of content gnosis.

55
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.640 
some people are taking pasado other digital content and mixing in hybrid dazing it

56
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.260 
with face to face person

57
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.860 
teaching or with person assessment etcetera. so we are seeing

58
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.050 
i think and we will see even more in the future many ways of

59
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.430 
mixing face to face and online.

60
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.730 
maybe we don't we are not very clear what it means, so we have different

61
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.410 
understandings now and the different words that probably mean

62
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.010 
different things to all of us blended hybrid mix mode by model

63
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.400 
delivery or recently i've also heard by chronos as a term that

64
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.600 
combines synchronous and asynchronous.

65
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.560 
whatever the term this mixing of modalities i think will be

66
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.180 
something we will see more in the future.

67
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.580 
but what do we mean by hybrid, do we mean

68
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:03.950 
such a division of tradition versus open university that gave with

69
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.650 
seen since the last forty fifty years

70
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.440 
that is universities are totally face to face in the open all

71
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.080 
universities are only online, is this the way to divide?

72
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.420 
or is it more blended where in the same course you have digital elements

73
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.520 
and face to face elements or even further,

74
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.470 
doing something with some people called liquid education with

75
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.920 
the blue and the red the blue were supposed to be the on-site

76
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.190 
and the red was supposed to be the online is mixed in very

77
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.240 
interesting ways.

78
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.440 
i like to cite philip been of the

79
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.060 
application who talks about the dg vacation of the world and

80
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.900 
i like to talk about the dg education of education.

81
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.280 
in the same way as we have

82
00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.870 
face to face a concert and we have recorded a music

83
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.000 
the dg combines the recorded the digital maybe with

84
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.840 
that emotions of the moment and combining in very interesting

85
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.770 
ways. so it combines in a life way recorded things to make a new experience.

86
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.980 
and i think this is a good metaphor to understand some of the

87
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.560 
ways in which we can combine online and offline.

88
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.350 
in their many ways let me just mention another

89
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.270 
one that is this app called and puzzle where you can remix

90
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.390 
videos. you can take videos from youtube or from an academy or from

91
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.320 
many other places and insert and make it your own and insert

92
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.680 
quizzes questions moments of reflection. so this combination

93
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.570 
of material which is online which is digital with your own

94
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.990 
elements which you can combine in many different ways i think will come prevalent

95
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.590 
in the coming years.

96
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.940 
also simple example i like to imagine that the tik tok duets where

97
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.430 
somebody takes a video from somebody else and makes a new video

98
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.430 
adding new stuff and making a new combination in his way each

99
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.380 
dancing or singing or on arm with it.

100
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.470 
and even you don't know where we are life right now.
maybe this was recorded,

101
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.430 
who knows we'll see maybe we'll come back with the same clothes

102
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.020 
and the communications and this has been recorded before.

103
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.930 
so this is an introduction let me ask the three panelists to

104
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.760 
reflect on their views of the future of the high university.

105
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.630 
and what kind of hybrid what is the road map and how to get there?

106
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.830 
what structures need to change in the present at university?

107
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.830 
do the traditional universities have to take over some of the structures

108
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.710 
of open universitie?

109
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.730 
what is they will university lose the leadership in higher education monopoly.

110
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:08.190 
and what about lifelong learning how does it enter into university.

111
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.410 
ok so with this brief interaction. i'd like to give the floor

112
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.120 
now to sir john daniel to him to give his thoughts.
thank you very much.

113
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.310 
thank you Carlos.

114
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.960 
you just get my slides up.

115
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.190 
it's a great pleasure to join the three of you and thank you

116
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.010 
for that very appropriate introduction carless.

117
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.680 
it's a delight to be with these other two colleagues,

118
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:53.280 
because we spend three continents and three different higher education traditions.

119
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.550 
at pierre is at an elite selective institution where the term

120
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.370 
open in open and distance learning doesn't mean much.

121
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.810 
i'm from the distance education scale tradition where you're

122
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.430 
not really open if you have less than one hundred thousand students.

123
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.980 
and peter has experience of both open university's and campus teaching.

124
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.970 
our topic is the hybridization of the university.

125
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:29.740 
and i will simply ask ask the question.

126
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.310 
hybrid of walt because the first point is that we won't know

127
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.590 
until the end of two thousand and twenty two and perhaps not，

128
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.710 
then if we are really moving towards hybrid universities.

129
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.270 
two canadian colleagues that i respect have opposite views

130
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.680 
on how universities will teach after covid-19.

131
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:01.790 
alex asher of higher education strategy associates in Toronto

132
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:07.630 
says canadian higher education institutions will likely look ridiculous,

133
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.790 
if they do anything other than a near complete return to in-person

134
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.900 
teaching for the fall the vast majority of students seventy

135
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.790 
to eighty percent or so are simply desperate to be back on campus,

136
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:28.120 
to be back with friends, to be in classes they will be simply and rightly furious,

137
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.230 
if we force them into another term of remote learning.

138
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.220 
now tony bates is well known to many of you.
he opened up research

139
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:44.050 
into the student use of media at the uk open
university back in nineteen seventy.

140
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:49.650 
and since the publication, the e publication of his masterwork

141
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.640 
teaching in a digital age.
i think he can claim to be the leading

142
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.470 
guru of e-learning.

143
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.080 
john we don't see your slides

144
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.350 
where you look i'll continue.

145
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.760 
and the slides are very simple and

146
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.210 
that's very helpful. thank you.

147
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.330 
yes, that's good and in fact can i change that okay.

148
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.690 
so anyway tony banks in a recent blog said

149
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.530 
the growth in both fully online and blended hybrid learning

150
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.420 
is bound to accelerate and both institutions
and instructors had better prepare.

151
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:39.480 
so who is right? i suspect both predictions
are probably correct partly.

152
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.870 
two of my grandchildren are undergraduates in montreal and

153
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.440 
after a year of remote teaching and lockdowns.
they are very eager to get

154
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.650 
back to campus and classrooms.

155
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.500 
tony bates has followed the development of e-learning in canada

156
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.100 
where the growth of registrations for online courses

157
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.460 
has outpaced those of on-campus courses for some years.

158
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:10.350 
and covered nineteen has made teachers
and students familiar with working online.

159
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.170 
so the growth of online enrolments will probably accelerate.

160
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.820 
particularly for graduate students and upper year undergraduates.

161
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:25.740 
so universities will likely adopt
various hybrids of online and classroom teaching.

162
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.620 
the key issue for me is what are the elements of the hybrid.

163
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.120 
what is being hybridized?

164
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.880 
callest in this helpful slide to stop and our focus,

165
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.660 
because it presents the future as a blend of
traditional university and open university.

166
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:50.070 
now we know what we mean by traditional university.
but what about open university?

167
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.680 
my second point then is that the purposes
and methods of open universities

168
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.230 
will not hybridize well with campus universities.

169
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:09.410 
so let me explain next slide covid-19 has accelerated a bifurcation

170
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.330 
of distance education.

171
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:17.640 
before covd19 distance education developed in three

172
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.040 
phases if you could move on the slide please carless.

173
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.620 
broadly we had a century of

174
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.660 
correspondence education mostly commercially run,

175
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.480 
and then in nineteen seventy,

176
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.940 
a open university brought three revolutionary
novelties to our education.

177
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:50.350 
it used modern communication technologies.
it abolished academic prerequisites for entry

178
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.410 
and it operated at scale.

179
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:58.860 
the term multimedia distance education was coined.

180
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.470 
and today there are fifty open universities around world.

181
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:10.450 
the years open and distance learning had little impact
on campus universities.

182
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:15.210 
but since two thousand the internet has spread around the world

183
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.650 
and teachers have used it to put courses online.

184
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:25.740 
tony bates called this the lone ranger approach to course development,

185
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.100 
but it is very different from the way the open universities do it.

186
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:36.160 
the irish scholar desmond keegan put this well,
when he said that

187
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:42.380 
in classroom education the teachers are teachers
whereas in distance education

188
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.540 
the institution teachers.

189
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:51.380 
back in the eighteenth century the economist
and moral philosopher adam smith

190
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.520 
drew attention to the very different ways that cottage workshops

191
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.410 
and industrial factories operated.

192
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:05.490 
and classroom teaching and distance learning
are the educational equivalents

193
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.130 
of this dichotomy.

194
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:14.980 
future challenges will conduct will require
us to conduct distance learning

195
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.950 
in two very different ways. and that's my third point.

196
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.280 
first we will need distance learning at scale

197
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:30.010 
enrolling millions of learners to meet
the huge ambitions for education and training

198
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.450 
in the UN sustainable development goals.

199
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.280 
second we must also improve the quality and attractiveness

200
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.770 
of hybrid remote teaching

201
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.840 
that will be part of the future for some campuses.

202
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:50.460 
a simple model of distance learning helps
us to highlight the different requirements.

203
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.180 
think of distance learning as a stool with three legs,

204
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:03.050 
which are learning materials administration
and logistics and student support.

205
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.010 
and this tool is a good analogy,
because unless all three legs are strong.

206
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.000 
the stool will collapse and the student may fall.

207
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:21.660 
so how do we look make the legs strong. let us
look first at three successful examples

208
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.270 
of distance learning at scale. next slide please.

209
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:33.940 
the uk open university is the icon for effective operation at scale

210
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.690 
in higher education.
it has close to two hundred thousand students

211
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.520 
served by a relatively small full time staff

212
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:50.420 
millions of extra students will seek higher
education in the next thirty years.

213
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.570 
and open universities are part of the answer.

214
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.900 
but there are huge needs at the school level too.

215
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.340 
some two hundred million of
the world's teenagers are not getting secondary schooling.

216
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.810 
and open schools are part of the answer.

217
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.670 
the world leader here is india's national institute for open schooling

218
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.500 
which reaches two million students with a central staff of

219
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.720 
only two hundred and fifty and some three thousand study centres.

220
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.960 
and finally for continuing education we now have Mooc as carlos

221
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.610 
mentioned at the beginning.
and i take the example of future learn

222
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.980 
where i've taken twenty courses myself.

223
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.970 
future learn teaches twelve million users with a central staff

224
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.410 
of a hundred and thirty and partnerships with over two hundred

225
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.960 
and fifty other institutions for
course development and student support.

226
00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:01.290 
these are three example of the use of
industrial methods and networks of partnerships

227
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.950 
to achieve scale quality and reach.

228
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:11.940 
they answer the aspirations expressed
in the slogan that launched the open university,

229
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:19.540 
open to people, open to places, open to methods, and open to ideas.

230
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:25.910 
but trying to hybridized campus universities
with these large scale operations

231
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.750 
will not work. their purposes are different.

232
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.430 
campuses want to offer some distance learning.

233
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.570 
but they are not making access their mission.

234
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:42.820 
they are not seeking to be open and offer distance learning

235
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:47.730 
to thousands of students. and their methods are distinct to.

236
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:54.450 
i go back to my three legged stool.
my three examples of large scale distance education.

237
00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:00.270 
carry out the functions of producing
course materials supporting students

238
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.040 
and providing efficient administration in different ways.

239
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.250 
but none of these can easily be grafted onto campus teaching.

240
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.760 
so how can campus universities

241
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:20.740 
benefit from the successes of distance
education by doing hybrid teaching well.

242
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.140 
let's take the three legs of the stool one by one starting

243
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.330 
with administration and logistics.

244
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:33.520 
cottage industry methods of teaching
are part of the attraction of campus study.

245
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.360 
it's unwise to adopt industrial approaches.

246
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.070 
but the lone ranger cannot do it alone.
and if the system is

247
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.480 
to work for students, the administration must get involved.

248
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.540 
the teacher will teach.

249
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.300 
but with more guidance and organization from the institution.

250
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.920 
how can the hybrid university create learning materials that

251
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.770 
match the quality of those produced
by open university and MOOCs called developments?

252
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.240 
the answer is to fish in the well stocked pool

253
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.210 
of open educational resources.

254
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.840 
we draw on colleagues' work when we do research,

255
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.140 
so why not do the same for teaching?

256
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.660 
as well as open educational resources

257
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.330 
students can be directed to moocs which are mostly still free

258
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.670 
and have high quality components.

259
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.190 
finally what are the elements of student support that large

260
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:42.570 
scale distance education campuses
that the campuses expanding online learning

261
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.820 
could draft into their system.

262
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.180 
the key principle is that effective support from real human beings

263
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.090 
is vital for the success of most remote students.

264
00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.180 
the planners of the uk open university learned this, when they

265
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.160 
examined the australian experience in the nineteen sixties.

266
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:12.140 
and that led them to create an extensive
tutorial network numbering five thousand students' tutors today.

267
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:18.440 
over my eleven years as vice chancellor of the uk.

268
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:25.230 
i spoke individually to some fifty thousand
students as they collected their degrees.

269
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.460 
thousands of them told me with some emotion

270
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:33.030 
that their tutors were the key to their perseverance and success.

271
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:39.410 
campus universities tend to take
the availability of student support for granted.

272
00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.820 
but for remote students it has to be organised.

273
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.470 
and the reason that my present institution
the extended school of management

274
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:53.740 
saw increases in student retention and performance during the pandemic，

275
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:59.160 
was because we took every opportunity and used every mechanism available

276
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.660 
to stay in touch with the students.

277
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.300 
so my conclusion is that you cannot create a hybrid of a traditional

278
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.380 
university and an open university what you can and should do

279
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:18.790 
is to take some of the secrets of success of the large scale
distance learning providers,

280
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:25.310 
and incorporate them into your plans to expand remote learning after the pandemic.

281
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.740 
and i wish you well in that endeavour,thank you.

282
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.190 
thank you very much john.

283
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.390 
let's move to the next speaker, and then we'll go to the session

284
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.890 
with all of you and with.

285
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.720 
so peter is your thank you.

286
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.360 
that is really great and a fantastic.

287
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.470 
summary of who we all are i think john

288
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.930 
one of the things. i'd say is that absolutely.

289
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.490 
the university that i currently work in

290
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:05.170 
is one of those universities that has a very clear mission.

291
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.370 
most universities try to work on a mission.

292
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.580 
that's that fits to their needs and be able to talk about his minutae.

293
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:16.380 
so you ts is the city university in the metro heart of sydney.

294
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:21.130 
the entrepreneurial beating heart connected to industry looking at

295
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.950 
serving a

296
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:30.720 
community of learners who want to reach into
the world of work in metro sydney.

297
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.230 
we don't reach very much further beyond those bounds.

298
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.840 
and i think the idea that that will be a hybrid

299
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.690 
is actually an interesting one, because the idea of the hybrid

300
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.510 
being a bad thing is an interesting challenge.

301
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.620 
i think for for some of us

302
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.790 
the that the hybrid is also a good thing.

303
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.500 
if you compare if the hybrid universe was a car,

304
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:02.560 
then you might say well they are the gas-guzzling
university the inefficient university,

305
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.090 
universities that are probably quite bad for the world

306
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.820 
can be supplemented by the ideas you've talked about.
i think john

307
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.060 
and expand their mission grow significantly.

308
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.290 
but one of the things.
i'd say is that from a universe when

309
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.990 
you think about a university perspective.
we tend to think about

310
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:27.420 
hybrid being about materials hybrid being about a mix of things

311
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.210 
that you know even the best interpretation will be a change

312
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.900 
to the student experience to engage with materials

313
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.470 
and people. but for most universities hybrid is also a range

314
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.120 
of things that make a business model work that actually how

315
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.410 
to run the university and make it effective.

316
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.660 
they're also about changing the nature of
the university's relationship to work.

317
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.030 
there's also hybrid activities reaching out into making sure that we're

318
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:58.550 
teaching and learning in a world black.
and it's focused around skills as well.

319
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.610 
so one thing that i'll say in  my part of
the presentation actually is that

320
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.310 
hybrid isn't really about any of those things for me.

321
00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:12.050 
for me hybrid speaks to learners choice,

322
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.150 
it's about giving the opportunity to decide what is how they best learn,

323
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.880 
how they best move themselves through the lifetime journey,

324
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:28.040 
where i think for us in the academy hybrid will mean

325
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.680 
a significant change to how we work.

326
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.210 
because of all of those other things hybrid means a new way

327
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.220 
of working for the twenty first century of academic，if we are

328
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:44.950 
not to give it back. very quickly note that when we look at university

329
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.760 
strategies a year on year on year, and this is an analysis in australia

330
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.350 
from twenty eighteen.

331
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.860 
there are forty universities in australia and if you take forty

332
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.540 
university strategies and compare them all.
they're really very similar.

333
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.040 
most universities are focused on growing
lifelong connecting to the community

334
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.950 
doing all the the similar sorts of things that are very important

335
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.960 
in making sure that we change the world through social justice,

336
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.020 
but use our common set of techniques to to do that.

337
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.780 
if you start to think about that analysis,
then as something that is

338
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.190 
a question about what we do next what strategy looked like

339
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.090 
as of last year, we did a quick analysis of those fourteen

340
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.440 
again noting that again social justice justice agenda.

341
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.710 
most australian universities are deeply concerned about the skills gap.

342
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.320 
and trying to look very hard at matching what they teach the

343
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.260 
skills gap and in particular work integrated learning getting

344
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.250 
student much more integrated into the world of work internships
and so on.

345
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.790 
the almost world universities care about the lifelong learning agenda.

346
00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.560 
and particularly in areas like postgraduate where you're reaching out

347
00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.020 
in the direction towards the world of work rather than back into school.

348
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.680 
and for many particularly research-intensive
universities being university

349
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:17.110 
is being a scholar and a researcher and taking that research

350
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.020 
explanation research translation and explanation to the world.

351
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.530 
so the research nexus is really very very important.

352
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.950 
when you actually look at them what

353
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.190 
most analysts thing university will do,

354
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.330 
as we think about whether universities will pivot back to traditional

355
00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:42.720 
methods or take on some of those hybrid changes
that john was talking about.

356
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.810 
most of the analysts see the campus changing becoming

357
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.370 
a bit more porous, a bit more connected to the world of work

358
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.550 
more automation's rather fewer people actually being on the

359
00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.040 
campuses they don't want to come. in US i would note that

360
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.440 
postgraduate learners have noted that some of our pivot to

361
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.990 
online is pretty good.
and they know that keen to return to classroom experiences

362
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.810 
they are keen to see how that choice can be delivered for the

363
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:12.920 
high quality.

364
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.230 
and many analysts are noting that the students are also changing.

365
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.360 
it's not just the universities changing,

366
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.650 
students are now being significantly more demanding of university,

367
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.710 
because they've seen what quality could be

368
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.010 
in an online experience.

369
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.610 
a real question for me is whether there is a real before code

370
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.960 
in an after code factor or whether universities will simply pivot back

371
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.230 
to the existing way of being servicing the specific mission

372
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.940 
to a specific community or whether we're going to be taking

373
00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.340 
on some of those new things that john has been talking about.

374
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.870 
and i can see some critical things if the academy changes that

375
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.410 
we could be doing very differently.

376
00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.850 
i think many universities won't be doing examining in the traditional way,

377
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.210 
will be examining different utps won't be going back

378
00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:04.170 
to conventional exams.

379
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.860 
and we will be working with partners like
some of the commercial partners

380
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.710 
in very different ways.

381
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.860 
right answered my audios bad let me just explain

382
00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.760 
a little bit about what UTS has been doing

383
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.310 
rather than investing nukes and working in partnership we've

384
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.510 
been building our own channels to take short forms of learning

385
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.520 
to develop new pathways into learning. so our channel is UTS

386
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.480 
open trying to open and disrupt ourselves by creating a lot

387
00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.860 
more micro potential pathways into learning.

388
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.960 
we have something like two hundred short forms of learning

389
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.740 
a hundred hundred micro potentials and all of those are distributed

390
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.520 
across a lifetime of learning journey creating new pathways

391
00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.410 
for learners deliberately and designed into be new pathways

392
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.290 
into parts of that journey with us towards credit.

393
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.240 
i think lots of universities will be doing that now and the

394
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.990 
most exciting thing we can be working on together is genuinely

395
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.460 
trading and working together.

396
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.920 
as institutions that can say why not spend some time at a pfl

397
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.570 
if you want to. some time at gts if you want to and some time

398
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:20.610 
as an open university if you want to and build your own passport your own

399
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.250 
own learning experience.

400
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.950 
i'll finish by saying that actually really really the major

401
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:33.020 
disruption is to the academy. as academics we have to act differently.

402
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.040 
we have to develop new ways of working and some countries are

403
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.140 
doing this pretty well. so in holland for example

404
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.880 
the netherlands universities are looking very carefully at

405
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.450 
how to try and describe the new work that the academy needs to be doing

406
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.760 
and capture that in new practices.

407
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.240 
that for me is the critical change for hybrid.

408
00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.230 
thanks very much peter.

409
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.060 
let's move over to pierre please.

410
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.850 
thank you carlos i was just changing my slight last minute as always.

411
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:17.770 
oh thank you peter and john you are right john.

412
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.380 
our university is a different animal.

413
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.950 
nine thousand students

414
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.980 
very selective top fifteen in many rankings.

415
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.520 
and big differences peter or students do not pay much

416
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:39.390 
to enter in this university.
the cost of registration is very very

417
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.740 
is less than one percent of the budget of the pfl.
we are basically the chance

418
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.400 
as many european university to be a publicly funded university.

419
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.150 
so it's a different animal and we have a big problem.

420
00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.340 
look at your campus. it's too beautiful.

421
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.440 
with a nice campus.
we cannot even argue about online education

422
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.300 
when people you know.
it's just a nice campus we ski in the morning.

423
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.960 
we sail in the afternoon. we have great wine in the

424
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.120 
evening that's life in luzon and.

425
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:15.150 
so nonetheless we went through a lot to disagree with you.

426
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.170 
we went massively into moocs in two thousand and twelve hours

427
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.540 
and fortunate to have my sabbatical in the same street as coursera.

428
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:26.550 
so i had no sabbatical and so today we have three million registration.

429
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.440 
we all know what it means registration. it's a bit of a

430
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.840 
related things, but we have continued to have no today a one

431
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.340 
hundred thirty moocs. some of them on coursera some of them on a dicks

432
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.790 
and some of them own on the local instance of ethics.

433
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.780 
so we've been continuing this way and
that was very useful because when the enemy came

434
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.690 
on a friday morning we said it will be online on monday.

435
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:50.740 
and on monday it was ready.

436
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.630 
the teams had been walking our training teachers
on over the saturday into sunday.

437
00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.030 
it was so we had this kind of a advantage when the pandemic

438
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.850 
came to be ready. but it was not of course the goal of being online.

439
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.090 
by the way i just mentioned that because we organised the first

440
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.170 
two imag event in thirteen and fourteen.
so i thought it would

441
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.100 
be nice to say a few words about where we are rested in two

442
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.760 
months we have not abandoned enough even.
if we have not been

443
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.640 
less active in the community we are so after the

444
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.140 
hosting of open indexed

445
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.390 
universities that cannot afford the university of applied science

446
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.840 
that don't have the same support so what about the lessons

447
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.020 
learned during the pandemic. if i can summarize it like that

448
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.150 
if you are students online lecture that was ok.

449
00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.300 
i mean they don't like it too much but some of them say actually.

450
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.360 
i prefer online lecture and face to face

451
00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.210 
exercise addition the recitation section where you walk with some tea

452
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.840 
that is there to help you that was more difficult to orchestrate.

453
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.840 
there were some advantages.

454
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.510 
but like everyone in my class two hundred students, the students

455
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.460 
would come and say how can i have a steer that speaks french?

456
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.720 
and you can do it when you arrive in a zoom room
that coordinates things.

457
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.370 
you cannot do it in intellectual of course all
the labs the practical stuff was very difficult,

458
00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.460 
but to divide classes by three and the real

459
00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.550 
pain point was social life,

460
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.820 
life on campus what you expect. so the lecturing was not the

461
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.450 
worst part except one thing,

462
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.460 
we tried doing when the pandemic was a bit better we tried

463
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.620 
to vibrate lecture. so one certain campus two third online one

464
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.290 
third in the room you're lecturing to them. but at the same

465
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.240 
time you have two third in newsroom that was really

466
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.060 
almost impossible experience. orchestrating a class where

467
00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.920 
you have question and chat that you cannot read and

468
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.700 
question in the class and so on.
that was something that will probably not continue.

469
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.760 
we had a massive increase we moved from one

470
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:58.050 
or two flipped classes to two twenty flipped classes or more,

471
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.560 
so that was a real positive lessons.

472
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.370 
so i don't know about you we did not talk about exams,

473
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:10.220 
but you know place exams our apart keep out of his things we refuse

474
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.570 
all online proffering solution. i have been talking to

475
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.230 
sales people from the online brokering

476
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.800 
been bumping me, but either

477
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.520 
whatever solution you can always say you know whatever control

478
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.210 
to do you cannot say oh sorry i lost wi-fi for one minute and

479
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.780 
read in minute you call your friend and you are back.

480
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.220 
and so currently we the only way to avoid cheating online is the

481
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.980 
intelligence of the question. the quality of the question so

482
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.050 
that any students with

483
00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.650 
different solutions. where so set up the teacher had dessert.

484
00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.110 
for during the exam that was very much appreciated.

485
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.810 
so the question today is how can we keep the momentum how can we keep

486
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.170 
on most teachers say well finally, it was not so bad finally.

487
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.770 
i had more interaction than with my students and in a standard lecture room.

488
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.550 
so they're kind of negative everyone
everybody wants to be back on campus no discussion.

489
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.710 
but they say can we keep the positive aspect.

490
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:16.540 
so more participation in some classes
more access to exercise and so on.

491
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:21.520 
so i try to work on that know that what are we going to present tomorrow

492
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.250 
to my the head of all curricula is this study.

493
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:30.510 
don't in australia this meta-analysis where they collected

494
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.880 
a thousand papers they selected one hundred
empirical studies that compare

495
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.550 
learning with videos versus lectures.

496
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:45.190 
and dvd's a the effect size when you do a meta-analysis.

497
00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:50.890 
the effect size is one third of a standard deviation.
so it's not massive.

498
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:54.880 
it's bigger if you compare video to text of course,

499
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.530 
but smaller if you compare video to lecture of course.

500
00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.750 
if you compare video to lecture,
there is not a a big difference. there is more

501
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:09.480 
effect size if you work on skills.
but we are not going to replace lecture

502
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:13.880 
by videos at the befell what i am striving for result teachers

503
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.290 
is to convince them. you know you have this zero point eight standard

504
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.270 
deviation deviation gain.

505
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.110 
if you use video as a complement to lecture mister.

506
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.890 
it is just common sense they have an extra resource that they can

507
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.350 
jump on it when they have not understood something.

508
00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.560 
so that's what i am trying to convince know all teachers.

509
00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.030 
the second thing we are working on is exchanging courses partners.

510
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:45.010 
we are different initiatives, we still delved
in the past not so successful.

511
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.880 
in principle everybody said yeah we agree.
but then you have

512
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.760 
a lot of problems like and what if it is a day day off in delft.

513
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:57.110 
and not a day off in lausanne and what if the teacher and what

514
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.080 
if you have retaken there. if there is no retaken roads under

515
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.880 
a lot of difficulties. but nowhere to train again with no tech

516
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.810 
which is to mencken to denmark to indo vinh

517
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.680 
as to

518
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.340 
any good technique paris

519
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.410 
to a man a curriculum to see what is needed in the

520
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.340 
maybe in the master in

521
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.190 
the with one class that the section that the teachers really

522
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.510 
need. and we don't need the expert can we borrow it from another
institution.

523
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.490 
so this networking is difficult.
it's easy to say well,

524
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.680 
we've discussed that in e-moocs for many years.

525
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.460 
but now the times is changing. i hope we will

526
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.460 
if my success so and to finish one thing that does change and

527
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.970 
that will continue to change is the idea of a hybrid

528
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.740 
knowledge space to bring together in the same knowledge space.

529
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.720 
the scientific publication the educational material and everything.

530
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.570 
so this is something we have achieved known at the pfl,

531
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.640 
if you go to graph search
and you type for instance sustainable development you have.

532
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.990 
the wikipedia definition all the classes that teach the concept,

533
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:14.410 
all the people which are involved in this concept all the publication.

534
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:18.410 
you only see a subset. if you see look at all the classes teach

535
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.900 
something about sustainable development more than one hundred,

536
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.620 
and you look at the last one information security,

537
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:28.270 
you would say well what we did not about

538
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.990 
sustainable development. so let's search about sustainable development

539
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.840 
and you find a slide where the words sustainable development do not appear,

540
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.980 
because we use fuzzy logic to find information is not a simple he word searching.

541
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.980 
and if you click on watch it you arrive directly in the zoom

542
00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.090 
recording where the professor is speaking about the concept that you are

543
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:55.730 
looking for. so it's kind of eating merged together what is ivory there

544
00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.240 
is the all the online material of education and research.

545
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.990 
maybe you don't know exactly what you are looking for

546
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.470 
due to a query so maybe you want to navigate.
so if you type global warming.

547
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.110 
then you have in blue all the courses about global warming on a compass.

548
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:17.490 
in yellow all the concepts connected to global warming,

549
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.240 
you have this kind of sixties visualisation that actually

550
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.760 
doesn't help a lot. because there is too much information,

551
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.960 
you want to zoom a little bit,
then and to if more direct information.

552
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.880 
so let's go and look more closely about the

553
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:41.340 
a listers that compose this big map, i'm finishing twenty seconds.

554
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:47.890 
who he received for instance water quality water pollution is there.

555
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.940 
and you might want to have

556
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:55.470 
a closer look of what are the concept yellow.
i repeat and only courses

557
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.560 
that are connected to water pollution. though the hybrid space

558
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.080 
of the pfl is now a huge knowledge space, that is both in teaching

559
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.260 
and research and maybe that's another dimension of eib radiation

560
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.850 
that we have not been talking. this is my concept of water pollution.

561
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.780 
and a course in blue where with some teachers it is addressing this issue.

562
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:23.450 
i can look at the core three of this concept and so on and so on.

563
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.050 
so the idea is to have a campus that basically

564
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.850 
is neither online or offline, it's kind of a

565
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.910 
getting one campus that because there is this underlying

566
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.510 
knowledge base that covers both physical and online activities.

567
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.630 
that is coming carlos.

568
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.570 
thank you very much pierre. so let me ask one question to start

569
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:53.230 
off and then we'll have the audience us i will not ask which

570
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:57.540 
campuses period lozano sydney or vancouver, because i think

571
00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:02.530 
it's very difficult to respond to this question. but let me

572
00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:08.300 
start with something which john started off. and i've seen also in your presentations.

573
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.580 
is that traditional universities should take some of the structures

574
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:18.190 
of online universities. now and you presented the stool john

575
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:22.140 
with his three legs. and you talked about

576
00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:27.650 
student support maybe then

577
00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.620 
the difference between the teacher, teaches or the institution teaches,

578
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.630 
should the traditional university move towards more the institution teaches

579
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:42.480 
in the sense that it should provide more structures to help provide content,
provide

580
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.180 
engagement and to the traditional teacher that

581
00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:51.890 
is the teacher we have at the university is a lone ranger and

582
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:57.520 
should be more accompanied with structures that help him to provide more scaffolding

583
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.600 
teaching?

584
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.020 
let me comment first perhaps.
i think my focus there was particularly

585
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.700 
on the sort of organization of the university and the programs.

586
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.780 
what when people started getting into a tiny base called the lone ranger approach.

587
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.880 
it was essentially a free for all some profs did some courses online others didn't

588
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.260 
so the students took what they got. but once you decide that

589
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.450 
you want to make this a sort of significant part of the university's operation.

590
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:34.790 
someone has to lay down which courses when will they be offered,

591
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.440 
so that the students have some way of planning what they want, they can do.

592
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:43.850 
so i think the first area where the university becomes slightly

593
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:47.530 
intrusive, if you like on the professors complete independence

594
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:51.540 
is simply an time tabling and an organization. and I remember

595
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.320 
even in the nineteen eighties when i was president

596
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.820 
of a university northern ontario which had a significant distance learning arm

597
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.070 
that we had to organize that at the university level. so that when

598
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:08.810 
professors went on sabbatical. the course was continuing in some form.

599
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:14.070 
well beyond that i think is quite an interesting debate.

600
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.790 
the last point i would make there which brings us on to something else,

601
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.390 
when all the world's universities switch to online learning over a weekend,

602
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:29.660 
obviously the main focus was on doing live zoom lectures. and over the

603
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.410 
weeks and months some of them got very good at it particularly

604
00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:37.810 
the breakout sessions and how to make those work properly,
as time went on

605
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:41.580 
and this is something i strongly encouraged they began to realise

606
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.850 
that there was more to

607
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.320 
online learning than live online learning and that if you did a synchronous.

608
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:53.850 
a possibilities this enriched things and made it a better experience

609
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.850 
for the students and became very popular. so i think there again

610
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:03.390 
once you get to a significant asynchronous component.

611
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:08.880 
the institution has to get involved in some way to facilitate the obtention

612
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:13.710 
of materials from other providers and generally to see that

613
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:18.530 
the thing is not chaotic. but this obviously is a very touchy

614
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.630 
issue in universities where the tradition is for the professor

615
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:27.610 
to be pretty well completely autonomous in the teaching function.

616
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:35.280 
yes no the freedom of the teacher of within his topic to teach whatever

617
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.440 
they want peter what is just your take on it.

618
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.040 
now i see i think it's really critical.

619
00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.700 
that we help academics to change is one of the most essential

620
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:52.990 
things that we do. so for me the question is whether this is a marginal

621
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:56.460 
activity for universities or whether it's core.

622
00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.140 
i think what pierre is saying is that all of the stuff.

623
00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.350 
they're doing with moocs is great. but is marginal.

624
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.110 
it's not really affecting the core of what their business is.

625
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.210 
correct me if i'm wrong yeah yes.

626
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.270 
he's saying his absolutely call to openness that we have

627
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.280 
this completely different view of what learning and teaching is

628
00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.720 
one delta to what you said is that

629
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:31.920 
the one of the main role of moocs is to help

630
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.710 
us to learn to succeed the first year.

631
00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:37.780 
we're very selective first year we are not going to make it

632
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.690 
easy, but we want to be fair resistant. and so

633
00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:43.460 
the monks in some way are

634
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.740 
already paid by the swiss taxpayers, because they are

635
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:54.390 
designed for on courses, then we have a few extra MOOCs that

636
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:58.910 
are more in the outreach. but it's slightly different than we

637
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.780 
thought for these classes like calculus one one physics one one

638
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.210 
algebra, one one the it's not peripheral,

639
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:09.110 
it's central.

640
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:13.880 
the open aspect is peripheral. that's right.

641
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.290 
so i mean one of the interesting things. i would reflect at

642
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:21.360 
because phil long was asked a good question

643
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:29.490 
in the chat is that for some of us we are actually building new degree programs

644
00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:31.950 
that are designed to represent that flexibility.

645
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.600 
we are building degree programs where the students can put together curriculum

646
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.560 
to achieve their outcomes.

647
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:42.900 
and those are what are generally called stack programs and

648
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.240 
they're actually very common in open universities where the students

649
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:49.700 
often study a subject at a time and those are put together

650
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.750 
in perhaps more flexible ways one of the significant changes

651
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.680 
is that increase in flexibility.

652
00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:02.520 
how about some somewhere like pflp i'm imagining that when

653
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.650 
carlos talks about the job the academics do one of the things academics

654
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.230 
spend a lot of time in is designing curriculum. and by and large we are

655
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.920 
so happy with what we've created that we've got it pretty closed.

656
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.150 
you have to do it in this path you have to follow these and

657
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.980 
you have to make sure all of these things fit together to achieve our outcomes.

658
00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:27.290 
the more stacked curriculum that fill the long is asking about

659
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.330 
is designed to be much more flexible.

660
00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.950 
yes i do agree.

661
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.650 
so basically the idea of open

662
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:42.710 
education at the pfl is we open the window of the lecture room,

663
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:47.300 
so you can you can if you are outside you can do the exercise you can do

664
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.010 
watched videos and so on, but we don't opened it system.

665
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:56.430 
to enter the real system you need to if to come from

666
00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.410 
with the right diploma and so on and so that was an issue

667
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:07.340 
especially when we design some mooc specially targeting french-speaking africa

668
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.570 
that we could not deliver any degree.

669
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:15.000 
you know if the certificate of advanced to the certificate of

670
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.360 
master of advanced to these diploma of advanced to these that

671
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.820 
required to where the master. all disagree reply below by the slow

672
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.520 
to the master, so there was no way we do something open if the

673
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:30.610 
condition is to the master. so we've created a certificate of open studies

674
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.030 
that does not require master

675
00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.740 
to say he does not have a lot of success.

676
00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:42.950 
maybe we did not say it well. because if you're looking for an open

677
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:45.690 
something open may be

678
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.000 
the first place you go is not to be pfl

679
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.230 
john pointed a statistic of which you learn.

680
00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:00.570 
they're quite impressive. you go to open classroom is embarrassing fantastic.

681
00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:05.310 
so the academy all these all these company.

682
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.230 
yeah maybe you know

683
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.660 
some of them Mooks are simply not

684
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:17.460 
not open by content plasma physics. normal people don't want

685
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.450 
to learn about plasma physics. you know

686
00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.790 
advanced fourier transform normal people don't care about it,

687
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.030 
in some way some of the course and just

688
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.520 
not open, because they're not accessible by

689
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.930 
the majority of the folks that go to open university.

690
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.410 
that's interesting point as you gathered from what i said.

691
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.450 
i'm always quite interested in the history of

692
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:45.110 
this distance learning and when the uk open university was

693
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:50.660 
created they made a lot of use of broadcast television,
as putting out television or

694
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:56.260 
radio on the normal bbc public channels at pretty well normal

695
00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.560 
viewing times.
so you could be studying physics at seven o'clock in the evening

696
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.620 
that obviously over time

697
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.120 
just stopped and the television was pushed to a

698
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.590 
rather more uncivilized hours.
but harold wilson the prime minister

699
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.190 
of britain who soon had the idea of the university fee,

700
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:19.670 
as pierre was just saying it was very important to let the

701
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:25.150 
general public observe a university at work by being able to watch

702
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:29.860 
open university courses on television and listen to them on radio.

703
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.440 
but in order to take them for credit,
then they had to go through the process of

704
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:39.860 
of enrolling. and at the moment i think we sort of got a hybrid

705
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.760 
situation i was interested

706
00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:46.210 
that during the during the pandemic the open universities was

707
00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:50.520 
doing its normal things as a free a website of free online

708
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.130 
courses about a thousand of those. the year before the pandemic

709
00:51:55.130 --> 00:52:00.340 
if my memory serves me right they had eight million visits to that website

710
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.970 
to look and see what was available there, whereas during the

711
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.030 
pandemic that rose from eight million to fourteen million. so

712
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.490 
there was a huge appetite in the uk at least during the

713
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.310 
pandemic for people looking for

714
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.910 
free easy come easy go online courses. and that seems to me

715
00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:25.210 
quite an important part of the open agenda, even if

716
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.860 
people like us are rather snooty about high drop-out rates

717
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.950 
and people not completing and so on.
but simply giving people the opportunity to

718
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:42.930 
observe education at work.
i think it is quite important that beyond this open

719
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:50.650 
doors cannot be a breed, this open free courses cannot be a breed as soon

720
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.430 
as you include some physical interaction on campus. so some presence

721
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.780 
at some point there is a cost where there is a salary of the

722
00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.150 
teacher that does not scale up, because you cannot

723
00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:06.170 
have a physical contact with five thousand students and a cost

724
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:07.880 
of traveling to a campus. or

725
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.960 
in some way it is this fully open model

726
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:17.060 
i know the open university has local centres all over the world.

727
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.430 
but in some way the more you open the less

728
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:26.470 
you can mixed physical presence and online interaction.

729
00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:30.250 
but i think that yes i mean that's a good point. but in a

730
00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:35.050 
lot of cases. you've got the sort of spontaneous provision of

731
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:41.610 
in person contact by voluntary groups who decide this is an interesting
open course .

732
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.950 
let's see if we can get together a bunch of people in this region

733
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:49.180 
to discuss it with no link to the original institution.

734
00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:53.660 
i mean this is completely informal. it's not unlike in some ways the

735
00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.080 
the open school in india with its three zero hundred study

736
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.760 
centres.
now they're not just a free for all they have to be accredited and

737
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:07.330 
the national institute has to approve them,
but nevertheless

738
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.810 
the people running them are not in non-governmental organizations

739
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:16.800 
that are interested in disadvantaged children or disability

740
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.590 
or poverty or whatever. and so there's a rather interesting

741
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:27.530 
marriage between openly available materials and then people

742
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.430 
who will support people to get through them. so i think we've

743
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:35.530 
got to and peter touched on this that when a long it should be thinking of

744
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:39.920 
one institution controlling all the tentacles of its activities.

745
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.980 
but simply putting stuff out there and see what happens and

746
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.820 
who picks it up and does things with it.

747
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:49.160 
that at the beginning of the moocs. i remember in inokashira

748
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.020 
smoke's the way a lot of meet-up groups

749
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.560 
meetings spontaneously to meet a group say again. you take the

750
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.470 
mukund scholar you live around luzon let's meet at the train station

751
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:05.900 
coffee. and does anybody in the audience know if this tradition has continued or

752
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.820 
that was something that really

753
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.720 
whether the physical contact missing was kind of re-created

754
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.770 
spontaneously by the participants.
i don't know if this is still

755
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:16.940 
the case i have no clue.

756
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.050 
i think it is i don't i can't speak for coursera. but i think

757
00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:25.970 
the future to learn encourages that kind of thing and invites

758
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:29.350 
learners who are interested in that sort of get in touch and

759
00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:33.900 
they will try and facilitate something. so that the whole point

760
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.450 
in the whole virtue of it i guess is that it's spontaneous and

761
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.780 
happens if people want it and it's easy come easy go.

762
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:47.080 
so christine christine you are talking about physical

763
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:49.760 
meeting groups for class central.

764
00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:57.180 
let's have several questions so let's have the q a and we have

765
00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.990 
the chat we have from both sides and the writer

766
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:04.880 
has several questions in a row, i think peter scott wants to answer them.

767
00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:06.800 
they want to go ahead peter,

768
00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:12.190 
whether the freedom yeah i know i was just saying so dora's

769
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:16.120 
questions are really really good about trying to help us think.

770
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:20.380 
you know we spend a lot of time talking about the institution
the institution needs

771
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.230 
rather than what the learning needs and was one of the things.

772
00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:27.330 
i was trying to try to draw out i think

773
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.320 
learners need more flexibility and what john is talking about

774
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.870 
is reaching to them at scale and what pierre is talking about is

775
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:43.190 
something else i i'm talking about nothing

776
00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:47.060 
no no i again i think it's a it's about

777
00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:50.590 
in terms of what the learner's experience is there's no doubt

778
00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:53.880 
you're creating great experiences. so i'll actually maybe

779
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.980 
throw to one of marcus's questions actually mark respect us

780
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:03.280 
when we talk about curriculum. but actually lots of our learners

781
00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:07.080 
are growing in other ways, you know dora has said it's about

782
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.950 
skills it's about connection.

783
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.810 
you know an mba learner will tell you that they are as interested

784
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:16.870 
in the networks, they're creating as the

785
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:18.860 
content that they're navigating.

786
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.470 
so again that is another interesting topic for us to be thinking

787
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:23.980 
about as we're looking at that

788
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:26.760 
how that hybrid experience might work.

789
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.540 
so

790
00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:34.660 
go ahead it was a question of the i about vocational training.

791
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.610 
i had a nice experience on that vocational

792
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:42.280 
training in the centre of switzerland to survey teenagers learn

793
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.810 
a job when they're sixteen four days per week in a company.

794
00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.210 
one day per week at school and the director of school told

795
00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:50.330 
me pierre i have a problem with my carpenters.

796
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:54.340 
you know they are good carpenters, but they we felt they will fail the final

797
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:56.970 
graduation because of mathematics.

798
00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.970 
would you do something like a move for mathematics for us?

799
00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:04.970 
your kids and me you send me you you teachers,

800
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:09.500 
and we did we did a move and then i went back to the school

801
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.640 
and say i had a teacher or is it going on that you should say

802
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.070 
that's on my students anymore.

803
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.230 
there's question

804
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:21.440 
ask question for the first time and they've watched the mooc

805
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.910 
of mathematics on a sunday afternoon you know when they wake up at five

806
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:29.230 
or five o'clock. so there was was quite an experience because

807
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.970 
books were so much connected to academia

808
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:36.630 
that aving such an appropriation by future

809
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.640 
mentors was a very positive experience. but it was not done

810
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.520 
by us we riches help the school to do it. i mean we have different

811
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.290 
networks we that that's the reality.

812
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:54.740 
ok there's so many questions there i mean let me read you a ridiculous question

813
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.980 
from very early on he says i think students are flexible and

814
00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.030 
will choose the university that best matches the expectations.

815
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.790 
this is even easier when the university is providing pure concessions,

816
00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:08.970 
then students can choose the university mainly that is provided

817
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.560 
rather than the physical occasion which might force them to relocate

818
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.240 
although when you are following a program normally you want

819
00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.990 
to get the final certificate no of course.

820
00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.980 
i think that the different phases so. maybe at the bachelor level

821
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:34.290 
the students are less choosing a very specific program with

822
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:37.100 
a very broad programming and after three years at the bachelor

823
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.910 
when they go for the master maybe they know better exactly what the

824
00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:42.690 
what the

825
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:46.960 
specific curriculum they want to do. but i can tell you about

826
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.200 
the students that i meet who are

827
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:53.450 
no high school students, so before to commit bfl

828
00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:58.740 
they choose a curriculum but they also through the campus i mean

829
00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.230 
the kind of it's not only the beauty but the kind of ambience

830
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:04.920 
they feel on the campus either part of the choice.

831
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:09.890 
i think they say we've got a long way to go before this mix

832
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:14.470 
and match thing really becomes a reality for most students.

833
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:18.750 
and that's actually because and pierre peter touched on this a bit

834
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:23.930 
of the policies that institutions have that essentially

835
01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:29.940 
force or encourage students to stay with particular
programs in particular institutions.

836
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:36.120 
i mean way back in the late seventy s when i was a mathematics
university in canada.

837
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:42.450 
we created what was canada's first non residential degree program

838
01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.250 
now in that context non residential isn't about where you live. it's about

839
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:52.580 
having to do a certain proportion of your degree at that particular institution.

840
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:58.080 
so we simply said ok come along and bring us the credits
that you've taken wherever

841
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:02.430 
and we will put them together and if you have what seems to be

842
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:07.060 
the equivalent of a sensible programming degree we will give that to you.

843
01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.650 
i think the other universities in canada again. this is

844
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:15.480 
in the seventies thought this is the end of civilization as they knew it.

845
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:22.150 
and i sense that the moment if anything residential
requirements actually tightening up

846
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.690 
as universities particularly north america and particularly the US.

847
01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:32.900 
begin to feel something difficulties on student enrollment and therefore finances

848
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:37.730 
so clearly if you can keep your own students and not let them

849
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:41.740 
go and take courses elsewhere that's helpful to you. so there's a

850
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:45.950 
a counter trend which i think is unfortunate.

851
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.680 
because i'm a great believer that there should be as much freedom

852
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.970 
as possible to make some mache and put things

853
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.930 
together into qualifications stacking them as peter was saying.

854
01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.050 
interesting question that anger our cyngor duncan lang seth said

855
01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:07.420 
will moose in the first year contribute to selecting students

856
01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:11.090 
in the second year in your master. i think maybe that's none

857
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:12.850 
of the things you were talking about pierre.

858
01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.830 
the idea that you can have these much more flexible pathways

859
01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:20.310 
coming into an existing program and that universities will credit them.

860
01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.840 
because often they are created by other universities who are

861
01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.560 
in their own right perfectly reputable.

862
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:30.820 
so it's a really good question that we're asking of our academics what why

863
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:33.950 
you know all corrections pretty good. but the student wants

864
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:38.310 
to spend a significant amount of their effort studying at another university

865
01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:43.310 
bring those outcomes to us how easy should it be to judge how

866
01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:46.900 
they fit to our curriculum, and put them onto a pathway for our reward.

867
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.270 
it really shouldn't be that hard at all.

868
01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.790 
it is hard, i mean professor for the flexibility is not the

869
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.690 
part of the concept of the epf first year

870
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.060 
we use not to welcome students with very different backgrounds.

871
01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.890 
we do with diversity,

872
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:16.010 
but it is still one degree required some kind of
high school degree required to enter.

873
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:22.130 
then yes most can tolerate variation about this professor.

874
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:25.040 
some of them have more mathematics than others in high school and

875
01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.210 
then we hope that with this MOOC they can compensate for the

876
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.530 
partially missing skills. but i would not call that flexibility

877
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:34.830 
that would be an oversell.

878
01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.300 
it's a bit different at the

879
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:41.430 
later on when especially when you want to change degree,

880
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:45.530 
when you change want to change a curriculum between a bachelor and a master

881
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:49.750 
like you have a bachelor in computer science and you want to make a master

882
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.630 
in applied statistics, then there

883
01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:00.100 
which there is more space for flexibility. the first year there

884
01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.580 
is a minor space. it's basically accommodating the variation

885
01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.640 
of pre-requisite skills among the students.

886
01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.790 
so it's kind of flexibility,

887
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:16.240 
but narrow. this interesting question by feel long again,

888
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:21.240 
how can union universities do better at skills mapping.

889
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.290 
he says faculty typically and is attentive to the challenge of mapping

890
01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:29.030 
academic learning outcomes to skills and competences of occupations.

891
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.870 
so how can university it's a bit longer but how can universities

892
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:34.380 
do this mapping better?

893
01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:39.280 
better that sounds like your question?

894
01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:45.870 
yes we're doing a lot on that i'd have to say so we have big programs which are

895
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:50.350 
mapping our curriculum to skills outcomes in particular

896
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:55.160 
work related skills outcomes. we have a really lovely project called

897
01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:03.340 
track tailored analytics which extracts skills from the world's

898
01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:07.890 
job adverts, and regional job adverts and then maps them to our curriculum.

899
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:11.280 
so it helps us to rethink our curriculum and see how our curriculum

900
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.130 
fits into work integrated pathways for our students. so we can say to

901
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.110 
an inquirer who comes in and talks to some of our concierge

902
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:23.810 
services to try and think about flexible learning
that will suit their requirements

903
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:28.320 
that if they want a job in one of our local areas these are

904
01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.370 
the skills that are required this is the mix of micro credentials

905
01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:34.900 
and curriculum that will help you get those skills.

906
01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.550 
and we're also now starting to look phillip at working with

907
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:43.020 
businesses as well to be able to say these are the managers

908
01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.990 
you want to develop these are the workers who need these new things,

909
01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:52.100 
they tell us tell us send us in some data about cvs send us

910
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.680 
some data about roles we'll extract some of the skills from those

911
01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:58.940 
build some maps of those skills and see if we can map them to

912
01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:03.190 
things that we can do curriculum or things we don't do which

913
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:06.120 
is the gaps for the curriculum we should be choosing or where

914
01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.340 
you can get that from or get it from somewhere else. so actually

915
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:13.190 
we're getting much better at using automated techniques to

916
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:17.870 
try and get there that are far from perfect.
but actually it's also not

917
01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:19.390 
exactly rocket science.

918
01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:24.220 
in vancouver at the extend the school of management we're working

919
01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.080 
more and more with professional associations. i've been amazed

920
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.910 
to learn how many professional associations there are

921
01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:37.340 
for what i've considered very specialized areas like logistics supply chain management.

922
01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.930 
and these people actually are

923
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.580 
enormously helpful in grounding you in the realities of

924
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.980 
trying to train your students fall.

925
01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:52.830 
and that's been a most productive alliance on many dimensions.

926
01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:58.060 
he no case with the two approaches, every curriculum has an

927
01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:01.680 
advisory board made of people over the industry that meet that

928
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.410 
meet once every euro every seven year. so the traditional approach

929
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:09.620 
look at the curriculum you miss the skills in this one which is a bit

930
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:14.210 
slow. then and then we try we're exploring peter's approaches so

931
01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.980 
using machine learning on job ads to extract skills and

932
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:24.470 
especially is still a research thing is not in practice.

933
01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:31.260 
but it seems that some companies are much better than others to anticipate

934
01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.220 
new skills. and these are not the companies

935
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:38.430 
we expect these are not the google apple and so on these are

936
01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.620 
the smaller companies and we don't know if yet the

937
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:46.740 
profile, but some companies we have to be spotted because that's

938
01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:50.540 
the company that are the the first one on the job market to

939
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:54.270 
to announce new required skills.

940
01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:02.370 
but the s in the lead asks about how can the mostly face to

941
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:07.020 
face based contact in the personal experience from studies on campus

942
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:09.530 
be transferred into the digital world.

943
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.440 
so perrer showed this green to red say

944
01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:21.220 
so the social life is the most difficult to transfer to the digital

945
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.490 
is it impossible or other apps like i mean the dating apps.

946
01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:31.560 
so why shouldn't we give your social life up for the university.

947
01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:34.760 
why don't you say it's that difficult we

948
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:39.020 
again in vancouver. we made a lot of use of what we call our

949
01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:43.300 
student ambassadors these are upper level students who have shown them

950
01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:47.550 
selves to be rather get up and go an extrovert. and they did

951
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:52.030 
a terrific job of putting on virtual events for the other students

952
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:54.730 
when they were locked down at home. and

953
01:08:55.890 --> 01:09:00.550 
but what we found was that the students fairly quickly, it wasn't

954
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:03.900 
so much the social life that they were missing they could make

955
01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:07.710 
that for themselves. but it was anything to do with helping them

956
01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.490 
in the learning journey they were making.

957
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:14.590 
so recordings of the professor's lectures and so on. but of course

958
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.990 
the downside of that for the institution is that the more you make it,

959
01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:23.980 
easy and comfortable for people not to come to campus.

960
01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.760 
the more they will take part- time jobs

961
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.550 
and fill up their lives with other things and obviously they

962
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:33.560 
save a lot of time in travel in a place like vancouver.

963
01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:37.350 
so it's a complex, it's a complex

964
01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:43.100 
situation. and i think we were surprised because our institution has

965
01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.450 
mostly foreign students. and we assumed that they were coming

966
01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.980 
for the classroom experience. but as we begin to prepare

967
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:55.290 
to go back to the classroom.
we can see that there's a little push back because

968
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:59.250 
they've got to like the freedom of setting their own timetable

969
01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:02.550 
studying when they want and how they want. and i'm not sure

970
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:06.080 
how they will resolve that which is why i said at the beginning that

971
01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.560 
we won't know until at least the end of twenty

972
01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:14.730 
nineteen or twenty twenty to how this whole thing is going to settle down,

973
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:18.710 
and what universities will really do. those that have to be

974
01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:22.290 
attentive to what their students want that's not already the case in

975
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.150 
an institution like ps because if they get in they do what

976
01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:30.070 
they're told but in many institutions nowadays there is a lot of

977
01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:32.290 
choice saying that is

978
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.170 
in many ways.

979
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:39.460 
a convention first of all we have a different variety of students

980
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:43.630 
and some of them were insulting me when i said it will be online when

981
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.770 
some of them were insulting me when i said it will be on site.

982
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:52.060 
so we have a variety of them we had to promise to our students that

983
01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.760 
even if the pandemic improve and it does improve the

984
01:10:55.770 --> 01:11:02.040 
situation, and improve we will end up the semester online. because many of them

985
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:06.900 
are leaving from france or from elsewhere they have to pay

986
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.570 
rent and they say i'm not going to pay rent in lausanne which is quite expensive.

987
01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:14.450 
if basically i still online can stay with my parents.

988
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:15.690 
so we have to promise the other way

989
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:22.770 
iran not to not to come back too quickly to the face to face,

990
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:28.480 
but no i still disagree with you john the online the online social life.

991
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:33.810 
we read coaches we paint mentors and coach that follow this

992
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:39.630 
the young young students on either curriculum aspects or more life aspect.

993
01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:44.140 
so we did what we could but down the road i mean john john

994
01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:47.140 
if you want to invite your grandkids for dinner.

995
01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.830 
and you have the choice

996
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.850 
where they will come to the bar beyond you or you will put

997
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:56.210 
a desktop on the bar with their face.

998
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.970 
maybe

999
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:03.990 
that's true, but all this is for student

1000
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.910 
particularly is a trade off. okay this is not as good as

1001
01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.260 
the real thing, but if i take the online version then i get

1002
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:18.440 
more time in my day, then i get more opportunities to do other things.

1003
01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:22.360 
so this is i think the thing that institutions have to juggle with

1004
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:27.550 
if they are dealing particularly with part-time students or students who

1005
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:31.190 
have choice and are not in a selective institution.

1006
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:35.570 
so it's not straightforward in my view yeah i have

1007
01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:39.910 
to echo something between what both of you are saying actually

1008
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:44.650 
sometimes the online is a lot better it really really is sometimes.
it's much better

1009
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:49.090 
not to travel sometimes our students are telling us that.

1010
01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:53.240 
now it doesn't mean as you as you say pm that you know the thing

1011
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:56.560 
like dinner with grandchildren. isn't really important and magical

1012
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.740 
and that for me is the key what we're looking at now on our

1013
01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.220 
campus for the hybrid experiences if you're going to be on

1014
01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:06.630 
campus and gonna travel go to all that trouble to come and

1015
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:11.840 
join us in a physical space it better be magical. and that mustn't mean

1016
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.250 
someone standing at the front doing what they could have done on a video.

1017
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:21.410 
it must mean engaging group work talking networking or some

1018
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:25.910 
of the things that are quite hard although often even better digitally.

1019
01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.890 
but where there's a magical element to that in presence thing, because

1020
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.190 
it's a big investment.

1021
01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:36.960 
we pay a lot for our beautiful campuses, it also has beautiful buildings

1022
01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:37.660 
of glass.

1023
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:44.530 
we have many beautiful buildings but we only want to do magical things in them

1024
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:49.390 
and that actually is a limited number of things that you know you can't

1025
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:53.000 
as john would say you could do some of those things online a lot better.

1026
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.500 
so that's where the hybrid comes in with respect to the mixing of mode.

1027
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.820 
but that's a very important point that peter has made i mean

1028
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:06.950 
going back quite a number of years. i know in some american

1029
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:10.440 
universities that what kind of computer calls themselves

1030
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.960 
commuter campuses were finding that they got themselves into

1031
01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.120 
a kind of vicious circle that the fewer students who came to

1032
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.710 
campus because of other opportunities the less interesting the campus experience

1033
01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.080 
became and therefore the institutions were left with this terrific

1034
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:32.610 
investment in buildings and fewer and few be interested in

1035
01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:36.490 
using them. because as you say the experience is not magical

1036
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:40.230 
at all. it was dark and there were few people there. so it's

1037
01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:43.910 
a very tree i'm very glad i'm not president of a campus university

1038
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:44.500 
at the moment.

1039
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:53.560 
but peter first of all we have stolen the word for maria mckee road magical before

1040
01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.510 
before you say it so you have the

1041
01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:00.200 
apologize for pleasure to apologize to mary. but i mean you

1042
01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.640 
are doing marketing. ok as i was doing it because you know it's

1043
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.480 
easy to say we need to with a campus magical, then i have to speak to

1044
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:12.310 
four hundred professor and three hundred teachers and making

1045
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:17.290 
a campus magical or making the teaching experience magical. it's good

1046
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:20.620 
to say, but it's easy to say but that's

1047
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.820 
between us you know if nobody is listening that's much more

1048
01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.270 
difficult to achieve.

1049
01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:35.350 
okay more questions, we have both on- and in the chat

1050
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:37.490 
cuneo is difficult to

1051
01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:41.220 
that i for instance he says looks like the future we're talking

1052
01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.990 
about the near future. anyone wants to talk about medium long term future.

1053
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.620 
even more difficult.

1054
01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:53.660 
when in the long term we're all dead. but i think

1055
01:15:55.650 --> 01:16:01.580 
as i tried to noted in my presentation i do think we are not

1056
01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:07.440 
sufficiently aware of the tidal wave of people who are going to be seeking

1057
01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:11.520 
education at all levels including higher and continuing education

1058
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.580 
in the next twenty thirty years. i mean we are talking hundreds

1059
01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.970 
of millions of people. and

1060
01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.190 
i'm not sure the world is really gearing itself up for that

1061
01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:28.010 
back in the nineties director. but when i calculated that to deal with the

1062
01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:33.540 
coming needs. we needed to create one large campus university every day

1063
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:37.760 
somewhere in the world and that wasn't happening.

1064
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.460 
so i'm not sure we're sufficiently aware yet of the demand that is coming

1065
01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.960 
and the flexibility that will be required to respond to it.

1066
01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.280 
michael spectre's also too comments i think designing the come

1067
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.660 
to experience is one thing.
but help to grow the networks between students might be

1068
01:16:55.950 --> 01:17:00.450 
different. and then i wonder what our kids will say about all of this

1069
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:04.100 
none of us had the periods in our life like the last two years.

1070
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:09.150 
probably in the war so what will that do to the next generation of students.

1071
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:13.610 
in my case i have always journalist,

1072
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.230 
asking me are you going to deliver

1073
01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:24.700 
with degrees like sagen no lower lower degrees.

1074
01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.350 
because the quality of teaching and so on.

1075
01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:33.710 
and i said come on this the exam were the same.

1076
01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:38.070 
so these kids if if if reach the same level of expertise despite

1077
01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:41.580 
being stuck at home. and so on so these are survivors,

1078
01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:46.550 
if i was a boss i would hire any child who leaves university after

1079
01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:50.660 
after the pandemic wave, because these people the students have been

1080
01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:56.190 
at a real resilience there with the very fighting to this.

1081
01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.760 
perhaps less at the university level,

1082
01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:05.270 
but i think there's a generation during the pandemic some of the big

1083
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:10.260 
examining bodies like the international baccalaureate many national bodies

1084
01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.250 
kind of closed down. and i think the kids who went through that,

1085
01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:19.940 
and did not get the formal qualification for their secondary school education.

1086
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:24.160 
but were judged by their teachers and something they may be

1087
01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:28.110 
worried needlessly, but i think there is a lot of worry out there

1088
01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:33.850 
that they will be a lost generation sandwiched between generations

1089
01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:36.970 
who went through in the normal way and got the exams they are

1090
01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:40.410 
meant to get. so i don't think we should make light of the worries

1091
01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:44.180 
that students themselves may have about the fact they missed out on

1092
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:48.840 
the real thing. come on come on john day they spent twelve years at school.

1093
01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:51.870 
when they come to pfl that that's

1094
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:56.740 
five more years and seventeen years on thirty four semesters

1095
01:18:56.950 --> 01:19:01.500 
and during the thirty and among the thirty those semesters

1096
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.700 
of education thirty four semester of education that basically

1097
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.220 
who are in one full so two semester out of the thirty four

1098
01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:13.480 
that they've been online. i mean i don't see it as a collapse.

1099
01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.760 
i'm not worried about the ones you get to epfl. i'm worried about

1100
01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.530 
those who sort of scraped through their high school but didn't actually get the

1101
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:28.060 
pieces of paper that they would normally get. but i'm digressing because

1102
01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.690 
i guess here we're mostly talking about higher and continuing

1103
01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:38.260 
education. but i do think that the impact of covid-19 on people.

1104
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:42.740 
and we all know that it is dramatically increased inequality

1105
01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:47.840 
on a whole number of dimensions and not least on the educational dimension. so

1106
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:50.030 
i don't think we should make light of any of that

1107
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:59.080 
i'd like to put up a question and we're talking i mean talking

1108
01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.630 
online is more efficient you can put many things online and

1109
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:05.540 
you don't waste so much time in commuting.

1110
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:10.860 
but what about i mean i don't know i do but i'm in sitting

1111
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.380 
in front of my desk the whole day from meeting to meeting.

1112
01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:18.740 
you can have more meetings you're always on time or if you have

1113
01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:22.350 
or lobbying you you can even have two screens what about the

1114
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:25.740 
mental health. now and sometimes commuting is good, because it's

1115
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:29.060 
you you think about other things and your relax a little bit

1116
01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:33.760 
of about being focused all the time. how about these health issues

1117
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:39.100 
should they be considered somehow. because they have not come up yet

1118
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.210 
i think it's a big problem for full time students and again

1119
01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:48.180 
in this discussion we've tended to slip into talking about

1120
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:53.620 
young full time students. if you're a someone in their thirties or fourties

1121
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:57.900 
going back to university to learn something new.

1122
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.430 
you're much less fussed about that because you've got other

1123
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:05.760 
opportunities in your life not to be online and you're much

1124
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.590 
less concerned that the university should provide you with

1125
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:13.840 
a social life. so and in the future they will be the large numbers

1126
01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.410 
of students that we're dealing with.

1127
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:21.880 
in our case about so mental else we who had a lot of

1128
01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:28.540 
let's say an exotic all is under the article, but one by one evidence of

1129
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.760 
people expressing the suffering austin is expressing oh much a suffer.

1130
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:37.680 
yet we have this free consultancy for psychological service.

1131
01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:42.420 
and the requests the number of requests did not increase surprisingly may be

1132
01:21:42.710 --> 01:21:48.760 
they did not trust it. I don't know. and the the level of dropout

1133
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:56.090 
was stable actually slightly lower than usually. so we had very

1134
01:21:56.570 --> 01:22:00.120 
informal accounts of these mental suffering of our students

1135
01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.640 
but it did not turn it into

1136
01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:12.160 
statistical evidence that we could use we we increased the offer of support

1137
01:22:12.370 --> 01:22:14.060 
psychological support. and

1138
01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.720 
that was not so popular

1139
01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:20.980 
i think you're unusual in that respect pierre. because i think

1140
01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:25.010 
most institutions and most countries have found a massive

1141
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:30.940 
increase in sort of appeals for mental health help for students and young people

1142
01:22:31.630 --> 01:22:36.590 
in many ways. so again was it journalist reports or was it data

1143
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.190 
i live in a country where journalists use data.

1144
01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:50.830 
what happens if the number of learners doubled triple or grow

1145
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:56.230 
ten times are the issues of scale with our current approaches as try

1146
01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:02.340 
well i suppose that was really the nub of what i was saying that we must

1147
01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:09.140 
preserve the ability to do distance education and scaling as in a quasi

1148
01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:14.220 
industrial is a bad word these days.
but in a quasi industrial manner because

1149
01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:17.650 
you're never going to deal with hundreds of millions of

1150
01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:21.600 
new students in the developing world simply by adding

1151
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:28.080 
some lone range of online courses. i think there's a terrific place for that

1152
01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:34.810 
but and the problem i think is that these large providers are

1153
01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:38.770 
really very difficult to organize and maintain because i think

1154
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:43.470 
once you get to two hundred thousand half a million a million

1155
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:45.490 
students in one institution.

1156
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:49.590 
there's a great tendency for the wheels to fall off unless the

1157
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:56.190 
management and leadership of those institutions is really quite
extraordinarily good and

1158
01:23:56.330 --> 01:24:00.860 
when you see these large scale institutions failing. i think it's because

1159
01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:06.320 
there isn't enough attention paid to those issues so that people from

1160
01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.780 
conventional universities are appointed to run these places.

1161
01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:13.840 
and they really have no commitment to the less advantaged and

1162
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.950 
no idea really how to run logistics on a very large scale.

1163
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:20.010 
so i think this is a big challenge for the future.

1164
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.530 
and i think one more question where close to half past.

1165
01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:30.630 
philae belong says one thing about the importance of the place of space.

1166
01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:34.390 
it resende of the campus to provide quiet comfortable learning

1167
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:38.570 
environments with proximate support for student services
medical laboratory etcetera,

1168
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:42.380 
maybe a better use of campus space than classrooms buildings places

1169
01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.740 
rather than spaces. no in our case at my university

1170
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:49.520 
some things are online some are on site and

1171
01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.430 
you students cannot go home between classes. no if you have two

1172
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:58.200 
on site classes one on in between you have to provide space also

1173
01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:02.530 
for this online classes on campus. so so the importance of of

1174
01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:05.820 
places and redesigning this but phil is asking about.

1175
01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:14.350 
a massive growth in architects who are who are advising universities

1176
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:19.040 
on just that how to convert space into attractive spaces that

1177
01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.050 
students want to be.

1178
01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:22.830 
one thing we are

1179
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:26.790 
doing for the future is for intensive with

1180
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:32.790 
first of always many teachers as we know need lecture rooms with

1181
01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:36.670 
five hundred to six hundred seats. and we said no way because

1182
01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:39.890 
if you are there but in the back of the room you see the teacher

1183
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:44.030 
smaller than on your iphone. so that makes no much sense and

1184
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:45.870 
we are discussing new rooms.

1185
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:51.110 
but that will be in several years where the lecture theatre

1186
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:57.230 
is not in stand out slope but with terrace so that you can students can turn

1187
01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.920 
they can walk in teams they can come when there is no lecture

1188
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.820 
they can come and walk there and so on so it is a space that

1189
01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:05.750 
can be used both for lecturing and as a walking space.

1190
01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:09.460 
but i have to say the urgency is september

1191
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:16.150 
for us and we we are fighting now to find

1192
01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:21.210 
a basis because the population has increased the campus as

1193
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:23.610 
teaching rooms have not increased.

1194
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:27.410 
so we part of them will be streamed

1195
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:32.230 
and the students will choose whether they watch the real

1196
01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:36.430 
life lecture a real time lecture at home or in another room

1197
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:41.860 
on campus because they have something else on next to so the the teaching space

1198
01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:45.130 
it is a fight is a fight.

1199
01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:50.610 
so we stopped building teared lecture theatres a long time ago.

1200
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:56.760 
so the last five to eight years we've been building these collaborative

1201
01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:02.550 
spaces that he is talking about is very large two hundred three hundred auditoria

1202
01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:03.470 
but flat four

1203
01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:07.740 
designed with technology to connect people together

1204
01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:12.790 
and for group work. so we're designing group work at scale and

1205
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:15.650 
for large classes not at all the scale that john is talking

1206
01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:17.610 
about but the scale of large classes.

1207
01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:22.520 
so we've been building those spaces for a long time and recognizing

1208
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.460 
that the use of our spaces needs to be flexible so in us his library.

1209
01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.410 
we've noted for many many years that you know what happens

1210
01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:36.310 
at around five o'clock is that the jeans leave the building

1211
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:39.980 
and the suits come into the building, because the workers are

1212
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.180 
coming in for their evening

1213
01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.580 
their evening work their evening learning and teaching flow

1214
01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:47.290 
into the library and start to use our resources.

1215
01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.840 
then because we've tried to make the campus really corus
at the center of the city

1216
01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.740 
so this opened the city flowing in and out so the design of

1217
01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:57.810 
space is really really critical. but one of things that i'd say

1218
01:27:57.950 --> 01:28:00.640 
is the design of the virtual space is just as important

1219
01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:05.080 
because the virtual spaces have to match the physical spaces

1220
01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:07.150 
where you're trying to do this hybrid thing.

1221
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:12.830 
and we've also noted that we were back open sydney hasn't

1222
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:15.180 
had much in the way of a pandemic.

1223
01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:20.310 
we cannot hear peter saw

1224
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:26.540 
lost your voice in a case i think we can finish here it's half

1225
01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:30.910 
past with these challenges about spaces physical spaces and

1226
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:33.790 
virtual space. i'd like to thank all these

1227
01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:38.140 
people posing very interesting questions and the three of you

1228
01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:42.230 
for your great insights and experience and

1229
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:46.510 
conveying all the wisdom to the audience. thank you very much.

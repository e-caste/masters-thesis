Hi my name is Johnannes Rudolph. I have studied Wirtschaftinformatik at the Technical

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.790 
University of Darmstadt and did my research on cloud computing

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.430 
markets especially focusing on platforms as a service.

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.130 
I'm a co-founder and CTO at meshcloud which is a startup that

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.520 
helps big organizations build cloud foundations. So all the

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.980 
foundational layer that organizations need to adopt and embrace

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250 
the cloud at scale for customers like Volkswagen or Commerzbank.

8
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.070 
In this course I'm going to focus on the practical perspective

9
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.140 
of how we can apply sustainable software engineering practices

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.710 
in typical software development settings. So with typical teams

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.540 
working on typical products with typical stakeholders.

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.780 
And I'm also going to focus on cloud computing and the opportunities

13
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.550 
that it brings to us to build more sustainable software, especially looking at the

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.240 
intersection of what happens between organizational and technological

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.230 
change and the market forces that shape our cloud computing markets.

1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.650 
welcome to second session of the experience track. so

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.100 
we will start with a paper from the m f university in turkey with

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.040 
a pocket estimate as a represent it. and a topic is on

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.830 
based online instruction. a case study in teacher education move based online

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.170 
learning a case study in teacher education. so basically what

6
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.610 
we did as we took an x mark we turned it into a b mark.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.770 
and then we gave it as an elective course in our university.

8
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.340 
so i was involved in the paper caroline and zaha i am educational technology coordinator

9
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.480 
at math. and i am new to the position i got it

10
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.170 
a few months ago.

11
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.610 
i'm accepting people into the conference by the way.

12
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.310 
sorry and livia a student assistant also helped us.

13
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.010 
with the paper she conducted the interviews.

14
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.090 
so how do we decide to give this course?

15
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.100 
it was a senate decision we they decided on a micro credentials

16
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
program they called the digital platform electives ap math.

17
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.120 
and basically students can choose can use my MOOCs for elective courses

18
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.480 
and the aim was to recognize non-formal learning.

19
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
and we launched the program in the spring

20
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.700 
semester of two thousand

21
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.960 
actually before covert and this course was also planned before college.

22
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.250 
so how does the micro credentials program work? students choose a mooc,

23
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.120 
they inform their faculty they actually now the system

24
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.070 
is that the students vote

25
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.940 
for a mooc. an instructor is allocated

26
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
to the mooc and based on the content instructor designs learning outcomes.

27
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.970 
and an end of the semester performance task that tests the learning outcomes.

28
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.190 
the course curriculum and

29
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.480 
he or she has to include at least two synchronous lessons.

30
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.830 
and so y two. i don't think this is evidence based.

31
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.340 
we just thought that two would be good for

32
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.450 
dialogue. and yes so there's a more detailed description of

33
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.040 
the program on our website.

34
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.870 
so the purpose of the research to investigate the efficacy

35
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.470 
of the design and implementation of a digital platform electives

36
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.010 
course and micro credentials program course from the perspective of students and

37
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.430 
instructor. and the name of the course was flipped learning in education elective.

38
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.900 
and the mooc was based on flipped learning.

39
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.590 
and it was given to faculty of education students,

40
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.420 
they took the course.

41
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.980 
faculty of education students saw the details about the course flipped learning

42
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.720 
three point o that was the name of the mooc that was based on.

43
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.730 
and rapid transition to online learning this was a minimum

44
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.840 
that was integrated after code nineteen shot down

45
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.610 
to the curriculum and caroline. she's one of the authors she

46
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.950 
was the course instructor.

47
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.360 
investigating best practices for course design.

48
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.460 
so like i said with no i realized that it was going to be a b mark.

49
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.520 
so we drew on suggestions from the literature and also used

50
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.220 
our experience with flipped learning which is a type of

51
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.930 
blended learning. and we looked at global elements of elective

52
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.960 
effective flipped learning

53
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.040 
which you can find on flg global's website.

54
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.290 
which gives best practices for flipped learning.

55
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.100 
course design stage one course outcomes.

56
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.900 
we did a context some sort of a context analysis, we thought about

57
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.080 
what our students' needs might be what our local needs are.

58
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.650 
and then we developed learning outcomes based on the content.

59
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.010 
we basically looked at the content and

60
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.060 
deduced the learning outcomes following blume's taxonomy and

61
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.320 
focus on higher levels of thinking.

62
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.430 
stage two assessment there were four different types of assessment the more certifications.

63
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.270 
participation in one synchronous online lesson. the so there

64
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.820 
were supposed to be two lessons, but the first one was not graded. but

65
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.630 
the last one was an indoor and of course performance desk designed

66
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.540 
with backwards design and tested the terminal outcomes

67
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.420 
that was supported by robert gant was an alternative test. the

68
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.610 
students had to choose a skill write a flipped lesson plan and teach it,

69
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.310 
however they were not able to teach it due to

70
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.960 
campus closures, and then peer and self evaluations.

71
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.620 
units so a simple logical workflow was followed. we labeled everything

72
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.610 
we tried to make a surprise portions that could properly spruce course.

73
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.860 
and paste learning. and we involved active learning

74
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.960 
by drawing on flipped learning philosophy.

75
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.380 
and then after pedagogy we went on to IT decisions

76
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.150 
to basically chose a proper IT to help us with our version

77
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.730 
and this is what the course

78
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.740 
page looked like.

79
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.710 
so the course ran with forty students research methodology

80
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.070 
ran with four students over thirteen weeks.

81
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.390 
a case study methodology with mixed methods was followed. and

82
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.040 
our research question was how effective was the football vision course

83
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.480 
regarding student achievable learning outcomes engagement with

84
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.310 
all my systems tools and materials and satisfaction.

85
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.170 
so for the three indicators that i've just

86
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.290 
counted are we for the first one for the outcomes we just looked at the greats.

87
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.860 
for engagement with all my systems through the materials. we

88
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.810 
looked at the activity on the lms on the mch website

89
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.460 
a virtual meeting space and other communication collaboration force.

90
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.330 
and for satisfaction we sent out at 22 question a survey

91
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.450 
only eight students completed in total.

92
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.540 
and for the qualitative data we interviewed students and the course instructor,

93
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.010 
and four students were interviewed in total

94
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.760 
based on voluntary sampling, it wasn't purposeful.

95
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:36.300 
and yeah yeah we did the analysis following brown and clark.
and here is

96
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.550 
how the coding and imitating process worked.

97
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.180 
we use the software called the cortex to organize testimonials, and then

98
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.200 
make inferences.

99
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.800 
so the results and findings indicated one achievement or learning outcomes.

100
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.060 
the grades were either very high for all of the learning outcomes or

101
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:08.090 
above average one outcome that was low was produce an effective pre class video

102
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.560 
that was just a little higher than fifty
percent the average cross grade.

103
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.780 
indicator two engagement with all my systems through the materials.

104
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.700 
so all of the students even though not all students passed

105
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.210 
the course all completed the most certifications.

106
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.120 
there were thirty seven announcements in total in fourteen weeks. and

107
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.630 
the teacher had to send caroline and some two hundred emails over the semester.

108
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:43.460 
so those numbers look big compared to other courses

109
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.230 
in the discussion board virtual office student chat room which were all voluntary

110
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.350 
were not used or requested from the students.

111
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.460 
satisfaction most students were very happy with the course

112
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.560 
and they thought that the assessment was meaningful

113
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.660 
and that this course will help them in their future careers,

114
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.750 
also we provided the students with a lesson plan template an

115
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.730 
example lesson plan an example lesson regarding their final assessment

116
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.930 
the performance task where they have to plan a flipped lesson.

117
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.980 
so we provided a lot of examples to increase dialogue,

118
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.040 
and they found those very useful.

119
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.320 
and i would like to have more synchronous online lessons in this course

120
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.000 
staggering only twenty-five percent i said yes to this. so they

121
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.880 
were very happy with the asynchronous ways the course was conducted.

122
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.180 
so the combined data analysis of the quantitative data. and

123
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.480 
qualitative data revealed three overarching themes. these were

124
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.130 
quality and quantity of communication and collaboration

125
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.890 
significance for career development and suitability of the mooc.

126
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.180 
so four quality and quantity of communication and collaboration

127
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.020 
like i said there were a lot of

128
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.690 
announcements and emails sent by the teacher and the discussion

129
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.110 
boards which are office virtual chat rooms were not used. so

130
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.490 
the students instead of asking each other were questions to discover

131
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.260 
how the course was conducted they rather just emailed the teacher

132
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.300 
and asked them questions.

133
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.920 
and based on the interviews students

134
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.130 
said that they chose whatsapp to communicate with their close

135
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.320 
friends and ask them questions about the course

136
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.570 
answered the two lessons that were meant that

137
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.220 
were made mandatory by the micro credentials program.

138
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.370 
the second lesson so the instructor said that the second lesson

139
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.280 
was successful compared to the first as it had a specific task

140
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.910 
and objective and was graded.

141
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.780 
i'm like i said before working fully a synchronous thirty-seven

142
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.030 
percent said that working in a fully a service environment

143
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.970 
at my own pace was effective. and seventy five percent said that

144
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.460 
they did not want him increasing synchronous lessons

145
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.750 
more on quality and quantity of communication and collaboration

146
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.830 
feedback on the performance task.
all of the students in satisfaction service said

147
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.680 
that feedback was timely and effective.

148
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.590 
and this was also supported in interviews.

149
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.270 
and like i said before example lesson plan template that was

150
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.720 
provided everyone was happy with that and that was supported

151
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.330 
almost everyone was happy and that was supported in the interviews

152
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.150 
pure evaluation for the performance task. so before they handed

153
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.840 
in they had to do period evaluation of the videos and lesson plan

154
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.030 
and overall students were happy with that as well,

155
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.750 
significance for career development thirty six out of forty

156
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.690 
students passed course. but all completed the marks

157
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.330 
to obtain their certificates and all interviews said they were

158
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.170 
motivated to get the certificate.

159
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:18.320 
and the students chose the mark themselves.
so that's also important to recognize here.

160
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.430 
eighty seven point five of the students indicated that

161
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.790 
the end of the course performance task was meaningful.

162
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.750 
and all of the interviewed students referred to how the course

163
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.540 
finish system their future produce in the interviews.

164
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.950 
so one of the students for example said i want to apply it

165
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.800 
in my own work and aim to be a teacher.

166
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.310 
and lastly suitability of the mooc paste learning not pacing learning in my

167
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.970 
suggested deadlines. so the students did not pace their learning

168
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.350 
would suggested that lines. but the deadlines were just suggestions.

169
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.930 
so the instructor realized that she actually has to

170
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.340 
integrate the deadlines into the lms and

171
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.750 
grate them to make sure that students are actually followed the course.

172
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:13.760 
because what we found out that there were students who didn't even register

173
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.860 
for the mooc until very later into the semester.
and they didn't pace their learning

174
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.960 
mooc's grading system for providing evidence of learning.

175
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.320 
so for example one of the students said at the end of the unit's

176
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:34.090 
referring to the mooc. there were tests which could be taken

177
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.910 
an infinite number of times. there's no risk of getting a bad

178
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.210 
grade. you could just get back to the videos needed to answer.

179
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.280 
yes so basically what she's saying is some moocs are more flexible.

180
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.470 
they don't they give you the right answer or they tell you

181
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.350 
the wrong answer.
so you can just go through them. this is you can take them

182
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.780 
amount of times in a short period of time some are more rigid.

183
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.310 
you can only take them quizzes,

184
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:06.560 
once or twice in a day or so depending on your mooc content.

185
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.390 
you have to make sure that

186
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.860 
evidence of learning is actually provided.

187
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.850 
so based on this data analysis we came up with this mooc based only on

188
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:25.270 
course suggestions themes and guiding questions for the themes.

189
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.520 
and this is specifically for i am

190
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.030 
for a micro credentials program.

191
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.830 
i would say the suggestions the guiding questions are intended

192
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.450 
for or intended for a course of that nature.

193
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.440 
so i'm just gonna leave this here for a brief. second so

194
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:10.150 
based on the results the flipped learning in education course was effective regarding.

195
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.410 
how our maybe i looked now thinking about it.

196
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.650 
i say effective maybe is a strong word to use here successful.

197
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:27.100 
maybe regarding student achievement or learning outcomes and satisfaction.

198
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.590 
there is room for improvement regarding engagement with my

199
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.750 
systems tools and materials

200
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.890 
which requires a lot of attention and effort when creating beams from

201
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.730 
moocs.
the teacher had to make a letter last groups
had to send a letter emails.

202
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:48.810 
and she didn't organize she didn't merge her lms and the mooc

203
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.570 
well together to pace learning. but all of those things require

204
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.330 
a lot of time and teacher presence. so we believe that such

205
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.560 
a course designed for universities can benefit their students'

206
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.970 
career development by integrating my credentials into the curriculum

207
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.090 
fostering learner choice and autonomy and bringing flexibility

208
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.210 
in delivering quality instruction in times of

209
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.540 
uncertainty like the pandemic that we just had

210
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:20.280 
references. and unfortunately we didn't have a weaknesses

211
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.150 
section. and that's one of the weaknesses over the paper i would say.

212
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:30.200 
and obviously other weaknesses are that the sampling both for

213
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.480 
the quantitative.
and the qualitative data gathering were voluntary it wasn't purposeful.

214
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.300 
yes and

215
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.570 
i was able to think about a lot more weaknesses.
but now i can't

216
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.220 
there are

217
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.140 
yeah i don't think more of or you have and you can ask questions.

218
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.060 
thank you now i'm a phd student again.

219
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.000 
i'm currently doing my piece in educational technology.

220
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.400 
thank you yeah, thank you very much. parker

221
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.200 
um either any questions.

222
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.250 
i can write him chad or yeah sebastian or

223
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:23.370 
was directly yeah thanks a lot for yer inspiring talk and the insights

224
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.170 
you presented throughout using a mooc in the flipped classroom concept.

225
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.780 
and i was a little surprised about the communication.

226
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.920 
you presented as part of your kind of research and especially that student groups

227
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.640 
formed the whatsapp group to

228
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.280 
discuss the content and that the other office you provided such as

229
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.530 
the virtual office hour or the chat within the course were not used.

230
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.980 
and do you have any kind of further explanation or insight

231
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:03.080 
on this.
and is this something you want to improve in the future or is it

232
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.940 
fine for you know the definitely.

233
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.640 
the main reason we looked at the official course was to

234
00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.850 
make better decisions. the next time we give these type of courses

235
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.320 
and it turned out to be a paper. but definitely

236
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.030 
we want to encourage students using those platforms. turkish

237
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.740 
students can be shy and they might not want to show

238
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.120 
their presence on a formal

239
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.800 
question board, or they might they can't.

240
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.350 
there is a hierarchy culture here as well and they might not feel comfort

241
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.430 
talking to the instructor live or set up an

242
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.810 
appointment that might be too scary for them.

243
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.610 
less scary if the instructor is

244
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.900 
international definitely, but still scary.

245
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.440 
so yeah those those might be the reasons.

246
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.970 
i'm wondering if making

247
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.590 
county form mandatory

248
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.830 
would be a solution and it might not be.

249
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.520 
because they might just prefer not asking the teacher now.

250
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.530 
and just stick to their friends

251
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:30.990 
that might be yes. so we need to think more on how we can take

252
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.670 
that workload off of the instructor and have students deal

253
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.340 
with those problems on their own, because the answers are there,

254
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.320 
how they're going to registered and so on.

255
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.170 
i was wondering whether some kind of other

256
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:51.000 
communication channel might be well-suited.
so as part of some courses

257
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.730 
i got to used to they kind of introduced a discourse channel.
for example

258
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.090 
i could server for their communication means and

259
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.490 
and provide a different channel for different assignment groups.

260
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.060 
for example and this one was well accepted by my students as

261
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:13.110 
it still had that live discussion feature and additional support

262
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.760 
for video conferences or screen training. so maybe that could

263
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.960 
be an attitude to look into in the future.

264
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.780 
no there's a really good suggestion in this cord is informal

265
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.060 
as well, and they use it for games those definitely feel more comfortable there.

266
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.500 
we will take that into consideration. thank you.

267
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.650 
further questions from the audience or suggestions for the course.

268
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.760 
yes that's very appreciated.

269
00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.750 
otherwise i use the meantime, because as you said this was a

270
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.210 
flipped learning scenario and a flipped online course you did with your students.

271
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.410 
it's not accessible wire external. so it's not

272
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.560 
open like the open definition and moocs. but you

273
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.420 
used the mook as a learning material. yes.

274
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:08.090 
yes and did you make a copy on your system or did you use the mooc on

275
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.510 
an open platform.

276
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.580 
so on an open platform the students were registered to the mooc.

277
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.760 
it's a massive course a lot of people take it there are discussion boards

278
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.690 
on the platform as well. but we just provided link links

279
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.770 
in each module to the mooc.

280
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.050 
this would go to the mooc.

281
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.170 
did you check if they used the discussion board there.

282
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:44.050 
you know it's a facebook integrated and the discussion, so many

283
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.340 
people have posted. we

284
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:51.110 
check for those too yeah because i wondered what i'd like the question

285
00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.280 
ready ready talk. yeah so so so they should have been talked.

286
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.260 
and when they didn't just talked and didn't talked on your

287
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.510 
discussion board and didn't talk.

288
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.140 
and didn't wish to have more synchronous sessions. and

289
00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.530 
so i also guess they did speak to each other. but where yeah

290
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.740 
yeah they said i mean the six and

291
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.910 
six students foreign students we interviewed said what's up yes

292
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.830 
okay are there further questions.

293
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.110 
i

294
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.730 
see no one typing nor rising hands no one speaking and thank

295
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.820 
you for your presentation.

296
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.760 
thank you for your attention.

297
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:47.000 
and then we were go ahead with your mid-career from the university of bang.

298
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:52.250 
a right now and he's presenting on his topic on who were the

299
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.220 
students from experiences from learning analytics clustering techniques.

300
00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.730 
so uh you have to be co- host yeah. i think so

301
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.840 
you have us here yes yes

302
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.800 
of course because um well

303
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.250 
okay i play if i have two seconds or three seconds.

304
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.020 
my mike is but for

305
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.530 
now can you see my screen.

306
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.120 
yes i was just just a matter

307
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.980 
of how how much time i have thirty minutes if you have thirty

308
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.090 
minutes in total oh yeah

309
00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.400 
okay.

310
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.860 
thank you very much

311
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.820 
for being here. so today i'm presenting who are these students

312
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.700 
supports experience from learning and analytics

313
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:19.380 
techniques. i'm clean i'm currently working at universal bergen

314
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.510 
and you're presenting this

315
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.310 
experience paper.

316
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.460 
so yeah i'm just like i thought i should bring this after i

317
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.270 
said oh you know. and so i just

318
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.730 
took this photo. so at the moment i we are here in bergen bergen

319
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.710 
is the second largest city after oslo so yeah.

320
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.080 
yeah i always like to bring this picture is not as sunny as

321
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.350 
what we always think like that. for bergen is one of the

322
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.160 
rainiest cities in the

323
00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.150 
norway i think maybe in europe. so it rains two hundred sixty days.

324
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.650 
but luckily this week and maybe in summer we are having a couple of sunny days.

325
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.300 
so yeah pretty depressing, but

326
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.460 
we are trying to enjoy all these sunny days.

327
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:16.520 
ok so yeah if i want to start like.

328
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.890 
i like very much the term digital exhaust, so

329
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:28.310 
when students use moocs or learning machine systems or a digital online learning systems.

330
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:34.210 
they leave footprints behind them and a user's will they leave that behind.

331
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.980 
this is what maybe can be called digital exhaust which refers to

332
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.260 
the data trail we leave behind as we wander through the internet.

333
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:48.970 
it's like an example evoking a nice visual parallel of a vehicle

334
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:54.280 
leaving a visual trail of exhaust. and recently there is more

335
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.010 
and more talk about something called identification and identification

336
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.970 
is a technological trend

337
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:05.110 
turning many aspects or aspects of lives into data which is

338
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.920 
subsequently transferred into information realised as a new form of value.

339
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.280 
and this is actually very important and very well connected

340
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.830 
to learning analytics. and learning analytics is for people

341
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:21.260 
who don't know it as the use of data about students and their

342
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.460 
activities to enhance education.
so it's a field that the emerged in

343
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.770 
twenty eleven and it has

344
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.760 
has been evolving and emerging.

345
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.680 
it's not yet very much mature.
but it is a very important field at the moment

346
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.180 
and i will show that in the next that is life.

347
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.020 
so like if we get an example of right now. many institutions

348
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.140 
are now collecting a huge amount of data more consistent

349
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.900 
and in a way that can be you know maybe the data can be merged with other datasets

350
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.810 
in greater and greater insight on the effectiveness of educational process.

351
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.910 
but now with the code nineteen and the major movement

352
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:05.760 
of learning and teaching to one digital education we see like all

353
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.850 
we think that data is now much much more available than before.

354
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.660 
and special about students and how institutions could use that and

355
00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.590 
there i presented another paper at another conference is that

356
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:24.510 
where we found that maybe the time now to do learning analytics

357
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.340 
is much better than before. because the availability of the

358
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.390 
data is there. but of course with challenges like especially

359
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.360 
with privacy and and ethical constraints.

360
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.810 
yeah and then there is this a very

361
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:41.180 
important every board. it's like annual report comes every year

362
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.590 
and twenty twenty-one. because writes report

363
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.640 
they try to do c or like two the most important fields at the

364
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.880 
current moment and like the trend in the next three four years.

365
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.980 
and of course learning a lot of it is there as well as the

366
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.390 
third part. and then i thought what a factor said micro-prudential

367
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:04.460 
is also very important number four here. and also we have a i'm sure

368
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.550 
there's no doubt about how important is that

369
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.890 
and also yeah we have

370
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.960 
quality online learning.

371
00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.710 
so back to that back to the title and the focus on the classroom

372
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.890 
why actually we need to start clustering more like know about it.

373
00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.750 
so like yesterday when i was information like this

374
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.790 
argument by lillian person she says that the purpose of clustering.

375
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.750 
and classification algorithms is to make sense

376
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.110 
of and extract values from large datasets okay of structured and unstructured data.

377
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.250 
so if we are working with huge volumes of unstructured data.

378
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.410 
it only makes sense to try to partition the data in some sort

379
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.570 
of logical grouping for attempting to realize a

380
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.910 
clustering in an education is important into identifying

381
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.300 
groups of objects in order to find linked patterns of correlations

382
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.660 
in educational data sense. so for example

383
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.550 
looks like when you have, let's say a hundred students and you

384
00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.910 
have a lot of engagement patterns. so yeah you need to classify somehow

385
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.180 
these patterns and group them together in order to identify

386
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.240 
some kind of grouping according to your needs or according

387
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.130 
to objectives that you are looking for.

388
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.280 
as where is the intersection between clustering learning analytics and looks.

389
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.670 
and i found out that

390
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:27.160 
clustering appears as one of the learning analytics methods

391
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.640 
for carrying out analysis.

392
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.730 
this is for example or that's for example researchers can assess how closer.

393
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:39.320 
sets explain meaning of data and like i looked at couple of papers and

394
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.960 
of course our clustering is one of the methods for learning and

395
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.600 
nice of course

396
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.890 
monopolize for that, but it also for like for data

397
00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:55.090 
mining and machine learning and yeah learning with this is of course

398
00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.240 
very strongly related to that.

399
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.160 
so that was like a little bit of introduction about the clustering.

400
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.950 
and why it's important and a now for my current study that y

401
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.720 
y it's the experience because a we got a project called there

402
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.690 
what is better than what m what is

403
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.910 
the project was bitter learning experience. but then here i'm just

404
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.250 
losing a little bit so we were approached by university of oslo

405
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:31.970 
metropolitan from oslo. and they had a corresponding ethics

406
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:36.390 
and any approaches to say ok we want to follow the trend of learning

407
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.890 
something ok what exactly need them.

408
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.250 
so they got a couple of courses and they wanted to look at

409
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:50.250 
and just get some analysis.
and of course yeah we offered them kind of like

410
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.700 
heatmaps. or

411
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.440 
they're like students and engagement and looking at the videos

412
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.100 
descriptive and other things you know. and the

413
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.690 
general how many times they're videos were played and it's a drum

414
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.670 
and then the next step was to offer them feedback and then

415
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:09.750 
the feedback was like

416
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.560 
based on the

417
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.920 
data that we provided the teacher could

418
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:21.730 
for instance send an email for example hear myself saying that

419
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.510 
you have been away for a long time.
and that the message would

420
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.040 
be personalized very much. so the student doesn't feel he's isolated.

421
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.600 
so he feels that or she feels that the teacher is following

422
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.640 
and trying to home

423
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.000 
in every moment. and then

424
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.280 
the idea is you're for the clusterings that we've got like some

425
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.380 
requests is that saying okay i get the course. but

426
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:52.940 
for my course i want to i want to give more weight to my videos.

427
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.950 
i want my teacher i know i want my students or i want to see

428
00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.140 
or who are my students looking at the videos. and i want to

429
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.070 
get higher like a highway to that.

430
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:06.630 
so we were thinking ok the best thing is to do is

431
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:10.010 
to make clustering a lite look at clustering and then

432
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.390 
we can make it personalized. so the

433
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.390 
teacher can give away okay i want seventy five percent of the

434
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.390 
way to go to the videos and twenty percent to go to the discussion forums.

435
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:27.390 
and then i can get the list of my students ok who are the highest engaged students

436
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.780 
or if i have an important example important

437
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.530 
assignments. i'll give it seventy percent and the videos thirty percent

438
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.820 
and then all the groups chance.

439
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:42.220 
and so before reaching to this point we looked at

440
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.560 
papers from google scholar. and then

441
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.280 
at the literature and this and this literature when we search

442
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.470 
we wanted to look at studies that focus on engagement.

443
00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.050 
and because this is what is most important for clustering and

444
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.760 
in getting a look at engagement of the students.

445
00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.230 
and then the second thing as these studies showed was whitehorse

446
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.260 
based on degree of engagement civil engaged engaged or engaged.

447
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.320 
and the third thing is to

448
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.700 
of course this paper should have moves as part of it and learning another keyword,

449
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.210 
because if you want to search learning another if you

450
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.960 
want search clustering you will get a lot of

451
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.740 
studies and then we looked at the five most appearing papers here, because young

452
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:33.290 
just like to get a good overview and we found like these papers.

453
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.930 
one of them included one of my old studies i want to be as yeah founded.

454
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:45.180 
and then after that we we got these four papers or these my papers

455
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.730 
and then we tried to

456
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.890 
analyze them and look at them and so we looked at

457
00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.470 
these four areas

458
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:05.410 
why they why did the clustering and the second what are the

459
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:10.280 
methods used for clustering and then number three is
what variables to use

460
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:15.320 
from the move to the clustering and finally
what are the clusters they count

461
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.130 
the researchers. ok now look at the first thing.

462
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.260 
so yeah i'll just go with that from the beverly hills much easier.

463
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.870 
so i'll have that okay what are the reasons for using the cluster

464
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.440 
in moocs. and then the papers like

465
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.080 
newspaper one of the most cited one they wanted to look at

466
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.320 
they wanted to characterize learning engagement that was

467
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:41.980 
one of the major forgoing that logic and second they want to define learning

468
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.660 
tradition trajectories of engagement and analyze learning behavior.

469
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.630 
i'm not sure studies like looked into investigating engagement create engagement profile.

470
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.170 
so they want to created profiles of both of the student and

471
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.090 
of course considering discussion and assessment the third they

472
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.160 
want to discover characteristics of student profile and portray engagement

473
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:03.070 
and as

474
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.750 
the fourth paper they look at understanding
students' engagement in mooc

475
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.220 
for insight what keeps the students engaged. so they want to

476
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.610 
move the students brought into that.

477
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.930 
and finally it's the last ever they want to explore learning

478
00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:19.590 
behavior characteristics and combine learner behavior data

479
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.310 
with clustering algorithms to group learners into homogeneous groups.

480
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.320 
so as you see here alike all these reasons were used by these five members.

481
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.440 
two for doing

482
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.670 
the clustering and their sense

483
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.800 
is also interesting part of it is what are

484
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.000 
the most common and used

485
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.760 
was the kings and also we

486
00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.020 
clustering can also be validated. so

487
00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.810 
we looked at if the papers look at the

488
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.060 
they validated them there their

489
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.550 
sort the number of orders or the number of clusters.

490
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.900 
they found in the papers because you could get twenty

491
00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.410 
clusters and that maybe don't make sense.

492
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.930 
you need to get into a smaller group of clusters.
but they have to make sense.

493
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:20.610 
so that every or all the students inside every group should

494
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.610 
make sense with the others.

495
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.780 
so we found that only the study's validated outcome

496
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.150 
validation clustering and engagement can show the number of

497
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.890 
cluster a students and just like give a

498
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:36.310 
generalization of that. so we found like the first paper custom

499
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:41.440 
logistic distribution k-means the others beginning as companies that

500
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:47.190 
use hierarchical and k-means. and it looks like many of them just use

501
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.320 
king's fluttering and that's of course a as in people learning.

502
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:55.410 
so there is a good potential a gap to use

503
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.690 
or a space to use other techniques in them

504
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.610 
from machine learning and clustering find

505
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.230 
other interesting groups

506
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.040 
disturbances that what the researcher used to do the clustering.

507
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.470 
and we found like the first study to use

508
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:20.110 
mainly the course video lectures and assessment assessment

509
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.410 
assignments. and over the video

510
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.240 
variables there the second study they looked at the course

511
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.990 
visits how many times the look in

512
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.020 
the form boss and the assessment submission.

513
00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:38.850 
the third study they looked at the discussion forums reading and writing

514
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.660 
as well as self assessment and video watched.

515
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:46.140 
the fourth study they looked at again information watching lecture videos

516
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.410 
submitting assignments and bottom discussion forums.

517
00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:54.280 
the fifth study they looked at discussion form was discussion form replies

518
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:58.510 
and final scores and total duration was reveals and number of videos viewed.

519
00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.420 
so every study might look at these variables in order to do the clustering.

520
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:09.400 
so that was the variables that they used to make the clustering things.

521
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.070 
and the fourth

522
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.430 
area which was a bit also

523
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.650 
not easy to do,

524
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.450 
because i got thirty thirty thirty types

525
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.930 
of sometimes, because i remember my

526
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.040 
my favorite titles who are the ceilings.

527
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.920 
and so every research r gave a name for every student type.

528
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.880 
okay and the result was that we got thirty categories, so if

529
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.860 
you look at the cluster in the middle you find that some of

530
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.440 
the researchers named their students as computers the others named

531
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.660 
them as some other auditors dropped out

532
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:55.880 
behind this engagement outside. or outside of the course on

533
00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.120 
the track of the course gaming the system students wore gaming the system

534
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.710 
social students. we couldn't at the self

535
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:08.630 
conscious short term to find all these searchers to find everyone

536
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.990 
is giving just a name for the groups they found inside their

537
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:15.620 
courses from the moocs. and so okay and then after that

538
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.110 
i tried to from all these studies of course some of these overlap with the others

539
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:26.480 
like for instance many of them named drop out as one common very common

540
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.530 
cluster to be shared with the others. and i found like four

541
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.760 
papers says that there are completed sandler's we find three

542
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.460 
studies or the thing you have to throw out is to actually add,

543
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.310 
and then everyone is giving just a different thing.

544
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.470 
and then based on the feedback that i got on the paper and

545
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:50.150 
someone said one of the reviewers said that can you also get grouped this

546
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:55.580 
clusters into clusters. and then said yes of course that

547
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.610 
may be a nice idea, and then i tried to put them into three

548
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.230 
main themes that for one. the first one is commitment and commitment

549
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.080 
incorporate priorities that want to engagement of dropping

550
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.430 
out or completing. and i found seventy types of that so completing sandler's. and the

551
00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.960 
drop out behind this engaging. all these refer to

552
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.430 
referred to the commitment in

553
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.710 
the second theme as the motivation. and that is

554
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.420 
anything that like gaming the system is part of the motivation some students get

555
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.610 
too much just to get

556
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.230 
the grade and without caring for getting the knowledge.

557
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:37.210 
the other can just to chat or just make friendship

558
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.930 
or like to find common

559
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.500 
and and shared interests for instance. and that's a part of the motivation

560
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.230 
and then the third thing is a chronology and the students by

561
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.950 
whom their engagement is defined within a timeframe. and we

562
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:54.360 
found six types of the

563
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.940 
clusters there. and we put them into that theme.

564
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.340 
so yeah so take away

565
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.530 
away the messages from our studies. so there is actually

566
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.560 
a positive correlation to engagement. and

567
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.850 
so the failure showed that active engagement

568
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.050 
through fulfilling moocs assignment and thus are associated to increased

569
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.310 
publish rate. so high engagement heart rate and

570
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.810 
or most of the papers in

571
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.900 
the second studies that sort of the second message that cohorts.

572
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.750 
and clustering are made subjective to the authors and study

573
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.100 
objectives and other showed.

574
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:41.310 
we have thirty thirty clusters and every research given in

575
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:42.910 
drop out giving the system.

576
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:48.180 
a social whatever some others say very students others say completed.

577
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:55.140 
so every every research just give a name to the cluster according

578
00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:59.700 
to the data available or the data collection or the objective

579
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.330 
of their study.

580
00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:06.210 
the third take away message is the lack of learning series

581
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.390 
that is that i couldn't ok they used computer science they

582
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.840 
use machine learning in order to come up with clusters.

583
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:16.010 
but we have to remember that learning is about learning.

584
00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:21.430 
it's not about only doing machine learning into educational businesses.

585
00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:27.880 
but i think it can be a there might be more potential when we for instance link

586
00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.620 
these clustering or these clustering

587
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:35.370 
results with learning signals that we think of, for example

588
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.980 
learning whether we can cluster groups of students according

589
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.240 
to the circulated learning three main stages.

590
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.890 
this is just an example where we have other other theories like

591
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.630 
constructivism connected

592
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.290 
and the other. so i think

593
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.360 
there is a good potential to do

594
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:58.830 
a link at this cluster of techniques with learning theories.

595
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.680 
the final message is that

596
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:07.820 
actually learning analytics is about optimizing learning at the end.

597
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:13.610 
and where student clustering actually has not yet been used

598
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.540 
to optimize student learning. so we found that it only used

599
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.740 
to analyze and stop there. so there is no any kind of closing the loop

600
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.480 
and try to improve learning at the end. so we just like clustering

601
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:31.790 
and maybe maybe as some messages to the students in order to do an intervention

602
00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.240 
that could be an extent.

603
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.120 
but that i couldn't find very much

604
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.140 
in the paper. it's actually

605
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.160 
north of that  last paper that i did from these five were

606
00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.490 
two thousand and eighteen. so there might be other papers like

607
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:52.120 
twenty nineteen or twenty twenty that somehow

608
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.430 
highlight that issue

609
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:59.260 
and also like the papers reviewed where nearly a extreme dependent

610
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.610 
that is blushing is focused on exploring and explaining learning behavior from

611
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.670 
different approaches. so as i said i believe there is a gap

612
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.930 
in learning traces of students learning behavior

613
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:13.930 
and moves and actual learning processes.

614
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.920 
yes so that's it for my son.

615
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.810 
thank you very much murmured

616
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.550 
are there any question yet even as raised.

617
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.810 
i thank you muhammad for the interesting presentation. so i have

618
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:34.290 
a question more related to the data the main pain points to

619
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.550 
experience a extracting the data cleaning refining the data.

620
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.990 
if you can elaborate a little bit more about that.

621
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:48.500 
i'm so are you asking about like cleaning the data and

622
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.500 
refining the data in order to do the clustering,

623
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:55.820 
yes before before applying the technique yes all of the process

624
00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.880 
related to cleaning data refining data. i'm also interested in your

625
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:05.120 
how you get access to these data how you elaborate the data,

626
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.420 
before you apply the technique. yes

627
00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:13.220 
yeah thank you as i said. this is like this we looked at papers

628
00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:18.050 
that did the clustering ok so. but one of them is one of this

629
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:21.340 
is the election library. so it actually needs a lot of time

630
00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:25.500 
to clean the data group the data and you know is that like

631
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.650 
in most especially like in open ethics.
we get the data of jason files jason lines.

632
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:35.390 
it's a very complicated form of data. so you need to green try to

633
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:40.810 
link every learning interaction or learning activity or like

634
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.740 
without the word learning every activity with every student.

635
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.180 
so for instance eve our mohammed has

636
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.300 
one thousand two thousand activities, and then you time framed

637
00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.100 
every activity according to that.

638
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:57.440 
and then after that ok you get a group of active dispur where

639
00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.150 
by person. and then clean up

640
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.170 
any data you won't need like id addresses or or personal information.

641
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:08.010 
and then after that you can group the and make the clustering

642
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:12.190 
based on what you actually look at what you actually need.

643
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.550 
so as i showed from the studies like if you want to look at engagement

644
00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:17.850 
or learning behavior okay, then i want to see

645
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:22.720 
how many times they look at my videos, and then ok then i will take

646
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.670 
specifically the data from videos like am

647
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:31.410 
watching the follow with your posts in the video or watching

648
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.210 
part of the videos. then you can maybe start link with that.

649
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.710 
so just need to code what you really want in order to do the

650
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.390 
clustering according to your needs.

651
00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.990 
further questions this was a very good one i had also had it

652
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.100 
on my list.

653
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.180 
how they would data where from  edits and what did you used

654
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.960 
for yourself and tools and yeah.

655
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.250 
ok maybe one question i asked myself during talk.

656
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.530 
but you a little bit answered at at the end.

657
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.840 
how do you rate the activity clustering

658
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:18.540 
towards the qualitative. a

659
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:22.830 
view on the students are you said

660
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.530 
when they are active in a course a they melli a completed course yeah.

661
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.990 
but are there also some

662
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.470 
students that worked very different, it they were

663
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.180 
not active in a course. but did a

664
00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.300 
complete completion very well. yeah yeah so

665
00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.210 
you know that like the learning analytics

666
00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.810 
depends on quantitative data so we just follow what the students do

667
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.520 
of course. there might be

668
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.390 
a lot of things happening outside the

669
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:05.010 
actual platform. right so like as an example some people might

670
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:09.390 
or some students might be chatting or or or communicating on whatsapp or

671
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:14.110 
something. and this is of course unreachable for us right like like

672
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:17.840 
for the data or or to do the learning.

673
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.720 
but the correlation between a higher engagement like

674
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:28.360 
attending the courses watching the videos. and sippra is

675
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.330 
strongly correlated with completing the courses.

676
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.920 
but we don't know if the students are actually. there to get the

677
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.330 
knowledge or to get a grade or to get a certificate.

678
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.060 
we have no idea about this. right so

679
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:48.190 
i think a qualitative approach like this approach between quantitative and qualitative is

680
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.930 
a good approach that we can follow in order to see

681
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:57.790 
what else is happening behind a learning analytic state. and see

682
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:03.240 
if really engagement with the whatever interactions in the platform

683
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.810 
is the reason for the higher engagement. and completion

684
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:13.730 
of course only on statistics and if some correlations in terms execrations.

685
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.370 
yes i has a question

686
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.430 
thank you for the presentation.

687
00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:28.670 
one of your take away messages was that the learning analytics

688
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.020 
has not yet been used

689
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.320 
to optimize learning.

690
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:39.220 
and although
i'm a bit uncomfortable with the term to optimize learning.

691
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:43.770 
i mean i'm not really sure it has a clear meaning

692
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:46.720 
or at least in my head that is

693
00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.930 
i would love to hear your thoughts about

694
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.090 
the ways that you think.

695
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.730 
learning analytics can be used

696
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.500 
in order to improve the learning

697
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.020 
is actually what i said it's not about learning. i said the

698
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.180 
clustering has not been used of learning, because clustering

699
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.460 
as part of learning analytics methods.

700
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.170 
but i do understand well

701
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.460 
the official definition of learning analysis

702
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:22.050 
from well as well. twenty twelve has not changed and it is the

703
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:26.050 
sense in optimize the learning experience smart optimized learning.

704
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.590 
so there might be a big difference between optimized learning

705
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.240 
and optimized learning experience. right so

706
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.420 
yeah so i think i think i think

707
00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:42.970 
if we want to predict students like at risk help the

708
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:48.080 
students who are suffering into for whatever reason inside this

709
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:53.100 
platform. so maybe learning analysis could optimize but of course

710
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.990 
it's not guaranteed nothing is guaranteed.

711
00:50:56.410 --> 00:51:00.590 
because there is something called intrinsic motivation of the

712
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:04.130 
students that we cannot reach easily. right so the students

713
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.430 
should be motivated by themselves. the i need the knowledge

714
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:11.450 
i want to do that and then you can see a complete different behavior

715
00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.750 
than students who just like find an open course and want to

716
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.470 
get the specific knowledge and go out. so based on that you

717
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:25.580 
can see a complete change of defining completion ratio or like define complete

718
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.960 
learning or knowledge, because i could like

719
00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:33.850 
define am as soon as you completed, because i want to know the

720
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.910 
specific information for my mooc.
but i don't have to finish the move right.

721
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.130 
so i'm getting only that specific information. so

722
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.810 
this is kind of motivational and intrinsic

723
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:48.000 
incentive for why students are attending these moocs

724
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:53.260 
or like these online courses. so yeah but at least

725
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:57.660 
learning less could help like with increasing engagement like

726
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:02.200 
for instance giving feedback according to your behavior or like

727
00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:07.580 
as showing you as a student in convergent with other peers.

728
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:11.170 
like how the others are doing and you are doing. so if you are

729
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:16.130 
like low or behind or below the threshold we could send you

730
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:20.700 
a message. we could link you with another peer or correct you

731
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.840 
on the learning path. so kind of learning of this could help

732
00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:27.200 
i think but of course is not guaranteed to optimize the learning space

733
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.010 
ok are there further questions. you can also

734
00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:38.990 
open your mic and speak

735
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.310 
for if it is not

736
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:54.090 
we think a more hard for the presentation

737
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.040 
and hand over to if i am

738
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:04.060 
into and laura i guess laura is not here are the other two

739
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.170 
authors. i sorry to list

740
00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:13.090 
and uh i give the chance to introduce you a little bit.
and then we start

741
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.160 
the video and have a discussion

742
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:19.380 
afterwards you can always put there the questions

743
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.660 
in a chat or pose your questions

744
00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:26.260 
after the video. so my name is eva ponce i'm the executive director

745
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.390 
of the mit x the micromasters program in supply chain management

746
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:36.730 
at mit bay center for transportation logistics a research scientist

747
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.580 
at this center. i'm leading the researching omnichannel

748
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.960 
omnichannel distribution strategies on circular supply chain.

749
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.300 
so thank you so much for the opportunity and happy to share

750
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.670 
with you more about what we learn including community teaching

751
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:58.910 
assistance as part of our program.
and as part of our mch courses thank you.

752
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.250 
hi everyone i hope everyone can hear me.

753
00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:09.020 
i'm cindy and i'm working as a course leader with the

754
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:13.030 
mit x micromasters program teaching supply chain analytic scores.

755
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:17.560 
and the comprehensive final exam i'm also working as a research assistant

756
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.690 
at the mit omnichannel education lab.

757
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:25.510 
i welcome everyone to this session. we are going to discuss

758
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:30.000 
about how to integrate community teaching a system in massive

759
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.740 
open and online courses. so my name is eva ponce. i'm the executive

760
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.180 
director of the mit x the micromasters program in supply chain management.

761
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:44.670 
the co-authors of this paper are cindy sheena a laura.

762
00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.220 
both of them are course lead as part of the micromasters team.

763
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:53.390 
and they are also researchers as part of the mit omnichannel

764
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:58.580 
education lab that we are running at mit the center for transportation and logistics.

765
00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:04.210 
so let me start with an overview of the program. so the micromasters

766
00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.760 
in supply chain management is a program that

767
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:13.540 
we design in order to democratised knowledge the program includes

768
00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:18.790 
five massive open online courses all of them about supply chain.

769
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.920 
we start talking about supply chain analytics. then we move

770
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.790 
into supply chain fundamental supply chain design supply chain

771
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:29.720 
dynamics and technology and systems at the end of the program.

772
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:34.680 
we provide a comprehensive and final and proctor exam we are

773
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.780 
doing that in order to ensure academic integrity and in order

774
00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.650 
to add value to the credential

775
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:46.140 
our program includes two type of learners we have audit learners.

776
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.030 
and this is because our mission is to educate the world for free.

777
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:54.720 
so these are learners that they just need to enrolling our program

778
00:55:54.930 --> 00:56:00.070 
and they don't need to pay any fee. we also have verified learners

779
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:04.270 
these are learners that they need to pay a modest fee in order

780
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.110 
to pursue for a certificate in our program.

781
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.770 
our goals is to provide the best learning experience to our learners

782
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:16.190 
to encourage learners through interaction and also to inject

783
00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:21.060 
positive energy. and b courtesy and trying to answer our learners

784
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.260 
question and help them as much as we can through the learning process

785
00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.570 
in terms of the problem.
we are talking here we are facing with these paper

786
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:37.120 
in our courses we have an average between ten thousand to thirty thousand learners.

787
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.300 
this includes all type of learners audited and verified in

788
00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.790 
terms of the course staff we a have one course lead this is

789
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:50.080 
the person who is co-ordinating the course. and we also have

790
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.540 
one mit teaching a system helping to run the course through

791
00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:57.670 
the email accounts through the discussion forum and helping

792
00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:01.780 
our learners to solve their questions. but as you can see here,

793
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:04.810 
there is a huge gap in between the number of learners that

794
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:09.450 
we have and the staff that we allocate in order to run these courses.

795
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:15.330 
so that is what we other authors also called teacher bandwith issue.

796
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:20.990 
so what we did here is to integrate community teaching a system.

797
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:25.080 
these are volunteers. volunteers across the world these are

798
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.600 
learners that have already completed with us one or three or

799
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:33.980 
some courses or our program and they are volunteers to contribute

800
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:38.540 
to our courses helping us to moderate the photons and helping

801
00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:43.860 
us to help our learners through these massive open and online courses

802
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:52.460 
the methodology that we followed for our project over ninety

803
00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.700 
five percent of the cities recruited for a particular run have

804
00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.150 
already taken the course before as learners themselves. so as

805
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:04.870 
such that basic demographic details like nationality age education background

806
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:10.020 
are already available to us as part of initial signup survey conducted by ethics.

807
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:13.550 
so we use the survey results to create general insights on

808
00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:17.390 
the profile of cities to know more about the motivation behind

809
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:20.790 
volunteering for the role the benefits that they seek and the

810
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:24.090 
challenges that they face and other details. we conducted an

811
00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:27.970 
anonymous survey among our cities. so it included multiple choice

812
00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:31.950 
questions and open ended questions and ranking options. so finally

813
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.250 
we considered the course leads insights to put together the

814
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:39.520 
processes for city recruitment training engagement defining

815
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.060 
the tasks and responsibilities. so let's next see the profile of the cities.

816
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.280 
so the mit micro masters and supply chain management is a global program

817
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:54.280 
and so naturally our cities come from different cultural and geographical backgrounds too.

818
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:58.510 
so from two thousand and sixteen to jan twenty twenty-one our

819
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.070 
program has love with one hundred and seventy nine cities from

820
00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:05.910 
forty nine countries across six continents. so at any point

821
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:10.530 
in the year there are more than sixty engaged in total across our courses

822
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:17.320 
to the demographics. now a higher percentage of our cities have a bachelor's degree

823
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:20.810 
while some of them have an additional master's degree. a small

824
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:24.020 
portion of our group also had just a high school degree when

825
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.660 
they  boarded with us a big part of our city group belongs

826
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.590 
to the age group of twenty four to twenty nine years with a

827
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:34.390 
very close following by those belonging to twenty nine to thirty nine.

828
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.240 
and this trend follows that of our learners as well

829
00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:43.850 
to next to the motivation challenges and benefits.

830
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:48.350 
so this was one of the insights that we gathered from the anonymous experience

831
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.950 
survey that we conducted it was really heartening for us to

832
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.860 
see that the first and foremost reason that the cities

833
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:59.110 
were motivated to volunteer for the sol was to give back to the community.

834
00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:02.710 
so being former learners themselves the cities have seen the

835
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:05.470 
value in community learning and the positive

836
01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:10.080 
impact that the teaching role can have in deeper understanding of concepts.

837
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:13.860 
so other important reasons which motivated the cities to volunteer

838
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:17.010 
was to stay connected to the staff and thus the program and

839
01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.270 
also learn from each other's perspectives.

840
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:25.110 
so next benefit the biggest benefit which was observed by rcts

841
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.300 
was in building a network with like-minded individuals

842
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:32.020 
followed by staying connected with the course content learning

843
01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.390 
new concepts as introduced time to time in the courses. and

844
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:38.740 
a single challenge which was almost agreed upon by all of our

845
01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:43.220 
cvs was finding a balance between the regular job volunteering

846
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:45.850 
for this role as well as spending time with the family

847
01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:53.420 
moving on to the recruitment process.
we have two types of recruitment process

848
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:58.690 
for the fresh candidates we circulate a google form at the

849
01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:01.750 
end of the course. one for interested candidates to apply

850
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.140 
coarsely then filters for their particular course done. and

851
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.780 
then selects the candidates based on the scores and their motivation statement.

852
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:14.180 
an invite is then sent to the selected candidates to confirm

853
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.660 
their approval. so this is a google form which shows the example

854
01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:22.120 
of how we follow this process another part is for the existing

855
01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.030 
candidates. and once a city and those are community they continue

856
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:30.900 
to keep in touch with the staff. and so the cities work performed well and also

857
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:34.890 
get recommendations from other course needs as well and the

858
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.570 
based on the performance and engagement in the previous course.

859
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:42.490 
we extend the invites to the existing cities as well. so this is

860
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.440 
at the bottom of the screen is a snapshot of the feedback form that we meet

861
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.470 
to evaluate our cities after the course run which is helpful

862
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:53.210 
for us in selecting among the existing candidates

863
01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:58.470 
up to this point. we share a little bit of why cities are super

864
01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:01.910 
important to our community what drives them to volunteer and

865
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:06.210 
how we select them lets you know a little bit more about their city and journey.

866
01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.630 
how we engage with them. and how we work together

867
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:13.430 
though as you mention we have a spur today hundred and seventy nine cities.

868
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.890 
and you can also see in the graph how much our community has

869
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:20.890 
grown since we started incorporating city eight back in two thousand and sixteen

870
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:24.330 
most of them stay with us between one and three course runs.

871
01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:26.980 
but you can also see they stay with us as much as they are

872
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.020 
willing to do it and even the site to stay much longer than that.

873
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:35.330 
we also keep track on their micromasters status, when they join

874
01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:39.270 
to our c taste him most of them start after completing one

875
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.980 
or two courses. but we also have many cities that decided to

876
01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.190 
join us once they finished their r program.

877
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.070 
that's also align with the importance that giving back to the

878
01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.350 
community has for all our learners as we've mentioned before.

879
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:56.140 
and it's awesome also to see that they invest our own six hours

880
01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.970 
a week to volunteer to the program.

881
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.480 
next we will show how the training process is fundamental for

882
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.280 
the city is to be the bridge between learners and corso

883
01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.130 
everything we shared is of course our mission everything we do

884
01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.810 
and everything we answer is always along to it. so we set the

885
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:17.280 
expectation we prioritize tasks and we differentiate learning from assessment

886
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.230 
also explaining our cities that we don't just share solutions.

887
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.800 
but we do guide learners through the learning process.

888
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:28.210 
we also establish a single platform for direct communication

889
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.650 
where cities can always find a staff member to share any questions

890
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:33.830 
feedback material or concerns.

891
01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:38.170 
we will next move to tasks and responsibilities.

892
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:43.530 
our city s main task is of course to engage with learners in the discussion forums.

893
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:47.610 
they also have to report honor code violation and of course

894
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:51.820 
box in the platform. everything we all do as teams aims to ensure

895
01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.970 
the best learning experience for everyone.

896
01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.680 
a subset of cities that our credential holders might have access

897
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.940 
to better test some of our problems in advance.

898
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.340 
and also everyone can bring projects to help us improve our courses.

899
01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.620 
finally this all bring us to the engagement process.

900
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:13.520 
our weekly meetings of less than an hour will be the moment

901
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.610 
of providing updates to the cities on the course titles

902
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.820 
where the deejays will share feedback on their experience and

903
01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.140 
that experience could be with the content with the platform

904
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:24.260 
or with the learners.

905
01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:29.490 
also we all share ideas for course improvement they engage

906
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:34.030 
in additional activities and for example they can propose discussion for materials.

907
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.710 
they are also allowed and invited of course to attend events

908
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:41.220 
or bring some on any solutions. they think of

909
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.430 
to our learners most frequently asked questions.

910
01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:49.250 
overall our entire team from direct source of the program to the ts

911
01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:53.240 
acknowledging every opportunity conference or platform they have access to.

912
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:55.870 
the added value from the cts to the community

913
01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:03.460 
an know let me and reward process is a very key part of this

914
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:07.240 
engagement process with our community to teaching assistance.

915
01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:10.600 
one of the things we are doing at the end of the course is

916
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.370 
evaluating their level of engagement with our learners and with the staff.

917
01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.820 
based on that evaluation we wore a certificate of excellence.

918
01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.250 
and the purpose of that is to recognize all of their contributions

919
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.930 
and the efforts to help us to conduct to manage these courses

920
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:33.920 
and to provide a high touch experience through our program to our

921
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:39.300 
learners we want also to thank them by name recognize in our

922
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.460 
newsletter. we sometimes pause our linking caples just say thank

923
01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.040 
you for your excellent work.

924
01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:52.300 
also we conduct a once per year with the directors of the program

925
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:56.900 
a city appreciation event. so we're trying our best in order

926
01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.300 
to recognize the efforts in terms of the lessons learned and

927
01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:06.200 
our recommendations if you are planning to incorporate community teaching a system

928
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.590 
in your courses. first of all

929
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:14.060 
we believe that is very important to make city a's to feel

930
01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:18.680 
special and valued for their contributions to the program. we

931
01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:23.620 
put some effort and the course team are putting a lot of effort in order to

932
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:28.470 
share updates with our city s and keep them informed about

933
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.250 
the progress of the course. we also pay a special attention

934
01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:36.330 
to listen to them we have a very value and experienced city

935
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:39.790 
aide they are professionals and they are bringing their experience

936
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:42.930 
the knowledge to our programs. so we need to recognize that

937
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.010 
we actively take their feedback they feel that their feedback

938
01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.950 
is very important for us and based on that we are improving

939
01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:56.640 
our courses every single time that we are running a new class for our courses.

940
01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.940 
we try also to support back our cities in the discussion forum and also

941
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.520 
we are available for them through

942
01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:09.870 
slack or email in order to answer any questions or concerns

943
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:14.450 
that they might have. so i believe that all of these a four

944
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:18.310 
contribute to the to have them engage with our program

945
01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:25.180 
in terms of the next step of this paper.
we are planning to include cts interviews

946
01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.410 
to better understand their motivation and to foster engagement

947
01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:33.380 
practices accordingly true to that. second thing we are planning

948
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.040 
to do is to further expand on a staff and learners feedback

949
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:43.100 
regarding the impact of cts in order to create these a learning

950
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:47.920 
journey that we want to create through these courses. so in conclusion

951
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:53.170 
we are immensely thankful to our community of teaching a system.

952
01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:57.310 
because they are the bridge in between our staff and our learners.

953
01:07:57.470 --> 01:08:01.330 
they are helping our learners they are engaging with our program

954
01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:04.740 
and they are bringing their ideas in order to improve our program.

955
01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.240 
so let's say that they play an instrumental or key role in

956
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.470 
order to provide a high that experience through massive open online courses.

957
01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:18.640 
thank you so much for your attention. and if you have any further questions

958
01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:23.760

ts sorry it was really expressive.

962
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:45.910 
maybe it's because you are a the mit and we are only a

963
01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:49.880 
university of applied science and luebeck i cannot imagine.

964
01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:52.910 
so many so many a willing tears for

965
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:58.410 
a for forgetting course so are there questions from the audience

967
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.860 
and i'd be happy to start with a question thank you for the presentation

968
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:15.460 
and can you make a give a characteristic of

969
01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.820 
like a good there city.

970
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.710 
what's include the profile

971
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.830 
of such a learner.

972
01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:34.720 
the soul cts also represents our community and the community

973
01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.390 
of learners we have community of city a's

974
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:43.510 
is very diverse i would say they are from many different countries.

975
01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:47.810 
we have city s from india we have city s from germany we have

976
01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:49.930 
city 's from usa. so

977
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:54.540 
very diverse from many different countries.

978
01:09:55.130 --> 01:10:02.080 
they we have let's say two types of city a's one is more these

979
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.810 
kind of student that are really really focus on completing

980
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.990 
a program. our program is also a pathway for a master's degree at mit.

981
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:15.150 
so we have these kind of student that definitely they goal

982
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.000 
is to apply for the blading program they are putting a lot

983
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.060 
of effort in have high grades in all courses studying a lot.

984
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.190 
and they have this sentiment of giving back to the community.

985
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.890 
so this is let's say one bucket of kind of city is very involved

986
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.040 
in the learning experience

987
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.530 
trying to get the maximum score. and also with the sentiment

988
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:43.770 
of sharing with others what they have learned they also use

989
01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:47.460 
and when we asked them about the benefits. they said it is because

990
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:52.620 
they also want to have a more strong networking relationship with the staff

991
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:57.650 
with the other city s on these things so. this is one one group

992
01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:02.480 
another group is professionals we have also professionals currently

993
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.120 
working in the hcm field they join our program, because they really want to

994
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.580 
upskill and they really want to be up to date about the latest techniques.

995
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:17.590 
they are enjoying a lot now at this level of their profession

996
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:21.280 
to learn more and they are also sharing their

997
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:25.540 
professional experience with the rest of the walle and the

998
01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:30.030 
rest of the learners. and this is another kind of a city is

999
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:37.200 
that we have very committed very active in the forum and sharing that experience also

1000
01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.090 
with the other learners. so i would say these kind of two types.

1001
01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:47.300 
but definitely the group also represents the diversity of learners that we have

1002
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:49.190 
in a massive program like this one.

1003
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:54.400 
it is possible to ask a follow up question of course

1004
01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:03.010 
have you noticed anything different in the kind of courses that

1005
01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.650 
attract more city aid

1006
01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.440 
like is there something in the mooc itself that

1007
01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:15.560 
promotes recruitment of city aids from the

1008
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:20.470 
initial group of learners for example in comparison to other courses that

1009
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:25.390 
might be more difficult to recruit city aids for

1010
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:32.600 
i maybe seem to can elaborate more from my perspective.

1011
01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:38.910 
we have our program includes five courses the three first courses are more quantitative.

1012
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:42.270 
the two last courses are more qualitative.

1013
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:47.580 
so definitely we have learners that daler have maps and they are

1014
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:53.130 
very much into the quantitative things so these learners definitely

1015
01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:57.420 
are more willing to collaborate in our first courses is writing

1016
01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:02.240 
analytic subjects in fundamentals. and this kind of courses those learners that

1017
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:07.980 
has more been supplied an approach they are more in the industry.

1018
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.840 
probably they are more willing to collaborate in the two last

1019
01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.590 
courses that are more about technology and data and global supply chains and

1020
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:20.560 
team dynamics that they are a little bit more qualitative.

1021
01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.970 
so probably yes we can differences a little bit about the math

1022
01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:29.820 
background and the willingness to participate in quantitative versus qualitative courses.

1023
01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:34.780 
but at this point of the program i mean we already create

1024
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.680 
this community of volunteers.

1025
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:45.130 
definitely they are the best to engage with others and create this

1026
01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:51.790 
community that they definitely want to give back to and

1027
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:55.980 
contribute to other learners when they are taking the courses they are exposed

1028
01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:59.060 
to receive this help from

1029
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:03.790 
they are previous learners in that course and at some point.

1030
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:07.910 
they say i also want to give back and i also want to contribute. so

1031
01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:11.900 
this is something that we were really really positively surprised

1032
01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:16.860 
when we conduct the survey to learn about the reasons about joining these.

1033
01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:21.640 
these group so yeah i don't know seem to probably you want

1034
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.090 
to elaborate a little bit more on this answer.

1035
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:29.210 
just to add to what evolve said i think the load of the

1036
01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:32.930 
learners also matters in this case because in the five courses

1037
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:37.120 
that we have initially a lot more learners join our program

1038
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.690 
compared to the ones who go ahead, and complete the credential say

1039
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:44.930 
if you have like ten thousand people joining the supply chain

1040
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:48.160 
analytics or fundamentals. in the end you would have say five

1041
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.830 
thousand people remaining who might end up you know going and picking up the

1042
01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:55.340 
credential. so i

1043
01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.940 
oshie slacking

1044
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.090 
maybe some of us have to turn off my camera

1045
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.070 
qualitative ones.

1046
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.000 
i like to request on the speaker to keep the camera on, otherwise

1047
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.380 
i'll be a latency in the

1048
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.070 
collection

1049
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.290 
senior might make you repeat. the last word you said because

1050
01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:37.190 
we could not understand you, yeah

1051
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.830 
i am so sorry

1052
01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:45.970 
internet went bad, so i don't know where you lost me. so i was

1053
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:49.230 
saying that the load of the learners also matters as well i'm

1054
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:52.810 
in the initial few courses a lot. more learners join compared

1055
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:56.180 
to the ones who finish the credential. so we end up hiding more

1056
01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.160 
cvs initially than later on.

1057
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.670 
thank you or other further questions.

1058
01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:10.070 
i

1059
01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:16.080 
can always also write them down into a

1060
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.200 
check, but also unmute you.

1061
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.920 
so i administrative question, if you allow

1062
01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:29.030 
a did the city ace have special access rights to the course,

1063
01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.100 
or  did they have the same view like the the normal learner's.

1064
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:39.080 
they have the same rights as any other learner except

1065
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:46.990 
that a video is one feature in our discussion forum that they are kind of

1066
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:54.580 
discussion follow admin. so when they post something the discussion for whom

1067
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:59.170 
everyone knows that they are a community teaching assistant.

1068
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:03.280 
so in the forums they have some privilege in terms of

1069
01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:09.190 
everyone will know that a community teaching assistant is answering the question.

1070
01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:14.710 
and this is the only privilege they have we also have beta

1071
01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:19.190 
testers. but this is a completely different role and beta testers

1072
01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:23.730 
is another feature that they have privilege in order to have access

1073
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.170 
to some problems earlier than other learners. but this is a

1074
01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:31.750 
completely different role than the city. so for city agents

1075
01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:36.520 
in the discussion forum they have this privilege of being tough as city

1076
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:38.860 
and i think they can answer questions.

1077
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:44.510 
pause the camping pause they can have certain privileges

1078
01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:45.280 
in the forum.

1079
01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:50.330 
thank you very much.

1080
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:55.000 
are there any further questions?

1081
01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:11.370 
if there are not i would like to thank you very much for your

1082
01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:13.950 
presentation and the question answer section

1083
01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:16.990 
also to parker and to my heart.

1
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
So, yeah. Welcome everyone and welcome everyone back to this

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370 
clean-IT openXchange Live Talk in the new year.

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.250 
My name is as always Nils König and I'm here with Sophie

4
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.710 
Schönefeldt from the clean-IT team at HPI.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.570 
Today's guest is professor Benno Schmidt.

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.530 
Benno Schmidt holds a degree in computer science and has developed

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.490 
numerous software products for ecological, geo-scientific and planning applications.

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.080 
His doctoral thesis dealt with linking the data models of geo

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.050 
information systems and interactive 3D visualization environments.

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.540 
Since 2009 he has been a professor of computer

11
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.580 
science and geo informatics at the Bochum University of Applied Sciences.

12
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.570 
His applied research focuses on 3D geo visualization and 3D

13
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.580 
geo data modeling and algorithmic processing as well as formal software specification methods

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.410 
in the environment of geo informatics and environmental specification

15
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.940 
and environmental informatics. A particular concern of his is

16
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.150 
the topic of sustainability in software development and this

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.320 
is of course what we will be talking about today and more specifically

18
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.620 
today we will be talking about software design patterns in

19
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.940 
sustainable software design patterns. And I am very much looking

20
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.530 
forward to today's presentation and the discussion section afterwards.

21
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.940 
And please welcome professor Benno Schmidt.

22
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.590 
Yes, hello there everyone and thank you very much

23
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.380 
Nils for that introduction. I'd like to talk about aspects of

24
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.040 
sustainable development and software engineering processes today.

25
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.560 
It's not my main topic actually and mainly I'm dealing with

26
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.420 
geoinformatics stuff but the

27
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.170 
topic of green software is the most requested topic these days, very curious.

28
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.060 
And anyway, before I start, maybe there's one important thing I want

29
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.360 
to highlight is that we have to distinguish between sustainable by ICT

30
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.270 
and sustainable in ICT. I don't know whether you know that distinction

31
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.680 
but I think it's very important to talk about

32
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.480 
it. Sustainable by information and communication technology

33
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.540 
means that we implement products that lead to more sustainability

34
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.280 
and for example an application for planning wind turbines. And

35
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.460 
it is obvious that this leads to more

36
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.990 
sustainability or a car-pooling or something like this. This

37
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.090 
is sustainable by ICT  and as I often say software

38
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.560 
engineering for the planet. Another thing is sustainability in

39
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.830 
Information and Communication Technology. Sustainable in ICT.

40
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.660 
It's that we make sure that our software products, the products

41
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.530 
we develop as software engineers use fewer resources and that

42
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.240 
is the thing I'm talking about today.

43
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.030 
Let's see where I can get the next slide.

44
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.790 
It works! Well, why do we need sustainable software products? Or as I often

45
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.590 
say, respectively less in sustainable software products.

46
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
Well, I think it's since software of course consumes

47
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.710 
energy and natural resources. It's not only electric energy that is consumed.

48
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.480 
We need a lot of resources to build the hardware we use.

49
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.110 
And where the hardware moreover generates electronic waste

50
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.800 
which is another problem, the

51
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.290 
processes to produce the hardware components and affects social aspects.

52
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.990 
Often there are unfair working conditions social and justice

53
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.700 
and many more effects and so it's very important to reduce the

54
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.390 
resource demand of software. One question that often is asked why software? Software

55
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.990 
does not generate electronic waste. It's the hardware often people say.

56
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.890 
And but noteworthy I'd say, computers need software to operate.

57
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.850 
And if you think more about it in detail, I think I'm convinced that

58
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.630 
the software drives the demand

59
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.470 
for hardware. So it's mainly the software that is responsible for

60
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.210 
this resource demand. So it's not the hardware, it's the software that needs some

61
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.190 
hardware to operate, to run the applications. It's the linking

62
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.610 
between the hardware and the

63
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.640 
use of the products.

64
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.530 
What do we understand by sustainability? This is another important

65
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.010 
thing I would like to highlight at the beginning of my talk. And

66
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.790 
sustainable development

67
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.020 
sustainable development has been defined in many different

68
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.260 
ways. One of the most popular definitions, I think, is the Brundtland Commission's definition

69
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.560 
which goes as this,

70
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.940 
I can read it here - sustainable development meets the needs

71
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.200 
of the present without compromising the ability of future generations

72
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.550 
to meet their own needs. I think this is a definition most of

73
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.980 
you surely came across in the context of my research projects.

74
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.030 
I refer to an extended definition, the definition of integrative sustainability

75
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.140 
where we extend the classical concept of the three pillars of

76
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.860 
sustainability. Those three pillars are the

77
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.040 
ecologic dimension, the economic dimension, and the social dimension.

78
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.170 
And moreover we look at other aspects such as consistency,

79
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.970 
strategy, so that we have

80
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.650 
in the loop , efficiency and sufficiency. Three different strategies

81
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.540 
that are worth

82
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.820 
taking into account - consistency, efficiency, sufficiency. They should

83
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.120 
all be included, I think, it's not

84
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.770 
enough only to develop efficient products and this is not really

85
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.940 
sustainable it's maybe less unsustainable. But I think all these three strategies

86
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.470 
have to be looked at. And then another thing, and we often think about is that

87
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.520 
we assume that there's a unity of mankind, society and nature

88
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.640 
and the idea of a fully functioning society is something we

89
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.270 
assume that if they are a society the world holds together to

90
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
tackle problems that arise in this context.

91
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.170 
Well then the creation and conservation of social fairness

92
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.350 
may be regarded as a crucial aspect of sustainable development

93
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.950 
at our university in Bochum.

94
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.310 
Notably, the term sustainable is not a synonym for long

95
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.140 
lasting but something I

96
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.680 
hear very often from colleagues who say, well, we build software that

97
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.210 
last for a very very long time and often people mix up the

98
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.470 
term sustainable and long lasting.

99
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.930 
There's often a discussion about that and how long should a software last.

100
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.670 
And maybe you came across the Blue Angel, the eco product labeled

101
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.280 
that has been developed by the

102
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.420 
Umwelt Bundesamt Blauer Engel for software products which

103
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.990 
are resource efficient and sustainable. There we've

104
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.480 
got a criteria that software products common software products should

105
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.670 
run on computers that are not

106
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.550 
younger than five years. So if you've got a very up to date

107
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.410 
much up to date computer system that is five years old and the

108
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.070 
system should still run. If it's older

109
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:26.070 
then and it's not necessary to get this eco-label blue angel.

110
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.440 
Well, as said, sustainable is not a synonym for long lasting but

111
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.010 
in fact I think that long lived old products often prevent

112
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.300 
or delay new innovative solutions. So often there are solutions

113
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.250 
that are very long lasting and they

114
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:51.750 
prevent that we can bring more innovative, more sustainable solutions

115
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:57.680 
into the market. Something very interesting aspect to discuss I think.

116
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.120 
Maybe something we can leave for the discussion after my presentations.

117
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.010 
Well one very important question and that's my main research

118
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.290 
question is how can we support software developers

119
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.880 
in the daily business. As software engineers we are building software products

120
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.500 
and in fact we really do not know

121
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:30.990 
what to do or what not to do to generate products that are sustainable.

122
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:38.210 
I think practical guidelines to and hence to assist software architects and programmers

123
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.000 
are really missing in this context.

124
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.430 
And there are some first hints.

125
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.310 
I already mentioned the environment label blue angel for resource and energy efficient

126
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.700 
software products. In case you are interested into this label

127
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.700 
just refer to my last slide there's a link where you can find

128
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.880 
more information about that very interesting projects where there are some

129
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:09.130 
very very first criteria that could qualify software as

130
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.430 
green or as sustainable. But it's really at the beginning

131
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:20.350 
and mainly the social dimension is missing in this context

132
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.810 
and the first process steps when we develop the blue angel be focused on

133
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.430 
mainly ecological aspects, environmental aspects and not on

134
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:35.430 
social aspects. That is something and we have to deal with

135
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.170 
in the near future, I think, to add those social aspects to it.

136
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.660 
Another interesting recommendation has been done by the industry

137
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.830 
association BitKom in Germany that we will find a link at the

138
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.640 
end of this presentation.

139
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:56.080 
So, but they are at the beginning too, but it's a first approaches

140
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.570 
which show which way one could go to

141
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.870 
give guidelines and tends to software architects and programmers to

142
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.760 
be able to develop more sustainable software in the future.

143
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.460 
Different types of support can be distinguished of course.

144
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.090 
There are general guidelines recommendation best practice

145
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.590 
and recommendations and reports and anti-patterns. There are

146
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.820 
a lot of anti-patterns. We know what we should not do to develop a

147
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.780 
sustainable software, so they're more anti-patterns and design patterns

148
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.210 
and for my work a very interesting thing is to find and design

149
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.740 
patterns, to identify patterns that

150
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.830 
apply to recurring problems in the software engineering process

151
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.350 
to develop better software.

152
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.650 
So that's my software the design pattern approach. But it's

153
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.210 
not only about design patterns or topics. There are other kind of guidelines

154
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.630 
that could be very helpful as well.

155
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.420 
I think I do not have to talk about what design patterns are.

156
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.910 
Those patterns you know for example from that famous Game of Thrones

157
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.320 
Gamma et al

158
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:21.020 
and who developed design patterns on the class level to

159
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.310 
solve recurring problems in programming and

160
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.890 
software design, class design processes.

161
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.180 
A short definition for a pattern is it's a proven reusable

162
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.480 
problem solution pair for recurring design problems.

163
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.570 
Not all portions of design knowledge of course give patterns.

164
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:50.010 
And for my work in the context of sustainable software products

165
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:55.670 
some aspects are considered as relevant. One thing is the,

166
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.940 
second thing, the second point bullet on the slide here is that

167
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.450 
a pattern is anchored as well in the software engineering domain

168
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.170 
as well in the domain of sustainability science. So let's say a

169
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.650 
kind of interdisciplinary thing here. We have

170
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.560 
described design entities which are partly from the area from the domain of

171
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.330 
software engineering and on the other side we need a

172
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:29.130 
vocabulary and entities that come from the domain of sustainability sciences

173
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:35.740 
and as you can imagine, of course, this combination is very rare yet.

174
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:44.180 
Well, the last point on the slide as well, I think is very interesting

175
00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.160 
a pattern should show how a positive contribution to sustainability

176
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.020 
issues is actually made. I think it's not sufficient just to describe a pattern.

177
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.990 
What I really want to have in my formal pattern description is

178
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.150 
an explanation how sustainability really is achieved.

179
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.760 
For example both particularly waste that guarantee that really

180
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.660 
sustainability is achieved. So it's not just

181
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.770 
a wish we have. It should be more sustainable, we have to control

182
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.850 
it too and guarantee that this

183
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.990 
aim really is achieved.

184
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.360 
We do not have real patterns yet, I think.

185
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.640 
There are some pattern candidates we already identified.

186
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:44.810 
I set up a gital repository where you can find some description of patern candidates,

187
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.440 
for example a very simple pattern is the compensate pattern.

188
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.760 
It goes like this, I mean you just run

189
00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:00.740 
a software, the software and consumes energy and you implement a mechanism that

190
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.830 
compensates the

191
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.250 
CO2 carbon emissions generated by the software,

192
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.990 
by mechanisms, for example the Ecosia search engine is an example

193
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:22.310 
for that. So it just compensate it. A very simple pattern a simple mechanism you could implement

194
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.810 
to neutralize carbon emissions.

195
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.310 
Other interesting patterns are backward compatibility for example

196
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.330 
that you find in the blue angel specification as well as caching

197
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.490 
to prevent standby things

198
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.490 
and custom pattern is postponed into green phase

199
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:47.770 
so that you run your product and at a time when green energy is available.

200
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.910 
Opensource could be an interesting pattern and so

201
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:58.330 
on. There are many interesting pattern candidates which require further investigation,

202
00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.680 
whether they really

203
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.320 
will help to

204
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.990 
lead to more sustainable software products.

205
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.320 
I think we have to search for more pattern candidates and you

206
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.280 
really welcome to join pattern mining, as I call this activity

207
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.300 
and to bring in new design ideas.

208
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:29.120 
Well, one word about formal descriptions. Why do I want formal descriptions?

209
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.430 
One point is that the problem and solution are described less ambiguously.

210
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.480 
Then another thing is that the interacting software technical

211
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.640 
units become explicit and thus the gap between pattern description

212
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.030 
and software development process gets smaller.

213
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.280 
Another interesting thing I think is machine readability. So

214
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.010 
for example we could set up a searchable pattern repository.

215
00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:01.620 
No more extensive knowledge models to process software development

216
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.210 
knowledge in this fields.

217
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.090 
And another interesting aspect of course is that you can check

218
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.760 
our pattern descriptions for logical completeness and consistency.

219
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.350 
And it's a standard thing we really like to do as computer scientists

220
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.980 
when we are active in the field of formal specification and methods.

221
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.890 
But I do not want to bore you

222
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.020 
with the technical details here and anyone who is interested

223
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:39.440 
in the way, I go to describe my patterns formally and

224
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.990 
feel free to contact me. There are several paper papers about

225
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.010 
it . The links can be found at the end of the paper

226
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.980 
and some examples are in this presentation.

227
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.860 
But I think I will skip the formal stuff then.

228
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.950 
And but maybe just in one sentence about that and we use a

229
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.770 
two layer approach among an abstract level, we describe

230
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.610 
pattern descriptions using a language called PLML, it's

231
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.100 
a Pattern Language Markup Language. It's a semi formal language

232
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.740 
that allows us to describe patterns in general and then we embed

233
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.390 
more detailed descriptions

234
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.900 
into this PLML descriptions to

235
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.920 
provide executable pattern descriptions. So how I do which is

236
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.070 
the standard I have to break approach, you know from languages

237
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:39.210 
such as SQL or OBJ, I know CafeOBJ for that and it has

238
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.490 
the advantage that I can execute my

239
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.350 
pattern and descriptions can check them for

240
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.410 
completeness whether the description is

241
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:55.070 
complete enough to express what I want to express and I can check it for

242
00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.290 
consistency, whether there are no

243
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:06.120 
inconsistent and part in it. But over it becomes machine-processable by this way.

244
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.600 
And one important aspect is that we can extract the basic

245
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:15.280 
building units of our software patterns this way. So it's a way and

246
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:21.050 
I really appreciate doing it like that. Otherwise would be to use UML, OCL

247
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.360 
languages from ontology engineering or other approaches.

248
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.250 
Okay, a simple example about that can be found

249
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.420 
on the slides. It gets a bit technical they're set in case

250
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.100 
you are interested and feel free to a

251
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.010 
read the paper about it. Mainly it's an XML description. Here

252
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.220 
on the right side you see a PLML snippet that describes

253
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.180 
the problem solution embedded. You will find a formalization element

254
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.220 
and this formalization element here for example is a good algebraic

255
00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.030 
specification which is executable and can be checked whether it's

256
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.560 
consistent and complete.

257
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.580 
Well, I think I said most things.

258
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.170 
This slide maybe it's interesting here find an extended example

259
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.830 
of such a description and what I think is very important that

260
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.090 
we describe not only the software technical entities involved in those patterns,

261
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:34.540 
but only considering human factors. I think all this stuff

262
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.260 
has to do with human factors as well. For example here I describe an

263
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.110 
emulator pattern yeah that's the name.

264
00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:55.390 
Emulator pattern and this pattern would just work if the user

265
00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:01.120 
thinks it's okay to use to apply this pattern. For example if he is

266
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.780 
unsatisfied by the usage of an emulator, the pattern will not

267
00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.940 
work at all. So the human is involved in it. So will the user

268
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.190 
be willing to continue to use an existing

269
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.090 
using this emulator. Another thing is the emulator really has

270
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.910 
been made available by a software manufacturer. This requires

271
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.600 
human action as well and this is the case with all those other

272
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.420 
patterns as well. There's always

273
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.340 
humans involved in those processes. So I think it's

274
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:38.540 
a good idea to integrate human factors into these technical pattern descriptions

275
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.810 
as well.

276
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.780 
So my conclusions - there's a demand for sustainability design

277
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.680 
patterns as well as other guidelines of course which support

278
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.260 
software developers in their daily business.

279
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:01.110 
I think it appears that sustainability design patterns are really identifiable, so that

280
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.970 
I think we should continue to work there to identify patterns

281
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:12.530 
and to describe those solutions. Basic questions are which patterns already exist.

282
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.690 
We have to do a more patterm mining, I think and how to document these patterns.

283
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:25.900 
Although the question of documentation I think it's not a primary problem. It's a

284
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.860 
secondary thing and the main thing is that we have to find those patterns.

285
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.150 
So the pattern candidates have been identified and but these

286
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.550 
are all still candidates. We have to

287
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:43.880 
verify that is really our pattern. There is one rule of something that says and

288
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:48.490 
a pattern is a pattern when at least five people applied

289
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.340 
to a common recurring problem and this critical number has

290
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.620 
not been reached yet, since very few people deal with software

291
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.620 
design patterns in the field of sustainability. But I'm

292
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.880 
optimistic that we can which is a number

293
00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.230 
so that the first candidates really can

294
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.920 
became become patterns there.

295
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.400 
As said, it is desirous for formal descriptions. And

296
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.830 
maybe a word about my next steps - it could be a good idea

297
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.340 
to collect existing guidelines, checklist, pattern collections

298
00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.820 
and to bring together the work of existing working groups

299
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.450 
in this area.

300
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:46.680 
Those who are interested find an experimental pattern repository on GitHub

301
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.670 
and be on the slide you'll find the

302
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.650 
rep link. That's also under presentation there first and pattern

303
00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:03.500 
descriptions in it, as said, all candidates and in case you identify more patterns

304
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.710 
I would be glad if you would contact me or

305
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.640 
put a pool request into GitHub that we can add it to the collection.

306
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.270 
The last slide I think

307
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.900 
it just my references, in case you're interested in

308
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.970 
more information about those things I'm dealing with. So thank

309
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.870 
you very much for listening and I'm really curious about your questions

310
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.640 
and for the discussion.

311
00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.650 
And I give back to Nils.

312
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.890 
Yeah, thank you very much for your very interesting presentation.

313
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.470 
So someone already asked me in the chat whether the presentation

314
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.460 
slides will be made available and yes we're going to upload them

315
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.820 
together with the recording as always in the cleanIT Forum.

316
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.490 
So then there you can see all those links

317
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:59.720 
again and you can also dive a little deeper. So I think you skipped the emulator

318
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.500 
example in your presentation today which is mentioned or explained

319
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.000 
a little further in detail in this slide. So you can of course take a deeper

320
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.090 
look into that and with that I think we can go

321
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.500 
over to the QnA or discussion section now. So please if

322
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.700 
you have any questions you can either raise your hand

323
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.040 
so that we can pick you and you can ask a question in person

324
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.360 
or you can also of course ask your question in the chat. And

325
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.070 
my first question maybe are some people are still

326
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.360 
thinking, you've presented these candidates today, so

327
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.630 
have these all been identified so far by you or by

328
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.860 
a work group of yours or how have these come together so far?

329
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.120 
These candidates.

330
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.530 
Well there are a lot of information sources. One of course is

331
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.780 
things that I observed personally. Then there are

332
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:54.020 
some things are parts of results of discussions with colleagues

333
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.430 
and some patterns came from the discussions in the working

334
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:02.470 
group that developed the blue angel. I've been involved in that

335
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.480 
working group for many years and there some

336
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.140 
patterns occurred and some patterns have been

337
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.870 
found. And the bitkom guidelines for example, whenever I

338
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.820 
read a paper about sustainable software, I get the

339
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.580 
impression this could be a pattern.

340
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.370 
I investigated in more detail and

341
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.390 
sometimes I added them.

342
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.350 
So a lot of different sources. Really pattern

343
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.740 
mining, what we're doing here.

344
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.020 
And so my next question, it kind of follows up on that a little.

345
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.210 
You mentioned the GitLab where we can pull a pull request

346
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.750 
or something like that. So would you say that that would be

347
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.520 
the best way to help in finding new patterns or are there any

348
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.410 
any conferences or working groups that someone can join or

349
00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.610 
is the best way to help and work at these projects to really just

350
00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.730 
file pull requests on the GitLab?

351
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:04.440 
There are conferences, the best thing to talk about it but definitely conferences I think.

352
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.860 
There is one conference, it is called ICT for sustainability.

353
00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.180 
It is regularly on the

354
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.720 
world wide level and then very useful is the

355
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.510 
enviroinfo, is the name.

356
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.780 
Enviroinfo

357
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.850 
conference

358
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.270 
by the Gesselschaft for Informatik in Germany

359
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.760 
which regularly takes place

360
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:48.940 
and then there is a special working group called Umwelt Informatik.

361
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.230 
It is environmental informatics

362
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.300 


363
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.860 


364
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.540 
by the

365
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.200 
Gesselschaft for Informatik.

366
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.380 
They are very active in this field.

367
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.230 
Okay great. I think with the recording we can also

368
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.150 
provide these links later then when we upload the video.

369
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.670 
Very very interesting. So I see in the chat that

370
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.930 
Maxim Asjoma is raising his hand. So please go ahead and ask a question.

371
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:38.220 
Hi everybody, hi professor Schmidt, thank you very much for the nice presentation

372
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:42.250 
and the presentation of the software design patterns.

373
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.410 
Can you make an assertion about how deep those software design patterns are already

374
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.830 
rooted in academic curricula? So,

375
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.860 
do students in Germany of computer science learn enough about this already or

376
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.210 
is there something more we can do about it?

377
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.650 
It's a great question. I think

378
00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.810 
we talk a lot about that on conferences as well and on workshops.

379
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.000 
And as far as I know it's not yet integrated into curricular.

380
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.680 
I've got one lecture called software design

381
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.730 
for master students at our university. There are first modules

382
00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:29.040 
to deal with this topic and as far as I know the colleague

383
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.370 
Stephan Naumann from the University of Trier integrated first things into

384
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.880 
his lectures as well. But I think we're really at the beginning there.

385
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:43.810 
There are quite a lot of requests that reach me

386
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:48.540 
from other countries, for example from Sweden as well and that ask can be

387
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.970 
set up such a curriculum but it's not yet there but it could

388
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.970 
be an interesting idea to set up

389
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.520 
a consortium that tries to

390
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.360 
set up such

391
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.870 
teaching units. Now I think that, I know that Stephan Naumann

392
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.250 
has got a lot of material there. I've got a lot of slides that

393
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:09.690 


394
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:16.680 
convince you that is really important to talk about the topic.

395
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:21.410 
And a lot of methodological things that are worth being looked

396
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.890 
at and to be taught and at universities I think. So in case

397
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.830 
you are interested there, feel free to contact me and it would

398
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.880 
be great if you could set up a working group maybe. And that

399
00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.640 
would set up such a curriculum. It would be a great thing.

400
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.480 
There are questions as well by the way.

401
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.080 
They are often questions by

402
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.680 
Springer Verlag and other Verlage.

403
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:53.500 
What's it in english anyway? And whether we could write a teaching

404
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.430 
book about that as well. So in case you are interested to become active

405
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:02.720 
in this field, feel free to contact me or Stephan Naumann as well as

406
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.800 
someone who knows the community as well very well.

407
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.480 
There are some actors that are really interesting in

408
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.330 
becoming more active in the field of teaching there.

409
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.880 
Thank you very much for your answer. I want to also add to that.

410
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.220 
So I recently heard about an entire study programme by the University of

411
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.190 
Würzburg which is I think the first one which is entirely

412
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:33.560 
focused around sustainability and IT together. So there I think

413
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.120 
sustainability is not just one part which you can focus in

414
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.650 
but it's really a core point of the entire study programme and

415
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.550 
that's also something very interesting and they have developed

416
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.830 
an entire curriculum about this or around this topic already.

417
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.050 
And so I think you can also check this out if you're interested in

418
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.150 
taking such courses. Would be freat if you could send me a link then.

419
00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:01.620 
Yeah sure I'll write it down to the chat. Yeah okay, so meanwhile I'll

420
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.340 
take Michaela for the next question. Please go ahead.

421
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:22.330 
... I think speech quality has been too poor to understand the question.

422
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.290 
Maybe you could put it into the chat?

423
00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.340 
Or maybe you could raise your voice a little or your microphone.

424
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.910 
Shout it out loud!

425
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.280 
I don't know, there must be a problem, I will write it in the chat.

426
00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:45.850 
Yes, maybe that's a better way. And so I think while

427
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.760 
you're writing your question, I have another question from the chat

428
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.120 
from Alexander. What are the obstacles to use sustainable coding?

429
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.240 
They're what we call in German "Innerer Schweinehund".

430
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.960 
Whatever that means in english.

431
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.610 
Well rebound effects, I think. I often read

432
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:07.530 
programme thinks and as a software developer

433
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:13.690 
we have the impression know it works well on my up to date computer and

434
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.430 
maybe we get more hardware, more efficient hardware and everything that

435
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.840 
works well on this hardware

436
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:27.690 
is produced there without taking into account what charger other people have and

437
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.780 
without caring about that everyone needs the same computer

438
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.710 
that I have to use the software. So it's really this rebound effect we've

439
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.930 
got and more hardware efficiency and then we really use it.

440
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.280 
That is one of the obstacles I think. And another thing of course

441
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:52.420 
is and we have to sensitize developers in the area of

442
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.660 
software development that is really is an issue.

443
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.590 
Most people think well, I do it and I don't have to care

444
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.490 
about sustainability. They are not aware about

445
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.430 
that it really is a problem.

446
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.270 
The main thing is that

447
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:13.080 
that we make hardware become obsolescent. So slowly obsolescence

448
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.480 
I think that is the main aspect. The things we do will lead

449
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:20.820 
to obsolescence of hardware. I think that's the main problem we have to tackle.

450
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.590 
Yes sure Alexander please go ahead

451
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.480 
if you want to answer that.

452
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.770 
Or if you have any follow-up question.

453
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.100 
Okay, I see he's raising his hand but

454
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.230 
..oh yeah, we can hear now.

455
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:50.760 
Sorry about this. I'm on two channels here. No problem.

456
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.740 
Thank you much very much for your insights.

457
00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:02.050 
I heard from programmers that it's another "nichtfunktional bedingung", you know

458
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.050 
they really shook their head and run away.

459
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.770 
That's my conclusion, that's why I post this here

460
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.260 
for this group. Maybe there's others but you quite confirm what I've heard.

461
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.440 
To make programmers or to makes a software sustainable don't

462
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.790 
you think there's a need of other incentives and

463
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.300 
would you have any idea what other incentives that could be?

464
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.390 
Just for your general information, I am

465
00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.760 
the stakeholder or organizer of the World Summit Award it's

466
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.250 
it's an international award we give away since seventeen

467
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:46.090 
years. It's called WSA Germany and we promote software that

468
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:50.120 
supports the sustainable development goals. So this is software

469
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.570 
this is software for

470
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.580 
supporting the goals but we're just opening the new category

471
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.140 
which is not a category, we're also going to look at

472
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.830 
how sustainable the software it is for itself.

473
00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.950 
Exactly what you're looking at. And I'm also in the Bitkom working group

474
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:14.740 
Nachhaltigkeit and you know that there's a resource shown in the software Entwicklung paper

475
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:21.470 
So I think this is a very big topic since we know seven percent

476
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:26.360 
you know goes of the carbon emission goes

477
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.270 
to ICT in two thousand thirty, that's the

478
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:34.130 
outlook. So there is a big demand on

479
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.590 
making this aware to programmers. And I really like the input of

480
00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:43.180 
you know from Uni Würzburg, I looked at that before.

481
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:48.310 
And that's also what you do. So my question maybe a lot of co-referat here,

482
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.660 
is for the general public here.

483
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.860 
What do you think could drive

484
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.110 
decision-makers to beware or actually incentivise

485
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.750 
green programming green coding as I might call it,

486
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.230 
and green design by the way. It is the whole process.

487
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.810 
Well it's a big question. And we had the same question last

488
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.320 
week on a conference about sustainability did not really find

489
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.980 
an answer - why do we

490
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.570 
for example buy products which have got blue angel, it is

491
00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:33.390 
the same question maybe. Why do we buy a fridge that

492
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:38.130 
onsumes less energy and what is

493
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.880 
the thing that really drives us?

494
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.500 
Well, I really don't know. It's the same with eco-labels. Why

495
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.720 
do we buy products with eco-labels? One good thing could be to

496
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.840 
introduce such labels of course so that we

497
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:59.580 
show the world that we und care about those things when developing our product.

498
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:04.030 
For example this is a very interesting thing one could do. And

499
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.490 
maybe one of the other participants here has an idea

500
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:12.770 
what really could drive the process, what is our motivation to

501
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.630 
develop more sustainable products.

502
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.200 
Of course we all want to fight climate change, of course.

503
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.540 
But what really could convince us to

504
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.140 
do it with more emphasis?

505
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:32.670 
I think one big idea in the chat has been a silicon text

506
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.830 
or harder regulation as an idea for incentives.

507
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.810 
Regulation is also negative, I think. Regulation

508
00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.520 
is not motivating, I think. That's another constraint

509
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.710 
you have to take into account when developing.

510
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:55.550 
But of course this could be one thing but

511
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.170 
I think it sounds negative.

512
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.870 
As I said from our side, we will give out a prize for that next year

513
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.730 
at the WSA Germany. That was one thing and

514
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:13.220 
I think one other thing we're looking at, I mean very seriously now,

515
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.460 
how much worth is it in

516
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.670 
the carbon text

517
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.750 
equation. I mean that's - I'd love to talk to you later

518
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:26.600 
on it. I mean, if you put figures behind it suddenly then

519
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.570 
the business decision-makers are also behind it.

520
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.880 
So that's what we're looking at also. Although it is very very

521
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.620 
difficult to measure the real carbon emission of products

522
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.120 
especially since we have lots of web services, things from the cloud and

523
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.360 
it's very difficult to really trace this I think.

524
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.850 
One has to start that at one point.

525
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.220 
Yeah thank you very much.

526
00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:04.060 
Well awards could be another thing, or anti-awards for the most unsustainable product.

527
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.310 
Another thing you could do.

528
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.380 
Okay thank you very much for your very broad answer. So I think

529
00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.720 
we can move to the next question from Michaela.

530
00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.700 
How do you verify a pattern or how do they have verified whether

531
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.060 
a pattern is actually a sustainability pattern

532
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.790 
and promote sustainability?

533
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.700 
Well that's an interesting question.

534
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:31.750 
I brought this in my my last, not my last paper, a paper from two years ago and

535
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.020 
there I had to aim that I really

536
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:40.580 
want the explanation how a pattern contributes to sustainability

537
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.140 
gets part of the pattern description.

538
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.700 
So there we really explain it logically.

539
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:54.150 
Okay, so as an logical inherent explanation and not just something

540
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.250 
to measure really. Okay, although I personally do not work

541
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:02.310 
with quantitative measures they are only qualitative.

542
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:07.210 
Okay and maybe one other point. It's not only carbon

543
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:11.190 
emissions that is important. I think resource consumption and

544
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.180 
seltene Erden etcetera and electronic waste etcetera.

545
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:21.880 
And Produktionsbedingungen, production conditions. There are a lot of aspects that

546
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.540 
have to do with the sustainability. It's not only carbon emissions of course.

547
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:31.580 
Sure, yes yes. So the next question is are there any subsets

548
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.810 
of patterns, for example as patterns which are specifically

549
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.980 
for object-oriented design or other types of software design or other

550
00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:45.030 
metrics? I'm not so far yet. I'm not so far yet. Not enough patterns to classify them.

551
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.420 
It would be great to be there someday. Is that something you're

552
00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.380 
aiming for to classify this in different types and and groups?

553
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.300 
Well, if there is a certain number of patterns available of

554
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.680 
course we have to specify them so get an overview.

555
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.220 
Okay. We are far away from that.

556
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:10.730 
So, the next question is resilience a dimension of sustainability?

557
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.430 
I can imagine arguments for and against resilience. It is costly but approximations

558
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.210 
etcetera can lead to various issues.

559
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.330 
I really don't know.

560
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:32.760 
Maybe one other participant has an idea about this.

561
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:37.180 
Does anyone have an opinion on that? The discussion is open.

562
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:52.580 
I don't see any specific comments.

563
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.120 
Who asked the question?

564
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.830 
I think Michaela asked the question

565
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.570 
from earlier today.

566
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.490 
Maybe she's got more ideas about that.

567
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:16.390 
So someone said there's an overlap between resilience and hardware parsimoniously.

568
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:21.340 
And maybe you could also explain that a little further if you want to.

569
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:32.540 
Yes, I can. From my understanding, so one aspect of resilience is that

570
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.260 
you are relatively robust against

571
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.210 
very high technical hardware requirements. So if a software's running

572
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:46.690 
on any device that hasn't much memory and much CPU, then this is also

573
00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.330 
an aspect of resilience.

574
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:55.180 
So therefore I see this overlap between resilience and needing

575
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.380 
little hardware to be happy with old hardware that allows to

576
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.930 
prioritize the hardware longer.

577
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.390 
Yes, maybe there is another pattern on an architectural level.

578
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.850 
Synced client pattern or something like that,

579
00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.600 
I have to think about that later. Why not?

580
00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:17.630 


581
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.210 
Okay, so another question from the chat is more

582
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:26.860 
generally is it possible to have patterns that suggest

583
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.780 
a programming language for a specific use case.

584
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:34.660 
So that would take into consideration the existence of required

585
00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.980 
dependencies and efficiency of the various languages.

586
00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:39.910 
Interesting question

587
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.510 
indeed. It could be possible that the choice of the programming

588
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:50.870 
language could have impact. For example in the bitkom guidelines there's an interesting

589
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:56.650 
text fragment about reactive programming languages for example, which

590
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.900 
maybe could lead to

591
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:04.320 
less energy consumption, something that I'm requires attention I think.

592
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.100 
For example reactive programming paradigms could be an interesting thing there.

593
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.260 
But I assume that other things could

594
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:17.300 
contribute to that as well and I did not come across

595
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.820 
some studies which focus this topic in further detail yet.

596
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.850 
I think I've already found

597
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.370 
some Portuguese in

598
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.890 
researches which try to measure the energy efficiency of different

599
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.020 
programming languages and I can also provide the

600
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.570 
link to that paper and which was very interesting and where

601
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.140 
you really could see very big differences between the different

602
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:45.530 
programming languages and paradigms.

603
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:51.500 
And okay, so the next question would be and I think this is almost

604
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.650 
the last question already. In reference to your statement

605
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.940 
in the beginning, sustainability by technology is different

606
00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.250 
than sustainability through or sustainability in technology.

607
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:06.290 
Does the economy already adapt sustainability in or through technology?

608
00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.810 
Our experience is that sustainability is only worthwhile if

609
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.170 
an immediate economic benefit can be generated for example

610
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.860 
by reducing the energy consumption.

611
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.420 
Maybe you could complete a bit. In ICT and by ICT, yeah?

612
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:28.230 
Yeah, so I think what is meant with the question

613
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:33.590 
that it is often the the only incentive for companies to make

614
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:39.870 
IT itself more sustainable. So this sustainability in technology or through technology

615
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:45.300 
point is only used if there are economic incentives like

616
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:49.390 
energy costs. And do you see examples where

617
00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:53.410 
also other incentives are useful or used?

618
00:46:54.890 --> 00:47:00.790 
Well, some people just want to live sustainable. It's

619
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:05.410 
maybe a way of living, I think. So it's a living philosophy and

620
00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.120 
there are a lot of people who really want

621
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.930 
to live this philosophy. So I think it's very important and

622
00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.820 
by the way that's another important pattern. One pattern is

623
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:19.370 
called the sustainability awareness pattern.

624
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.730 
You can think about software that

625
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:27.380 
improves the awareness of the user about sustainability.

626
00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:34.040 
Ecosia for example is such an example which makes the user being

627
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:38.130 
getting more aware about sustainability issues now. So that's

628
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.520 
a very interesting balance

629
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.200 
that you generate a psychological thing.

630
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:50.610 
Yeah. Okay, so I think I don't see any particularly

631
00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:54.220 
new questions in the chat and we've had a lot of a links shared

632
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.240 
today and I will do my best to collect all these links and

633
00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.700 
references together and put them in the community forum afterwards.

634
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:04.790 
So please give us a few days but I think by the end of the

635
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.280 
week or maybe next week, we can then provide you all these informations.

636
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.840 
And, so I think if I understood you right, the easiest way

637
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.330 
for really everyone here or everyone else who is interested

638
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.840 
to participate is just to look at the GitLab repository

639
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.210 
that you shared with us and just to try and find new patterns

640
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:26.550 
or maybe formally describe the candidates that are already there?

641
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:31.440 
Is that the best way to do it? Well, that's one way to do it and

642
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.510 
you also find my contributions on researchgate, for example.

643
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.710 
Another thing is of course just send me an email. There

644
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:43.900 
are some interesting working groups dealing with the aspects of

645
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:49.790 
sustainability in the software. For example these days, there is a very interesting

646
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:55.210 
project which is funded by the Umwelt Bundesamt

647
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.980 
which is carried out by the SDI alliance, the software project.

648
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:04.050 
I don't know whether came across that. It's interesting. They try to

649
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:09.110 
integrate built tools for example made into the software development process

650
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:13.110 
which check the software for energy consumption or other

651
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:18.010 
sustainability measures. That's a very important thing. Another project

652
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:21.860 
where I'm concerned with these days, I have seen something in the chat about it,

653
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:28.610 
is the question how can machine learning applications contribute to

654
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:33.180 
interesting applications which

655
00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:39.450 
now contribute to the issue of sustainability by ICT software for the planet

656
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.960 
and a lot of interesting things. So feel free to contact me.

657
00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.260 
Okay, yeah sorry.

658
00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:51.360 
Send emails. Yeah, of course.

659
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:56.060 
There will be the email of course in the forum, so everyone interested

660
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.640 
can send you anything they like.

661
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.450 
Okay, so I don't see any other statements from the participants.

662
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.300 
So I'll just quickly, for the end,

663
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.960 
I will show my screen again to show you what's coming

664
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.580 
up next. So in four weeks we will see each other again and this

665
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.490 
time our next guest will be Tobias Gerbothe from the

666
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.390 
Otto group solution provider talking about how is sustainability

667
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:21.950 
as a corporate paradigm and I also want to mention again that

668
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:25.850 
we will have the cleanIT community conference at the end of March.

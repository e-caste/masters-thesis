00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.600 
In our OpenHPI course,
half-century of internet,

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.540 
we want to finish
second week

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.910 
which was a week about
computer networks

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.850 
with a short
historical overview.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.800 
Let's start with the
internet and IP history.

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.410 
We already mentioned
that 1969 this was the

7
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.870 
birth year of ARPANET.

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.730 
And it was the birth
year of the internet.

9
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.780 
The internet technology is a
technology of local area networks

10
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.690 
which today is the most popular,
it was started in 1973

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660 
by Robert Metcalfe
and David Boggs.

12
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.110 
Then we had a development in the
bandwidth of this internet.

13
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.140 
The networks became broader
and broader in 1980,

14
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.000 
we had a 10 MBit in
the year 1981. There

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.800 
was this standard of the IP protocols
the RFC, the internet protocol

16
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.810 
published in 1995.

17
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.720 
We had the first ethernet
with more than 100 MBit

18
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.350 
bandwidth 1999,
ethernets with

19
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.440 
with more bandwidth
than 1 Gigabit, 2001

20
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:47.470 
with 10 a Gigabit. So this was a very he
fast development of network technology,

21
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.390 
which is the basis of the
internet and it reflects the

22
00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.080 
huge demand for interchanging
data between systems.

23
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.890 
2014, the 2.5 Gigabit
ethernet was developed.

24
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.380 
When we look at the
hardware development,

25
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.270 
since 1967,

26
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.820 
IMPs were developed. These are node
computers which are used in the

27
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.660 
ARPANET. Then 1976, the first
IP router wete developed.

28
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.770 
Ginny Strazisar is the name
to mention here. IP routers

29
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.390 
for computing the next hub for transmitting
data over a network of network.

30
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.860 
1985, the first bridges

31
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.880 
came to the market in Kaplana.
Ethernet switch it was on the

32
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.750 
market in 1990. And today we
see that we have such devices

33
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.790 
all in one that computes different tasks
that are necessary to interconnect

34
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.330 
a computer to
the internet.

35
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.210 
Let's look at the
development of Wi-Fi, the

36
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.190 
wireless network technology
which started in 1971 with

37
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.230 
the implementation
of ALOHAnet,

38
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.510 
then in 1980, there was the
development of 802.11

39
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.030 
standards which
standardized

40
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.890 
the wireless network
technologies.

41
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.510 
1997, the release of
the IEEE 802.11

42
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.540 
the extension
was published

43
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.400 
and in 1999 802.11a

44
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.590 
which was important for
the recent development

45
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.580 
with a large bandwidth also in
the mobile networks this was

46
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.400 
released as a
standard 802.11ax

47
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.380 
and ay in the year 2019
which provides very

48
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.540 
broadband mobile
devices. In 2020

49
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.220 
the development of
the IEEE 802.11bw

50
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.960 
so-called WiFi
7 the IEEE

51
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.420 
organization is working on and
published this information.

52
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.630 
These are only some dates which
show how fast this development

53
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.570 
in the internet was going on the
hardware side, on the network side

54
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.720 
in wireless technologies. So
today's internet where we can

55
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:16.760 
transmit videos in seconds over
wireless networks that mark

56
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.430 
the status of communication,
which earlier 50 years ago

57
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.210 
nobody had assumed that
it can be reached.

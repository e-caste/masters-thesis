00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.040 
This is knowledge graphs lecture
number six "Advanced Knowledge

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.200 
Graph Applications. This is the
very last part of the lecture

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.680 
and here we are going to talk
about exploratory search and

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.090 
recommender systems, of course
based on knowledge graphs.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.330 
Ok you might remember from the last
part of the lecture that there is an

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.250 
extreme difference between
retrieval and exploration.

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.790 
What again was that
kind of difference?

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.440 
Retrieval - in retrieval usually
you are looking for something

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.050 
that you already know or more or
less like to know, or you know

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.510 
how to describe the stuff. It means you
are looking for something familiar.

11
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
You know that for example in a library
when you're looking for a book

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.640 
what you have often in mind is
the title of the book or the

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.680 
name of the author. So like for
example if you look for that

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.800 
book that you see here
in the right corner,

15
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.680 
the author is Jule Verne and the
title is "From the Earth to the

16
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.390 
Moon", which means you are often using
kind of unique identifiers like

17
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.200 
name of the author plus name of the
title, or you use descriptive

18
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
metadata to describe what exactly
you are looking for because

19
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.600 
you know that already. You are
familiar with the domain,

20
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.710 
you know how to describe this stuff.
So then retrieval is no problem.

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.750 
However there might be other
situations. What do you do in the

22
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.190 
library? To stay exactly
at that example,

23
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.260 
in older times what you did is of course
you went to the library catalogue

24
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.920 
and within the catalogue you were
looking for exactly the right

25
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
card, the catalog card, for exactly
the book you were looking for

26
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.410 
and there you found itJules Verne
"From the Earth to the Moon"

27
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.190 
and you saw also exactly the title
in reality is even a bit longer

28
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.870 
and it has been here released in,
sorry, eighteen seventy three.

29
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.590 
And in the end you see a few
numbers and stuff like that and

30
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.340 
this in the end showed you the
directions to the shelf where

31
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.490 
to find the book
in the end.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.400 
This was the the solution to
your retrieval problem.

33
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.090 
However you read the book and
then of course what you want

34
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.270 
to do you want to find another
comparable book, because you

35
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.570 
should find something that also
interests you in reading but

36
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.400 
now you have no idea what
exactly to look for, because

37
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.170 
what could be in similar
interesting, what could be somehow

38
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.900 
related? So you will find books of
the same or of related topics.

39
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.280 
And for example also you want to know
how did the author then develop

40
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.950 
over the timer or how did the topic
travelling to the moon develop over time?

41
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.960 
So what else should I
like to read? No idea.

42
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.440 
In the end you should come up
with something like this, which

43
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.040 
means meaningful recommendations
of books which are likewise

44
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.440 
of interest, if you have already an
interest in, for example, that book.

45
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.280 
That might be rather similar book,
that might also be related

46
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.160 
books and they might be related
directly or directly similar or

47
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.780 
indirectly. And this is something a
problem that is addressed for example

48
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.230 
besides other problems by
exploratory search. So you want to

49
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.540 
explore what's in there in your library,
which means in your information system.

50
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.680 
And of course in the library this was
much more easier than it is nowadays

51
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.390 
on the web, because in the
library you might remember

52
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.650 
there are shelves and of course these
shelves usually are organized

53
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.260 
according to specific
ordering principles. So

54
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.130 
simply traditional libraries enable exploratory
search by providing you shelves which

55
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.920 
contain books ordered according
to a specific system. Mostly

56
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.180 
in one shelf they might be ordered at
alphabetically or chronologically.

57
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.700 
However if you go to a public
library there is a section of

58
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.270 
classic science fiction novels, for
example, where you find exactly the book

59
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.950 
that we were looking for and also
in the same shelf you might find

60
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.440 
books of the same category and there
of course there might be something

61
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.540 
of your interest.

62
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.510 
And if you don't know how to proceed? What
you do then in a traditional library?

63
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.520 
Of course you are going to ask
your friendly librarian because

64
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.220 
he can give you intelligent
recommendations.

65
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.480 
And exactly that exploratory search as
well as intelligent recommendations

66
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.230 
are two applications that are
supported by knowledge graphs and

67
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.960 
knowledge graph based technologies. And
this wewill take a look into it today.

68
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.370 
So first of all let us define
what is exploratory search.

69
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.890 
Exploratory search represents all the
activities that are carried out

70
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.110 
by a searcher or by searchers who are in the
first place unfamiliar with the domain

71
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.780 
of their goal. It means they need
to learn about the topic in

72
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.730 
order to understand how
to achieve that goal.

73
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.760 
They are often unsure about the ways
how to achieve their goals, so

74
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.760 
what should I use as a search string? And
they are either unsure about the technology

75
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.820 
or of the process how to do that.
And sometimes even they are

76
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.790 
unsure about the goals in the
first place which means

77
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.730 
I look for something interesting but
how should I phrase it? So this is

78
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.620 
kind of different. What
you want to do there?

79
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.520 
You want to go for more or less like
browsing instead of searching.

80
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.830 
In the library or in a bookshop
it's quite easy. So you simply

81
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.940 
look at the shelves and you browse
through the shelves. So this

82
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.690 
is kind of exploring of
course the content.

83
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.770 
How do you do that with
the internet or the web?

84
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.190 
There are billions of documents
and they are not ordered in

85
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.320 
any sense. So this is really really
difficult because what you

86
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.170 
want to do, you want to find you want
discover something by chance that

87
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.710 
you did not know that exists,
that you did not know you were

88
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.410 
looking for, but it's there and
of course you are interested

89
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.000 
in it. Hurray! So this
is called serendipity.

90
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.890 
Sometimes also you want to get
an overview ,so what kind of

91
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.000 
other books did that guy read or
write and sometimes you want to

92
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.420 
enabled content-based navigation which
means you want to create somehow

93
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.680 
paths through the entire search space that
guides you through collections like that.

94
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.400 
And of course every user might
have different needs to follow

95
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.450 
exactly his own path through the search
space. And this of course will be or

96
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.000 
is enabled and supported
by exploratory search.

97
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.480 
You might think, oh yeah, this is
quite of course science fiction too.

98
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.390 
However, it is not. There is an
example. You already know the

99
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.820 
scihi blog that we were talking
about, this blog about daily

100
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.250 
history of science and arts and
philosophy and that stuff. And this

101
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.810 
besides the semantic annotation
that I have already shown you

102
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.090 
also provides means of visualization
that enable exploratory search.

103
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.140 
So this was part of our researc.
Sso for example here if we go to

104
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.400 
the page in
scihi blog of

105
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.290 
Jules Verne there is an article
about him "Around the World

106
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.330 
in Eighty Days", also
another famous book.

107
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.590 
And here if you click on
Jules Verne what happens is

108
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.920 
tada, so you see here another
visualization which provides you

109
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.420 
interesting information about Jules
Verne. So you see here for example

110
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.190 
people in green that are somehow
related with Jules Verne.

111
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:43.150 
You see here in blue places, locations
associated with Jules Verne.

112
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.150 
You see in yellow points in time
which means events and here

113
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.010 
in purple all of the rest of
things that are somehow related

114
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.520 
with them and these are all things
which are somehow also reflected

115
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.840 
in the blocks, so in the information
system we are talking about.

116
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.610 
Now I'm going to show you
something interesting, so

117
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.730 
as soon as I move or hover over
one of these persons, so this

118
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.030 
is another author Italian
author called Emilio Salgari.

119
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.980 
This was also an author of adventure
and fantastic novels and

120
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.590 
you see here then automatically displayed
all the potential connections

121
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.780 
that are there between Jules Verne
and Emilio Salgari. So for example

122
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.000 
you might see that here

123
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:33.330 
Emilio Salgari has been influenced by Jules
Verne and overall you see also that

124
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.960 
Emilio Salgari for example is an
Italian, he wrote a notable

125
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.940 
work that is "The Black Corsair"
and he was born in Verona.

126
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.400 
We could look at other people
Phileas Fogg. That's of course a

127
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.390 
a fictional character created here
by Jules Verne in his famous

128
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.050 
novel "in eighty days, around the
world". Let's see what's else there.

129
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.440 
So I don't know
that guy.

130
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.950 
Norbert Casteret seems also to be
an author, Jean-Michel Cousteau;

131
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.960 
so what's the connection there?
Also is an influence connection.

132
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.350 
Konstantin Tsiokovsky, so this is one
of the fathers of space travel.

133
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.370 
So he also has been influenced as you
see here by Jules Verne. And these are

134
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.140 
of course connections and if you
are then interested in one

135
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.920 
of these other guys you simply
click on that and then you have

136
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.200 
this guy Constantine Tsiokovsky,
in the middle of the attention

137
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.300 
and of course you see also hear
how that guy might connected

138
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.710 
to Jules Verne or to other things. And
of course you get recommendations

139
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.720 
based on the content. So for
Constantine Tsiokovsky for example

140
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.520 
you see here as a second
suggestion Valentin Glushko.

141
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.780 
Who was valentin glushko? Also
some engineer that you see here

142
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.330 
who was one of the main
participants or main drivers of

143
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.910 
the space race between the US
and USSR in the nineteen

144
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.970 
sixty, seventy, eighty
's and so on.

145
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.150 
So this only as an example for exploratory
search because this enables you

146
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.650 
to explore the content of an
information system that you saw

147
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.550 
on the other side. And this is based
of course on semantic annotation

148
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.570 
and there is in the background
of course a knowledge graph.

149
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.300 
So let's see how this
works in principle.

150
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.300 
We have again our example from
the earth to the moon and of

151
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.220 
course we could use here now one
of the knowledge graphs that

152
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.780 
we already have used. So here for
example we will use DBpedia simply

153
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.780 
because you already know the self
speaking names and understand

154
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.480 
better the context
that we show.

155
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.720 
So what information is there for
the novel from the earth of

156
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.960 
the moon which is part of the
knowledge graph DBpedia?

157
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.030 
On the one hand you of course
find out that this is of RDF

158
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.090 
type book so this
is a book. Okay.

159
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.280 
You find out more interesting information,
for example, the previous work of

160
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.420 
whoever was here exactly "In Search of the
Castaways", another book of Jules Verne.

161
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.140 
So we here we have already in
relation which is interesting

162
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.310 
that can be used for a recommendation.
And of course you find

163
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:10.530 
other things like for example the
category, the wikipedia category

164
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.020 
in which exactly this subject
has been collected. So

165
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.670 
from the earth to the moon is in
the category eighteen sixty

166
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.470 
five novels or French science fiction
novels, novels by Jules Verne,

167
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.250 
moon in fiction, fictional rivalries,
novels set in Florida or eighteen

168
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.860 
sixties science fiction novels. So
lots of interesting categories that

169
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.820 
of course this book is in and it
might be interesting to see

170
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.530 
what other books are in exactly these
categories because this might lead you

171
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.090 
to your next favourite book
that you want to read.

172
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.920 
Let's have a look of course we also
know who is the author here and

173
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.190 
we get even more information you
know if you further follow

174
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.300 
you know the paths leading from
the author to other authors.

175
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.590 
You might find authors that have
been influenced by Jules Verne

176
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.780 
like for example HG Wells, another
science fiction writer, who

177
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.570 
wrote novels that might
be of interest for you.

178
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.650 
Okay we have to do this a bit more formally.
You see the principle already behind that.

179
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.200 
Here for example if I want to give a
recommendation which comes pretty close

180
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.770 
or is rather similar to the things
I have in mind, so I start

181
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.020 
always here with from the earth
to the moon, I look for things

182
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.610 
of the same type, which means I
look for other books. It doesn't

183
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.960 
make sense if I now look let's
say for a grocery store as a

184
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.030 
recommendation. I want to look
for other books. So the books

185
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.230 
I recommend should have the same
type and then I look for things

186
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.690 
which have the same type and are
somehow also via other links

187
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.260 
connected to exactly my original
item. And there you find the

188
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.340 
subsequent work and the previous
work of Jules Verne and this is

189
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.320 
a Journey to the Center of the Earth
or in Search of the Castaways

190
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.960 
which would be a recommendation
for you if you like From the

191
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.770 
Earth to the Moon.

192
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.760 
Now you might say yeah
that's quite nice but

193
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.340 
we have to relax this rule a bit because I
want to have more recommendations. Okay.

194
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.850 
We can also go the following way.
So you start from the book.

195
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.440 
You go to the author and then you
look to the author what other

196
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.950 
things of the same type this
author is connected with. So for

197
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.570 
example the author Jules Verne of
course is author of many more books

198
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.440 
and all these books of course are
of type books and are connected

199
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.550 
to Jules Verne via the property
author. So we have two

200
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.260 
equivalent property connections here
that might wait and the more there are

201
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.490 
the more similar are the things you
are looking for. So here for example

202
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.240 
now I could extend my recommendations
from these two I had

203
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.330 
in the beginning to also other books
like for example Matthias Sandorf

204
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.460 
Master of the World or
The Mysterious Island.

205
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.610 
Now you might say ok this is quite
easy. I only get other books

206
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.030 
of the same authors. So this is
something I could have done

207
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.740 
easily in another way. Okay, so let's
go one step further. You have

208
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.335 
already seen that for example we
can go one step further from our

209
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.930 
our author Jules Verne than to another
author which is here hg wells

210
00:14:00.335 --> 00:14:03.930 
author Jules Verne to another
author which is here HG Wells

211
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.920 
and we go the same principle that
we did in the beginning. We

212
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.830 
look for something you know of the
same type, so both are authors

213
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.000 
and they are connected via a property
which is your dbo:influenced.

214
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.640 
So therefore we think they are
connected, they are of the same

215
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.740 
type. Therefore they possess
sufficient similarity.

216
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.240 
And now I look of course again
for things of type book

217
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.990 
that are connected to now this new
item, which means here HG Wells

218
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.260 
and I find out again via simply
looking that there are similarities

219
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.440 
that for example HG Wells has
also the few books that might

220
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.860 
also be interesting for me. Like
for example The Invisible Man,

221
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.420 
The Island of Doctor Moreau
or the War of the Worlds.

222
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.750 
And this might be already interesting
recommendations. And exactly this

223
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.460 
you might use for writing your own
recommender system or for guiding the user

224
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.590 
through all the books that are
represented in your library or here

225
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:09.340 
in DBpedia. So we know now what
exploratory searches and recommender

226
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.900 
systems, what data is also clear they
seek to predict preferences of a user

227
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.480 
would give to an item that
we can recommend. So

228
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.640 
for example of course this means
personalized recommendation

229
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.920 
but there is also something if
you know nothing about the user

230
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.470 
if you have something like a cold
start problem then of course

231
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.310 
you go simply content-based and look
for similar or related things.

232
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.680 
We have now mostly looked for similarities
but also you can take into account

233
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.880 
relationships. We did this
here by looking you know not

234
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.390 
for books but first we went for
authors and then we went for

235
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.680 
related authors and then we went for
similar items for that related thing.

236
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:56.750 
So we combine here relationships and
similarities to generate recommendations

237
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.170 
from knowledge graphs.

238
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.250 
We have a very simple and very
easy recommender for you that

239
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.930 
is based on DBpedia. So there for
example I created a very short

240
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.660 
SPARQL query that
you see here.

241
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.500 
What I want to have is of course for
my book From the Earth to the Moon

242
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.670 
I want to have recommendations what
should I read according to DBpedia.

243
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.580 
And what I do is I simply look
for the most similar books

244
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.540 
in the sense here I have only
made the restriction because

245
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.770 
I otherwise might easily run into
a time out. There are so many

246
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.580 
books you know and SPARQL is
sometimes rather slow. So I simply

247
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.430 
look for the categories that we had in the
beginning because the categories rather

248
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:42.120 
well are able to represent the
content of a novel here.

249
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.710 
So I'll simply look for other novels that
share as many categories as possible

250
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.020 
with my book From the Earth to
the Moon. So what I do here in

251
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.120 
this SPARQL, query just have a look
at it I have prepared it here

252
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.420 
in the browser for you. So we have
to go back, then you see it here.

253
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.670 
So this is the query. We select
of course here this is the book

254
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.390 
we are looking for and then we
have here a score and what we

255
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.230 
are looking for patterns is
first of all we want to select

256
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.200 
all the categories in which From the
Earth to the Moon is in and then

257
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.470 
we say ok we select some
recommendation s that should share

258
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.470 
the same category and of course
I do not want to have the same

259
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.050 
book recommended that I already
read, so I simply filter out

260
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.460 
the book From the Earth to the
Moon from my results. I group

261
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.340 
all these results by the
recommendation and for that I count

262
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:40.100 
simply the number of distinct categories
they share with my original book.

263
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.480 
And then I order the thing
in a descending way by the

264
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.940 
score I achieve and then I run
the query and you see exactly

265
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.710 
what is the outcome. The book that
shares most categories with

266
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.160 
my book is Around the
Moon and I think

267
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.260 
this is, yeah, interesting. Of course it's
from Jule Verne and it's the sequel

268
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.080 
to From the Earth to the Moon.
So this is not bad you know.

269
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.600 
If i look for what to read next
then of course I should probably

270
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.230 
read the sequel. But as you see there
are also other recommendations

271
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.570 
Off on a Comet, for example,
or Apollo 23. So this is

272
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.510 
definitely not a book by Jules Verne.
Let's have a look what is apollo 23.

273
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.380 
That's a book from the
Doctor Who series.

274
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.770 
Quite interesting. So you see you
might play around with that

275
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.220 
and of course you might produce a
much more sophisticated SPARQL

276
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.080 
query which produces an even
better recommender system.

277
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.110 
Ok with that I leave you alone
now and let you play around.

278
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.540 
The point now is of course you
could of course extend this

279
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.610 
also to other items and what beside
book recommendation is interesting

280
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.150 
you have movie recommendations.
And now the question is

281
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.810 
which movie should
I watch next.

282
00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.710 
And of course never make boring
suggestions because in that case

283
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.760 
your recommender
system is busted.

284
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:12.910 
Ok that's it with the entire lecture. I
hope you have enjoyed these lectures.

285
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:19.150 
You know now much, a lot, more about knowledge
graphs and knowledge graph technology.

286
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:24.200 
We tried to give you a six week
program with everything which

287
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.220 
is interesting to know as a starter
with that kind of technology

288
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.900 
and of course now it's up to you to
deepen that knowledge. And we give you

289
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.570 
lots of pointers where you can
connect to if you, for example,

290
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.390 
want to broaden or deepen your knowledge toward,
let's say, knowledge graph programming,

291
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.940 
developing information systems based on
knowledge graphs or improving search systems

292
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.870 
or improving generating
visualizations and stuff like that

293
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.440 
all based on knowledge graphs
which are an emergent

294
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:59.070 
and by that time rather
popular technology. So thank

295
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.390 
you very much for your attention
and hope to see you again

296
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.340 
soon in some of my
next courses.

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.460 
Let's start with the basics
of encryption technology.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.780 
Cryptography was the
science of encryption

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.890 
and the idea behind, it is
a very efficient method

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.280 
for protecting the content of
messages. The content of measures

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.270 
from the unauthorised readers.
And the idea is simply by

6
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.990 
making the messages
unreadable

7
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.270 
for persons that do not
know how to decrypt

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.390 
the message. So with encryption the
message is converted,

9
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.850 
we speak of encrypted or
encoded into inllegible

10
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120 
string by means of an
encryption method,

11
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.600 
which only an authorized
recipient can convert back,

12
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.820 
so that the recipient can get
back the original message, but all

13
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.870 
the attackers that have access to the
message on the transportation

14
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.170 
way that they can get the message
but they do not understand.

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.110 
So to convert message into
such an unreadable string,

16
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.460 
illegible string is encryption
and to decrypt this illegible

17
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.920 
string into this original
message, this is decryption.

18
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.840 
So encryption and decryption methods
are parameter controlled,

19
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.490 
and the parameter in
that context is called

20
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.310 
a key, so by means of a
key or by means of keys

21
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.680 
the encryption methods
are controlled.

22
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.050 
Recipient is only able to
decrypt an encrypted message,

23
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.920 
by the way is encrypted
message is called " ciphers",

24
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.120 
the reciever can only decrypt
and encrypted message

25
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.170 
if they have access to
the decryption key

26
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.920 
that matches encryption key.
So only knowing the key one

27
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.260 
can use the encryption
or decryption methods

28
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.750 
in the right way. Cryptography
is a science of encryption.

29
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.110 
Today more commonly
understood as the science

30
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.730 
of information
security.

31
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.830 
The quality of encryption
methods depend on the extent

32
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.200 
to which it is possible
to decrypt the message

33
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.640 
without authorization, that means
without the matching decryption

34
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.330 
key. The strong encryption
makes it almost

35
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.490 
impossible for hackers to find out
to decrypt a message without

36
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.820 
a key. According to the efforts that
are needed to break encryption,

37
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.260 
we distinguish between weak
cryptographic methods and strong

38
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.700 
cryptographic methods. For strong
cryptographic methods it should

39
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.500 
be impossible in the time
frame of years to decades

40
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.330 
to decrypt a message. With
a weak cryptography

41
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.920 
is that often weaker methods,
for example, older methods

42
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.460 
which were designed and used
in time where the computers

43
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.640 
have less power.

44
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.870 
Cryptoanalysis is an
area of cryptography

45
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.440 
that examines the quality of
decryption techniques and possible

46
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.750 
attacks to break
and encryption.

47
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.690 
In order to get unauthorized
the knowledge of an encrypted

48
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.200 
information, an attacker must
intercept encrypted message

49
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.350 
to gert it, it is easily possible
to encrypt

50
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.830 
message when the cipher is
transported through the internet.

51
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.960 
And then the attacker has
to break encryption,

52
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.760 
that means he has to
execute more or less

53
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.230 
complex decryption method, because
he does not have possess the

54
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.750 
decryption key. So there are
methods, for example brute force

55
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.590 
methods brute force attacks
by which the attacker can try to

56
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.400 
break the encryption,
can try to decrypt the

57
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.340 
message and these
brute force attacks

58
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.630 
are not preventable,
because the attack consists

59
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.400 
of the idea that an
attacker simply tries

60
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.380 
systematically all possible
keys. All possible keys for

61
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.340 
decryption of the message
and going systematically

62
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.270 
through the the space
the key can be taken off,

63
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.440 
then at the end he or she
will find the right

64
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.940 
key. Brute force attack
is not preventable

65
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.640 
and brute force attack consists
of systematically testing

66
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.430 
all possible keys.

67
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.210 
So the difficulty of cracking an
encryption is therefore dependent

68
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.890 
on the key lengths, as the number
of possible keys is multiplied

69
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.810 
with the number of keys symbols with
each additional key character.

70
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.180 
Perhaps you remember
we had when we spoke

71
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.440 
about passwords in week
2, we also discussed this

72
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.090 
topic that the
longer the key is,

73
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.950 
the more difficult it this key to
perform this brute force attack.

74
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.490 
And this is not a linear
increase in complexity with each

75
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.060 
additional symbol,
it's an exponential

76
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.870 
increase in the computing
power that's needed

77
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.430 
to perform such
a brute force attack.

78
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:40.230 
The encryption technology is used
to achieve various security

79
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.300 
objectives, so one we already
discussed is confidentiality.

80
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.800 
Confidentiality guarantees
that only authorized person

81
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.720 
can access can understand
the information.

82
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.050 
But also integrity is an
important security goal

83
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.260 
that can be a achieved by
encryption techniques.

84
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.190 
And integrity means that the
data is protected from

85
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.870 
tampering. Authenticity

86
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.340 
is another security object
which consists of ensuring

87
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.710 
the origin of a message, so
it should be not possible

88
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.360 
for the attacker to falsify, to
fake, to manipulate a message

89
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.200 
when it runs over an open network
like the internet and it

90
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.310 
should be possible to find out who
is the sender of that message.

91
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.180 
Liability is another
security object that can

92
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.810 
be secured by encryption
technology.

93
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.610 
Liability has the security goal
that originator a message

94
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.970 
cannot deny its origin.

95
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.920 
Here is the important
for all the online

96
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.910 
shopping activities
and sending contracts

97
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:13.160 
over the internet. Now let's have
a closer look at the encryption

98
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.030 
methods themselves, so
they are classical

99
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.270 
cryptographic methods,
I mentioned already

100
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.340 
that cryptography

101
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.300 
is more than 2000 years old
in science.

102
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.890 
One idea is so-called transposition
and the idea consists that

103
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.160 
you have a word, you
have a text and by

104
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.910 
transposition there is a rearrangement
of letters in the word,

105
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.580 
in that sentence, in the text which
makes a word, sentence, text,

106
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:55.720 
unreadable. Substitution, that's
another method quite simple

107
00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.310 
method, and the idea here is
that the individual characters

108
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.960 
are replaced with other
characters with other letters.

109
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.300 
Modern cryptography
methods

110
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:19.370 
consist in using computer for this
encryption and so the procedures

111
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.670 
run on the bit level,
so the message is

112
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.820 
described in
a bit level

113
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.460 
by zeros and ones, and
then combinations

114
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.540 
of these bits are done and
this allows much more

115
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.820 
combinations than if we use letters.
Modern cryptographic methods

116
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:52.180 
are symmetrical one key methods,
this are characterized by a

117
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.080 
secret key and then there is
the family of other symmetric

118
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.580 
2-key methods which
are characterized by

119
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.370 
key pairs, a private
and a public key.

120
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.600 
So classical also
symmetrical

121
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.230 
one-key methods are known
but the asymmetric

122
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.370 
two-key methods that were
discovered and developed in

123
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.600 
the course of digitalisation
when computer science

124
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:31.090 
became, in the second part of the last century
an importance field

125
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.730 
with the creation of
computers. So in further

126
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.680 
clips we will have a closer
look on such symmetric and

127
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:45.170 
asymmetric procedures and
we will also see how this

128
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.070 
will be applied in security
protocols for the Internet.

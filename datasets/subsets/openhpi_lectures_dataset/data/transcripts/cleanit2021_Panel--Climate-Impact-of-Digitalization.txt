1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:12.019 
With this, I will now open the first panel: "Climate Impact of Digitalization" and as the first impulse, as the first panelist, I would like to welcome

2
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.300 
and ask for his input:

3
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:28.429 
Professor Doctor Dirk Messner. He is the President,since 2020, the President of the Federal Environmental Agency. He was previously director

4
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.649 
of the UN Institute for Environment and Human Security, Vice Director of the UN University and Director of the German Institute.

5
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.850 
for Development Policy, thus

6
00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.640 
he knows what he is talking about. We're glad to have them.

7
00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:50.850 
Maybe we'll do it that way after their impulse, if they're already going to the podium then, that we'll then follow up with

8
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.920 
when everyone has given their feedback, we can then start directly with the discussion. Thank you very much, Mr. Meinel, my very

9
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.750 
Ladies and gentlemen, dear Franziska, it's nice to see you live again, that's great.

10
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.950 
I'm speaking from three perspectives on the topic of digitization and sustainability: For a long time, I was a member of the scientific advisory board "globale

11
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.189 
Environmental Change", for ten years, and the last major report for which I was jointly responsible, that was on the

12
00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.409 
digitization and sustainability, because we found that the topic was not being dealt with at all, that these research

13
00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.120 
communities don't stand together at all, that we don't even know

14
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.549 
on the sustainability side where the potentials are, there is a lot to do. That's my first perspective of more scientific

15
00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:34.200 
Advisory Council "global environmental change", then in the Federal Environment Agency the State Secretary has just indicated that is digitization

16
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.549 
is an important topic for us.

17
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.409 
I've made that more important again, sort of in the last two years since I've been there now, because in this study we're

18
00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.329 
of the WBGU have shown that there is a lot of potential, generally not mobilized so I'm talking about missing links, we

19
00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.150 
have to create a lot of missing links between these potentials and what we actually want to solve.

20
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.170 
The third perspective I'm speaking from is an international perspective.

21
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.939 
We at the Federal Environment Agency have formed an international alliance with a number of other partners.

22
00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.269 
Mr. Meinel, we should also talk about that, I think that's very good, where we try to address this issue also on the global level

23
00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:08.509 
moving forward, because you talked about the SDGs.

24
00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.639 
The interesting thing is yes, when the SDGs were adopted in 2015 or, when we were discussing Paris

25
00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.599 
then also adopted this this autumn of multilateralism 2015,

26
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.189 
digitization didn't play a role at all.

27
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:29.639 
In this SDGs, you don't find this digitization mentioned at all, and we are arguing today, after all, with good reasons: "We

28
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.819 
will not be able to solve the SDGs without digitization."

29
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.990 
However, digitization, even if we don't align it properly, can lead to accelerating

30
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.400 
of the unsustainable growth patterns, so with even more force, so to speak, digitization can lead to growth spurts

31
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.870 
produce, which produce us even more climate problems, even more resource problems. Creating these links

32
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.530 
is very important to us.

33
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.449 
We work at the global level with UNDP together with UNEP together in the International Science Council.

34
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.340 
the Future Earth Alliance, is indeed the global sustainability research and in this context we advise the Secretary General

35
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.039 
of the United Nations to reinterpret and realign the SDGs from a digitization perspective.

36
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.159 
There is a process called Global Digital Cooperation, and we are involved in it with our network

37
00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.349 
to redefine the environmental dimension of digitalization, so to speak.

38
00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.020 
So we should definitely talk to each other because they are working on a lot of questions, a lot of issues that we are also

39
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.949 
play a role, and there is worthwhile, I think

40
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:35.189 
Cooperation. I would like to say something about three aspects and I think this fits well with what Mr. Meinel and the Secretary of State have already

41
00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:44.750 
have stated. From my perspective, from our perspective, on the one hand, we have to put "greening IT" first, which is basically

42
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.349 
the first necessary step that we have to take, so that digitization itself does not become a problem.

43
00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.639 
There you have the relevant numbers,

44
00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:59.939 
Mr. Meinel, called. "Greening IT," I'll say 2-3 sentences on that in a minute. The second point then is we have to try to better

45
00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:07.419 
understand where digital tools and digital innovations can become enablers to solve the problems that we face through the SDGs

46
00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:14.389 
described by the target system, i.e., "digital as an enabler, as a problem solver," and

47
00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.480 
there's still a lot of work to be done on how we can best use that so that we can be more effective in climate change mitigation in the

48
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.589 
resource issues and in the circularity of the economy, use these digital tools in a way that we can move faster.

49
00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:29.819 
That's the second dimension, "As an enabler." And the third dimension is,

50
00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:37.329 
if I look quite optimistically at the development, maybe that's the disruption that we're looking at in climate protection, Franziska,

51
00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:38.100 
have been waiting for.

52
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.699 
You pointed out: We are in a "decade.

53
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.660 
Factor Three." We've done 2% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per year over the last 10-15 years, 2%! We

54
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.060 
but now need 6%, towards 2030. tripling!

55
00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.490 
We will need to expand renewable factor 3 in this decade and continue like this in the next decade,

56
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:08.000 
Factor 3. If you look into building retrofits, also factor 3. So these technologies are the disruption and the

57
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.310 
potential that we can leverage to really move forward quickly here,

58
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.699 
and I would like to give you 2-3 thoughts on that as well. That's the basic structure and now just a few thoughts on each.

59
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.180 
The first point "Greening IT". There, in principle, I can only subscribe to what we have already heard.

60
00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:30.240 
At UBA, we are working very specifically on three issues at the moment: The first issue is the data centers, about that

61
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.449 
we have already talked about, the data centers. We did a study, from UBA where we looked at.

62
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.899 
The first important finding is: we don't know anything about the energy efficiency of the data centers, because we don't have any

63
00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:45.670 
standards, we don't have monitoring systems, so that's where standard meeting and regulation and benchmarking is needed,

64
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.660 
big field.

65
00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.139 
They also executed that

66
00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:54.180 
Mr. Meinel. We have found data centers with high energy efficiency, we have data centers

67
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.120 
found with incredibly poor energy efficiency, but there is no transparency in the market, we have no

68
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.379 
mechanisms there to provide competition, and we need those. The second field we're looking at, it's also already been addressed,

69
00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.269 
"Software," Franziska you brought that up, we work closely with you guys, that's where the problem is just like Mr. Meinel brought up the

70
00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:18.860 
describes, from our perspective. We don't have heuristics at all yet to measure the energy efficiency or the energy consumption of algorithms.

71
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.980 
and software in a really consistent way.

72
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.459 
That's why a number of research projects, one.

73
00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:31.519 
you just mentioned, Franziska, where we are looking at these issues of methodologies and heuristics for efficient

74
00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:39.550 
energy efficiency consideration of software. Then we'll look at digital tools and infrastructures and products.

75
00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:46.720 
The observation there is: a lot of the products that are digitally driven have very short life cycles and then you quickly end up

76
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.779 
with e-waste. Lifecycles,

77
00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:54.689 
and extending those life cycles on the one hand, and how do we advance circular economy so that we can

78
00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:00.839 
the resources that are consumed here can actually be recycled back into the digital business.

79
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.490 
Those are the big challenges that we have to deal with.

80
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.579 
And that's the UBA package that's going on there right now, so greening IT, that's the first dimension if we don't get that done,

81
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:17.560 
then we won't even get to the second step, which is "Digital as an enabler", irony of history, so to speak.

82
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.199 
We have great hope that these tools will help us unlock the potential in our economy that we need for

83
00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.040 
Climate action and circular economy.

84
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.810 
But first, we need to see the digital processes themselves become sustainable.

85
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:36.660 
So the potentials in the enabling area. Here I am very optimistic, I have to tell you, because almost all of the

86
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:43.040 
studies that are available show that the potentials, I'll sign off, potentials, not what we realize, the potentials

87
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:51.310 
of digital innovations and tools for decarbonization, for circular economy, for dematerialization, for monitoring.

88
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:57.439 
of ecosystem and therefore protection of ecosystems and then optimization in climate research itself.

89
00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:03.089 
As far as our models are concerned all these potentials are underlined in majority of the studies.

90
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.670 
So we have to lift those now.

91
00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:08.410 
I am optimistic in this dimension, we need incentive structures for this.

92
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:15.459 
As long as we have a tax system that essentially taxes labor and hardly taxes resources, we should not be surprised.

93
00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:19.589 
that digital innovation is being used to save labor, not resources.

94
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:25.779 
This is about appropriate incentive systems so that we can mobilize this potential. That's the second dimension, optimism

95
00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:30.379 
from my side and now the third dimension comes briefly and that brings me to the end,

96
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:39.149 
is that the disruption we need, so this can be a game changer, is it not just about containment

97
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:45.710 
of risk if we don't create Green IT, but is there a potential here that really sustainability transformation

98
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.029 
that we're all talking about with a new perspective.

99
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:54.340 
I think there's a great opportunity there, and I just want to outline that with two examples.

100
00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.190 
The first example is, we have, if we look at the large companies around the world, studies that show if you look at the

101
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.269 
largest 500,000 companies look.

102
00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:07.250 
40% of these companies now have a science-based climate strategy.

103
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.480 
That's good, it should be 100%, we're at 40.

104
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:20.519 
Of that 40%, only 5% are taking advantage of the opportunities of their climate strategies, with their AI strategies, which they are also pursuing, with a

105
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.759 
To combine with each other.

106
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:28.440 
That is in the companies themselves, even in the large companies around the world, have a parallelism of AI processes on the one hand

107
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.980 
and digital innovation and climate protection on the other hand, and so they can do what I just mentioned under enabling

108
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.990 
mobilize at all because of that. We had

109
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.279 
a few days ago, Franziska, with Robert Habeck and the Minister of Science and the Industry 4.0 platform,

110
00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:47.840 
about this, the discussion: how we in the companies can do this merging of climate orientation, climate strategy on the

111
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.399 
one side and digitalization, how we can better combine these. There's still a lot of potential there for Game

112
00:09:54.399 --> 00:10:01.690 
Changing, because the proportion of companies that have already systematically linked their digital strategies with climate strategies

113
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.799 
Is vanishingly small.

114
00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:07.350 
There's still a lot of room to go, there's a lot we can support from science.

115
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.460 
Politics can set the incentive systems, the companies themselves have to put this on the agenda.

116
00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:17.289 
And the second point I would like to conclude with now, this auditorium is exactly right and Mr. Meinel,

117
00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:23.769 
You have said everything that is relevant there, and I would just want to underscore it: We need to do research on the

118
00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:29.850 
digitization and research on climate neutrality, circularity, and sustainability together.

119
00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:35.549 
And there's an incredible amount of room to go up there as well because both of these research communities, you pointed out,

120
00:10:35.549 --> 00:10:39.240 
there's not even a journal for it, they're barely networked together yet.

121
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:45.460 
Now if I had some slides with me, at this point I usually show a slide with the highlights of the AI research

122
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:52.519 
of 2020/2021 from the international congresses of AI research. Then you can hardly believe when you see the top ten

123
00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:53.179 
Topics:

124
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.120 
But there's not a single one in the top 10 either,

125
00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:02.100 
that with our questions that we are discussing today "Greening IT", sustainability and digitalization, there is not a single one

126
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.889 
among them. So we still need to merge these two things also in the research area, and then we have great opportunities

127
00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:15.330 
not only to narrow down problems, "Greening IT", but to raise the enabeling potentials and maybe even to Game Changing

128
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.639 
Situations to come.

129
00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:24.419 
Thank you very much for your attention,

130
00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:32.679 
Mr. Messner, thank you very much, it is always a pleasure when a scientist also heads a federal agency, for the fireworks of ideas.

131
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.710 
May I ask the next panelist, Dr.

132
00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:49.190 
Bernhard Rohleder here on stage, he the was a founding member of Bitkom Verband der IT-Industrie in 99,

133
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.480 
has been the chief executive officer since then.

134
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.590 
Some people say Bitkom

135
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.850 
be

136
00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:02.019 
Rohleder, was previously in senior positions at the VDMA,

137
00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:05.950 
in the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics at ZF Friedrichshafen,

138
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:13.850 
please give their input. Mr. Meinel thank you very much, at this point I'm always almost under so much pressure to justify why I'm doing the

139
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.970 
been doing this for so long, but I can say it's a job that totally excites.

140
00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:23.639 
After all, we all don't just have one life, we have several lives, I also have two lives and the first life I worked on in the

141
00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:31.759 
Environmental research. I did my PhD on a topic that we're also talking about here 25 years ago and I was talking almost daily about

142
00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:37.940 
deja vu every year. At the Environmental Policy Research Unit, first reviewer at the time, was the Chairman of the International

143
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:43.600 
Panel on Climate Change, so issues that moved me at the time and that are now intertwined with this second passion, the

144
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.950 
digitization, can be brought together quite wonderfully. When I say deja vu, I mean it quite seriously, not only in my

145
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:56.779 
own academic training and now in my profession, but also in the topic of green IT, they just

146
00:12:56.779 --> 00:13:05.149 
addressed Mr. Messner. We have in 2007 for the Cebit, that used to be the world's largest trade fair, a few will be

147
00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:05.740 
know them.

148
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:14.149 
For the year 2008, the core theme sought the guiding theme, the guiding theme was "Green IT". 2008, so it's been almost 15 years now

149
00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:20.960 
and we built up a traditional office there as Bitkom, so there was really someone sitting there and typing, and we

150
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.789 
set up a digital office and ran electricity meters on the side for seven days over the duration of CeBit.

151
00:13:27.789 --> 00:13:29.549 
how much energy is consumed there.

152
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.070 
It was quite impressive numbers on that practice example. Did that really make a lot of difference?

153
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:43.600 
I would say no. We are discussing very similar issues today as we were 15 years ago, but with a very different drama

154
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.039 
Than we did back then.

155
00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:51.100 
And if you ask yourself, "What is the reason that less has moved than could have moved and should have moved?",

156
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.549 
then it certainly has to do with the speechlessness between these two worlds.

157
00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:03.710 
I still experienced this in the old federal government, at a round with Svenja Schulze it was about digitization of agriculture.

158
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.389 
We were the only business association sitting at the table. It was a small

159
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.669 
Round, all the environmental associations were there.

160
00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:17.019 
The farmer's association was not there and what I already noticed there was a lot of reservation from the area

161
00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:19.379 
of NGOs towards digitization.

162
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.960 
Not everybody really liked that at all when I talked about smart farming and talking about precision

163
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:32.539 
farming can reduce nitrate inputs to groundwater, because in many cases it's not just your own passion that's going to be reduced.

164
00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:38.120 
on climate and environmental protection, but because other lifestyles and other economic designs are also related to it.

165
00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:38.659 
connect.

166
00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:44.389 
I think we're in a situation now where we have to be extremely pragmatic about these issues and how we can

167
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:50.450 
need to think about: How do we manage to solve this most pressing problem that humanity has ever had, this most pressing

168
00:14:50.539 --> 00:14:57.909 
problem, and digitalization can perhaps also make a decisive contribution to this and, by the way, it can also help to solve this problem.

169
00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:02.490 
without leading to dangerous discussions about abandonment.

170
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:09.480 
We can make it in many areas, not everywhere, but with digitalization, that we maintain our standard of living

171
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.289 
possibly even improve it and still and protect the climate at the same time.

172
00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:20.470 
You have quoted the study, Ms. Brandner, that we as Bitkom have produced. We are also criticized for this study

173
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.889 
been.

174
00:15:20.889 --> 00:15:23.929 
That was so a little bit nicely calculated etc, so we have

175
00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:30.649 
there I can say yes, us as Bitkom very far taken back, we have only in order given, have the results

176
00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:34.509 
looked at. They were also partly surprising for us, I may also say that.

177
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:36.460 
We found out some impressive numbers.

178
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:45.210 
Accelerated digitization 151 megatons of savings by 2030. 41% contribution to more ambitious climate

179
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.950 
and savings targets that we have in Germany, that's impressive.

180
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.350 
Of course, there is also a separate footprint of digitization.

181
00:15:52.440 --> 00:16:00.419 
There is also a leverage, which is a factor of 5, so 5 times more CO2 or CO2 equivalent savings than own consumption.

182
00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:06.210 
There's one area where, in terms of footprint, digital can't really do much.

183
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:12.870 
We have to use the energy that's generated from resources as it's just available in the marketplace, and we can

184
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:17.250 
reduce the footprint where we buy other energy.

185
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:23.450 
You just described that, Mr. Meinel, renewable energy sources, are not so heavily developed right now that

186
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:31.159 
we would have 100% corresponding electricity and as long as that is the case, there is this competition for the resource regenerative

187
00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:37.470 
generated energy, and if that's where the big cash-rich companies come in, then of course those are the first ones,

188
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.950 
that pull there with an energy provider, and it's a renewable power that's missing elsewhere.

189
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:49.029 
But the footprint, I will say, can be significantly, can be significantly reduced by also changing the energy mix

190
00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:50.960 
in Germany.

191
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.279 
Which fills me with, for all my optimism, some concern,

192
00:16:56.289 --> 00:17:05.960 
that is the strong effort of policy makers to intervene in a very deep regulatory way in processes of the economy.

193
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:12.839 
I don't think it's going to work because we don't have the competence to really go in very deep at that point, in

194
00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:19.220 
the algorithms and then to make a reasonable decision, which algorithm is the right one in a

195
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.970 
overall perspective really

196
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:28.190 
the more climate- or resource-friendly algorithm compared to a corresponding competing algorithm.

197
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.609 
And to that extent, at this point, my plea would be for policy makers to focus, to focus on what they're particularly good at, the

198
00:17:34.609 --> 00:17:42.009 
framework and give very strong price signals to the market that the strongest signals that companies are receiving are

199
00:17:42.009 --> 00:17:49.720 
can they are much stronger than regulatory intervention, and when we set price signals, so when primarily resource consumption is

200
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.349 
becomes more expensive, then that automatically means that digitization becomes more competitive.

201
00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:58.099 
Small example fiber optic networks, copper networks.

202
00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:03.720 
We have relied on vectoring in Germany for a long time. Vectoring means I have to use an extremely large amount of energy to get through the same

203
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.549 
copper cable to bring a larger amount of bits and bytes.

204
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.150 
Fiber is the much more environmentally friendly technology.

205
00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:18.279 
There were wrong signals given by policy makers, in regulation, and at the same time energy was just way too cheap.

206
00:18:18.309 --> 00:18:18.579 
So

207
00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:26.130 
I personally look with some skepticism at the current discussion about heating costs, subsidies and about too high energy prices.

208
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.049 
It's actually exactly what we need.

209
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.819 
We need authentic prices on the primary

210
00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:33.359 
resources, that's what we need.

211
00:18:33.369 --> 00:18:40.410 
And then the economy is oriented out of self-interest, because companies always behave opportunistically, out of self-interest

212
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.940 
to these price signals and develops technologies that are particularly resource-efficient.

213
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.950 
The biggest opportunities we have are in the area of substituting digital power for physical power.

214
00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:53.700 
What we're doing here is a typical

215
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.569 
physical meeting.

216
00:18:54.569 --> 00:18:57.380 
I actually drove here in the car, I drive almost everything else

217
00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.869 
by bicycle. Got a little physical problem,

218
00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:01.640 
that's why it didn't work today.

219
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:09.160 
But of course it is much more resource consuming and intensive here than a video conference in the appropriate

220
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:16.950 
framework. Where we can substitute, that's where we're strongest, that's when we're most effective as a digital economy

221
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.819 
And make the biggest contribution,

222
00:19:19.829 --> 00:19:21.920 
in terms of climate protection and resource conservation.

223
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.890 
That would be my appeal also to future work, that we look very strongly,

224
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:32.140 
Digital twin is one such example, we have calculated that as well, that we look at where we can leverage physical power

225
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.440 
substitute with digital power and focus quite strongly on that.

226
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.250 
That should be it.

227
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:45.289 
For now I look forward to the discussion

228
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.599 
Many thanks

229
00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:56.150 
Mr. Rohleder. Next, I would like to welcome a colleague from Potsdam from the GFZ, the GFZ Earth System Modeling Section.

230
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:03.950 
here from the large-scale research institution Geo-Sciences, Professor Doktor Maik Thomas, please come in

231
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:15.089 
You. He has been leading this GFZ Earth System Modeling Section since 2007, and since 2013, he has also been a professor of fluid dynamics in Earth

232
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:17.319 
system at the FU Berlin.

233
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.950 
We look forward to your input.

234
00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:27.910 
Thank you very much for the introduction. Good morning to you. When I was kindly asked, here is something about the conference.

235
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.349 
to contribute, which of course I find from that exciting,

236
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:41.660 
initially thought well, can't say anything at all. I'm an oceanographer, I run mathematical models on observational data.

237
00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:49.650 
So I actually can't say much about the technical things, but what I might be able to present to you is why

238
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:56.960 
do we need digitization in the geosciences, specifically why do we need high performance there

239
00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.349 
Computing? Is that usable tool or is it more gimmicky?

240
00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:08.410 
So two examples that you all know so weather forecasting, there is

241
00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:14.130 
the meaningfulness, usually nobody questions, is based on models. With climate models

242
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:24.329 
well, there the opinion is not so very clear, but there are already discussions, but there are many other possible applications

243
00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:25.150 
for numerical models.

244
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.000 
These are only the two

245
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.440 
first ones, the most prominent ones.

246
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:35.259 
And I would like to show them where we use essentially numerical models at the Geoforschungszentrum in Potsdam.

247
00:21:36.339 --> 00:21:46.950 
So what we do, we confront our models with reality, with measured data. There are definitely modeling branches

248
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.210 
that don't need any reality at all.

249
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.920 
And now say that quite self-critical. But what we do,

250
00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:02.410 
we used numerical models to evaluate these various geodetic data and geophysical data. What they

251
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.500 
are seeing up there,

252
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:11.240 
what they see up there are different measurement systems: terrestrial, satellite based, sometimes airplane based

253
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.950 
supported so the diversity is very high.

254
00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:25.910 
These measurement systems are extremely precise, but the problem is they always measure the sum of an almost infinite number

255
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.160 
of processes acting simultaneously.

256
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.369 
So we say we have an integral signal, if they have an altimeter, that measures sea level, there they have

257
00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:39.789 
although a distance actually anrollende running time rather yes not and from that you say

258
00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:45.339 
the sea level is so and so high. So until you get there it's already a long way, but even if they know that, they know

259
00:22:45.339 --> 00:22:51.579 
still don't know, is there just more water in the ocean or it's gotten warmer or none of the above and just the bottom

260
00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:55.819 
has moved. And that's the same with many other systems, for example, the gravity field.

261
00:22:55.819 --> 00:23:02.279 
You may know the Potsdam potato from GFZ, so based on gravity field measurement for example with the satellite

262
00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:06.130 
Grace mission, which we run together with our American colleagues.

263
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:14.089 
But it's not until you unleash complementary methods on these observational data, that is, you first have to get the raw data

264
00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:20.180 
process, and you have to somehow develop methods to interpret this integral data, then they often come

265
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:26.049 
the quantities that we're actually interested in. Sea level change, groundwater storage changes, or what about

266
00:23:26.049 --> 00:23:27.549 
Ice mass changes?

267
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.890 
They need models for that.

268
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.809 
So if you abstract it a little bit, this is how you can represent it.

269
00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:38.660 
So we are in the process of contributing with models throughout the value chain.

270
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:44.799 
So starting with processing and cleaning observational data and ending with effect separation.

271
00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:47.859 
How do you get from knowing the sum the individual

272
00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:48.549 
summands?

273
00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:54.289 
Then, in terms of the causal processes, we can interpret the signal. Once we understand that, we can

274
00:23:54.289 --> 00:24:01.000 
by assimilation improve the models and then we have better production, better prediction and this

275
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.950 
prediction, which we can also use, among other things, to optimize, for example, future monitoring systems,

276
00:24:09.339 --> 00:24:16.150 
to optimize economically or in terms of output. So the applicability of numerical models is much more diverse.

277
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.069 
than is widely perceived by the public.

278
00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:21.259 
What is a numerical model, anyway?

279
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:30.599 
Can be explained quite simply, so first of all we summarize all that we think we have understood of the earth system

280
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:33.670 
or of climate dynamics in the form of equations.

281
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:39.160 
These then become so complicated so quickly that a closed analytical solution is no longer possible at all?.

282
00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:44.690 
We then call these data of these equation monsters nonlinear partial differential equations, which per se are not

283
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.029 
solvable, so what do you have to do?

284
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:52.130 
You just have to discretize them in time and space, and then you calculate for certain lattice-

285
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:58.789 
points the solution for certain parameters that are of interest at the moment. That's the basic approach, that is, they have

286
00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:07.480 
in space the variables and as a function of time, so four-dimensional. And it's clear that the quality of a

287
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.349 
of such a model of such a prediction depends on the model construct.

288
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:17.849 
How complex is the model, what processes are carried along, how it space-time resolution and how is the scalability

289
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.950 
In terms of computer architecture.

290
00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:31.170 
With all these parameters, of course, the resource requirements increase, in terms of CPU processing time and memory,

291
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.349 
all depending on that.

292
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:41.980 
So we're using these computer architectures to tickle the processes out of the Earth observation data that we've

293
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.160 
of interest for climate research.

294
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:52.180 
If we times it so few numbers here opposite is completely correct, us is not at all conscious:

295
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.509 
What do we actually consume with such a model?

296
00:25:54.579 --> 00:26:00.940 
Nobody asks that and it would be very difficult to know because it's very sensitive.

297
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:07.529 
Regarding the model design. I've included two examples here. It's the same American Earth system model.

298
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.269 
All configurations are the same, resolutions time step and so on.

299
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:18.759 
And the only thing that differentiates those is how you take atmospheric chemistry that just a tiny component and they're

300
00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:22.549 
see immediately there's computational time going through the roof.

301
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.990 
The whole model performance is different because you can compute on other kernels,

302
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:33.019 
and so on. That is, we can't even keep track of that as geoscientists, that is extremely sensitive, but what we

303
00:26:33.019 --> 00:26:39.349 
perceive, of course, is the demands, are getting bigger, despite all the development also in terms of hardware computing time-

304
00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:45.710 
demands are getting bigger, but also the memory space is getting bigger, if there is for example Climate Model Intercomparing Project

305
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.130 
stand out, so a single example and look at the development over time these are typically, also

306
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:56.680 
if these numbers terabytes are not so high nowadays, but that's just one model, we're talking about multi model ensembles,

307
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.660 
then that also goes up exponentially.

308
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:07.059 
I have also collected a few headlines to get a sense of how much is the resource requirement.

309
00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:08.759 
I don't even want to read them out one by one.

310
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:15.700 
Many examples Mr. Meienl has already brought much more concisely, just want to repeat This example with the data centers

311
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:22.210 
the demand for energy that it is comparable or the emission of CO2 is comparable to the entire aviation industry.

312
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:29.759 
But, and this is the last point, listed on this slide, the climate and earth sciences are massively dependent on

313
00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:32.980 
On computing and storage capacity.

314
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:38.690 
Storage capacity particularly in the context of Earth observation data. And you can now ask yourself, is the cost of all this

315
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.059 
worth it?

316
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:48.369 
That's why I want to show 2-3 example just now where we apply these model methods to tease out relevant quantities of the climate system.

317
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:56.650 
The first example is for example a gravity field measurement over Antarctica, you think there is

318
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.130 
not much, there is no vegetation, hardly any life and so on.

319
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:05.640 
And you now measure this trend in the gravity field that means there is a change in mass and in the early days of the Grace satellite there was

320
00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:08.369 
Publications in Nature, in Science and so on.

321
00:28:08.369 --> 00:28:13.920 
Where it was simply said: It's quite clear, you see a deficit of ice masses here in the western region

322
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:20.509 
in the eastern area an accumulation of ice masses, but one has not considered that one also has the dynamics of the solid earth

323
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:27.400 
and if you do that, then you see that this positive fraction in the eastern area is

324
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.440 
Land elevation.

325
00:28:28.569 --> 00:28:35.470 
And there's really only one deficit in the Amundsen Sea sector in the western area. so this same correction, that you have all the

326
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:42.410 
effects first, you can also do that in Greenland and then just look at what the signal of the ice looks like and

327
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:49.549 
this is shown here once for Greenland. And here you can see over the years how the ice masses change over time.

328
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.970 
In particular, deficits in the southeast area of Greenland and so on.

329
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.789 
They can then integrate all of that and they can then separate the total mass trend.

330
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:04.079 
But they can't do that if they don't apply complementary methods to the Earth observation data, because then they're going to have to

331
00:29:04.089 --> 00:29:12.029 
interpret things as ice mass change that are not ice mass change at all, and that's the kind of thing that you can in principle

332
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:16.500 
do with the water mass changes for the whole earth.

333
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:25.829 
We see, for example, what a signal in terms of the deformation of the time-varying water content on the continents

334
00:29:25.829 --> 00:29:32.380 
so the deformation causes this time variable water masses on the earth you can also convert that

335
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:40.140 
of course, shortly comes an example for Europe for Central Europe, in deficits of water masses and there you can visualize that

336
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.819 
what we all have experienced in the last summers, this water mass-

337
00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:47.259 
Deficit in central Europe.

338
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.349 
Now you can say, that's where I come to my last example.

339
00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:57.750 
Well, the resolution is nice for application purposes that you did that, but we can't do that much with it there

340
00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:04.299 
These are not even in the catchment area of water basins and for that we are now just using methods of artificial

341
00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:08.839 
intelligence. Not as complex as the examples they gave.

342
00:30:08.839 --> 00:30:13.609 
We also work in completely different levels, always depends: what kind of uncertainties do you allow?

343
00:30:13.619 --> 00:30:14.970 
How exactly do you want it?

344
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.069 
But that's a typical Grace signal,

345
00:30:17.069 --> 00:30:21.630 
What you see on the left side. You can't see anything there that actually the average person can do anything with.

346
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:28.900 
But if they unleash neural network artificial intelligence methods on this field, then they have a field like this

347
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.460 
is on the right-hand side, and of course you can do that for the whole time domain.

348
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:39.559 
At the top is, for example, something like the observation, which you can then obfuscate, and then you look at how does that react

349
00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:45.069 
System out of that with the artificial intelligence and that's the bottom and out of the match See, that works

350
00:30:45.069 --> 00:30:47.049 
quite well, although we only have one resolution like that.

351
00:30:47.049 --> 00:30:52.799 
On the left, you can work out very fine structures from it and that's just an economic aspect again because they then

352
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:58.470 
don't have to invest too much in sensor technology and in satellites, but also with such a coarse signal relatively much

353
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.549 
with such a coarse signal.

354
00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:06.490 
So what I just want to say is that models are not only used exclusively for prediction but we need them in all steps of the

355
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:14.849 
value chain: to process, to interpret Earth observation data, but also to estimate uncertainties.

356
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:24.890 
Since the requirement for computation time and storage space depend very much on the complexity of a

357
00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.529 
Model, on the resolution and many other parameters.

358
00:31:27.839 --> 00:31:31.160 
And I leave you now: Is it worth it?

359
00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:39.839 
Thank you very much.

360
00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:48.349 
Thank you very much, dear Mr. Thomas, great mixture, which we now want to complete with Oliver Süme.

361
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:58.450 
He is the Chairman of the Board of the eco Association for the Internet Economy, run the world's largest Internet node and look after

362
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.759 
take care of all issues concerning the Internet economy.

363
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:10.420 
He himself is a lawyer with Fieldfisher in Hamburg and was previously president of the provider association

364
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.660 
EuroISPA to mention that as well. Mr. Süme please your input.

365
00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:16.599 
Thank you very much for the kind introduction,

366
00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:19.279 
Prof meinel. I am pleased to be here today.

367
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:25.140 
You have already briefly introduced the Eco Association, for which I am speaking here, and you have mentioned DE-CIX in particular.

368
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:31.759 
That is particularly a special feature for us as an association, that we are not only stakeholders of companies,

369
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:38.779 
but with DE-CIX as a wholly owned subsidiary, we ourselves are also a central component of the Internet infrastructure.

370
00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:41.160 
not only in Germany, but worldwide.

371
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.450 
DE-CIX now operates such Internet exchange points at 22 locations worldwide.

372
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:54.470 
And to that extent, we are particularly, of course, a welcome customer of data centers, data center operators.

373
00:32:54.470 --> 00:33:01.349 
That's why the data center industry is particularly close to our hearts, and it's already the subject of various comments today.

374
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.220 
have been.

375
00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:10.829 
By the way, we can read quite well at DE-CIX what is happening in terms of digitization, because of course we see the data throughput there,

376
00:33:10.829 --> 00:33:18.480 
that is happening in Germany in general. We assume that about 95% of the total traffic that happens in Germany is

377
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:25.759 
is coming through this DE-CIX node in Frankfurt am Main, distributed to different data centers there, that that's going through there.

378
00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:33.049 
if you look at what happens especially in the pandemic years in the lock down and home office phases at the DE-CIX

379
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:35.519 
is, then this speaks a quite clear language.

380
00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:45.279 
We have seen 20% more data throughput, data growth at DE-CIX in 2021, and of course that's due to

381
00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:52.940 
to the framework conditions, which we all know, digital infrastructures, digital applications were used intensively.

382
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:59.019 
That has yes also a very positive effect in digitization booster, which we like to talk about, and it shows just

383
00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:01.680 
then also in the data throughput at DE-CIX.

384
00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:08.679 
We just detected a new all-time peak now in February, we measure the data throughput there per

385
00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:17.469 
second and in February we measured 11 terabytes per second data throughput for the first time. To give you an idea of that

386
00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:24.820 
that corresponds to about 2.4 billion written DIN A 4 sheets per second, mind you, if you were to stack it up

387
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:29.619 
they would come to a height of 240 kilometers, that happens there per second.

388
00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:37.789 
And that shows of course digitization is data intensive and digitization and especially data centers need energy

389
00:34:37.789 --> 00:34:47.690 
that's clear, but digitization above all also contributes to less CO2 emissions in many areas.

390
00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.500 
energy consumption.

391
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:57.449 
The overall life cycle assessment, I think it's important to emphasize, of digitalization is quite positive, there are numerous

392
00:34:57.449 --> 00:34:58.079 
examples.

393
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:05.070 
Let's take the one that has probably affected all of us: Working from home, in other words, the failure to require

394
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:12.199 
to drive or take public transportation to the offices to work has had a

395
00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:15.099 
enormous CO2 emission saved.

396
00:35:15.099 --> 00:35:23.280 
Just one day of home office per day, there's a study by Greenpeace on this, saves about 1.6 or 1.8 million metric tons

397
00:35:23.289 --> 00:35:26.269 
CO2 emissions per year.

398
00:35:26.269 --> 00:35:32.679 
These are things that we can save on, but also especially when we look at digital applications in industry

399
00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:39.750 
particularly in manufacturing also there are studies that say by consistently using digital

400
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:46.550 
applications in production, we can create resource savings of up to ten billion euros per year.

401
00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:54.320 
And of course these are also processes where we can become more efficient in production, in the maintenance of production processes.

402
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.750 
and that also saves energy and that can of course be expanded and that must also be the goal.

403
00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:08.440 
Crucially, of course, the digital infrastructures themselves also have energy saving potential, and considerable potential.

404
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:16.409 
Mr. Rohleder mentioned it earlier, comparing copper technology to fiber. That is true to a similar degree, by the way.

405
00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:18.070 
for the cellular standards as well.

406
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:25.010 
Switching from 5G to 4G saves 80% energy compared to the old standard when they compare it to 3G

407
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:35.099 
98% so also in the infrastructure application itself through innovation and latest technologies in digital infrastructure

408
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:43.309 
we have quite considerable savings potential and that is something that we should make much more use of in the future. by the way

409
00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:47.780 
also the move of many companies to the cloud, which is still far from complete.

410
00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:53.840 
Many companies, especially in the midmarket, are still working on their local, self-operated infrastructures.

411
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.010 
Is actually an absolute madness in terms of energy.

412
00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:03.489 
When you move to the cloud, no matter which major provider, you save up to 80% of the energy that you would normally spend on

413
00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:12.230 
costs on the clock if you run that as an enterprise yourself, so significant potential there as well. if we look at

414
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:18.260 
take a closer look at the data center industry, then of course, Ms. Brandner

415
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.079 
they also said it,

416
00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:25.880 
of course this industry needs energy, but you also have to know that fortunately in Germany we already have

417
00:37:25.889 --> 00:37:31.940 
in a global comparison, especially in a European comparison, we are among the most energy-efficient data center operators.

418
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.309 
include.

419
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:39.599 
We are very far ahead there, of course there is still room for improvement, and above all we are also very far ahead in the

420
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:45.239 
Innovation of the computing processes that take place there. If we look at the development since 2015

421
00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:55.760 
then we've used 12 times less energy per workload since then than we did in 2010, because of course what's going on there in

422
00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:03.579 
the data centers, the computing processes, which are of course indispensable for digitization, are being optimized further and further.

423
00:38:03.579 --> 00:38:05.239 
are becoming more and more efficient.

424
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:11.900 
And that's a path that we want to continue to follow, of course, and to that extent we're very excited about the legislative announcement,

425
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:17.739 
Ms. Brantner, outlined this earlier, we are looking forward to being able to contribute with that.

426
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.989 
Keyword waste heat has been dropped.

427
00:38:20.989 --> 00:38:28.030 
I think that in particular is a great potential that this industry has the data center industry, and we

428
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:32.750 
already have incredibly great best practices for what's possible.

429
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:39.840 
We know because we are located there just as DE-CIX, especially in the Frankfurt market very well, that is the largest data center

430
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:48.170 
density that you can find in Germany and there are various best practices there including the building complex

431
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:56.199 
Eurotheum, which is already saving up to 40% in energy costs today with the help of data center waste heat.

432
00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:03.940 
70% of the waste heat from the data center is used to heat this building complex.

433
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:09.909 
And if we look at the potential of the data center industry as a whole in Germany, it shows how

434
00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:12.250 
high the potential for this waste heat utilization is.

435
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:18.769 
We have about 50,000 data centers, in Germany there are also many small ones, but also large ones, as we have them

436
00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:19.920 
in Frankfurt.

437
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:27.659 
If we were to consistently use this potential in Frankfurt alone as waste heat by 2030, then theoretically they could be

438
00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:32.750 
heat all office and private buildings in Frankfurt with data center waste heat.

439
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.329 
That shows the potential of that.

440
00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:45.480 
And to that extent, consistent waste heat recovery is indeed a very crucial key and a contribution that this industry

441
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.940 
can make to operate energy efficiently and with less CO2 emissions.

442
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:55.969 
The big question now, of course, is: How do we do that, which set screws do we need to turn?

443
00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:03.429 
Ms. Brantner, you talked about a registry and transparency for the energy efficiency of the data center industry.

444
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.929 
make.

445
00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:13.139 
I think first and foremost, we have to realize that if we're going to use this consistently, of course, it's going to require the

446
00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:15.539 
Data Center industry can't do it alone.

447
00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:20.849 
We're data center operators, we're not energy suppliers by design, so that means we're obviously focused on the

448
00:40:20.849 --> 00:40:27.429 
exchange and cooperation also on a technical level with the network operators, with the municipalities.

449
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.820 
We can tell them what's coming out in terms of waste heat.

450
00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:37.070 
But how it is then technically fed in, into the local supply or even into the district heating which technical prerequisites

451
00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:42.500 
are required within the grid companies and the grid infrastructure in the energy sector,

452
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:48.769 
that is, of course, beyond our expertise, so it's very important that we get the key players here early on

453
00:40:48.769 --> 00:40:51.090 
together and think about it and discuss it.

454
00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:58.039 
Where are there obstacles, where do we need to work out solutions together and to that joint dialogue,

455
00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:03.260 
in which we must above all also involve the municipalities, because after all, they are the ones who decide on this later:

456
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:08.519 
What is being fed into my network in terms of district heating or data center waste heat?

457
00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:15.099 
There will also be a need for dialogue in that as a federal legislature they can't regulate that at all

458
00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:19.590 
How the municipalities feed their energy into the grids there.

459
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:28.130 
In that respect, we hope to have early multi-stakeholder dialogue across the board that all stakeholders can engage in

460
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:31.730 
I think that's an important key to success in this area.

461
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.269 
What else is important?

462
00:41:33.269 --> 00:41:35.130 
Standards have been addressed.

463
00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.519 
Of course, standards play a crucial role in this area as well.

464
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:45.550 
I advocate that and I think that's quite an important criterion for success:

465
00:41:45.559 --> 00:41:52.579 
Let's think about this in a European way, please. There are good standards, there are approaches where we have standards also in the energy efficiency

466
00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:56.130 
Area also in waste heat utilization can be expanded.

467
00:41:56.139 --> 00:42:01.309 
But let's not make the mistake of retreating to German standards.

468
00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:08.389 
The competition for digitization and also for digital infrastructure is a European one and we are not doing a

469
00:42:08.389 --> 00:42:15.460 
favor by chaining the German data center industry to a German island standard, and the competition

470
00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.989 
in nearby foreign countries can operate on completely different terms.

471
00:42:19.019 --> 00:42:27.539 
In this respect, this has to be a European approach, and in this context, I would also like to mention normally the GAIAX project

472
00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:34.519 
which can perhaps also be an approach to be able to say here I am not only establishing data protection and security standards

473
00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:40.099 
and standards for the secure exchange of data between different industry sectors, but possibly

474
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:44.110 
also standards for energy-efficient use of data sharing.

475
00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.010 
In building data spaces.

476
00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:52.219 
So that can also be an approach and it would be a good one in that it's a European one.

477
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:58.989 
Yes, these are, I think, adjusting screws that can be turned and that should be it.

478
00:42:58.989 --> 00:43:00.150 
Now I'm looking forward to the discussion.

479
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:07.289 
Thank you very much.

480
00:43:07.289 --> 00:43:14.250 
Thank you very much Mr. Süme, thank you very much gentlemen, that was a firework of different ideas, approaches and possibilities,

481
00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:15.510 
that we have.

482
00:43:18.699 --> 00:43:24.840 
Thank you very much, mrs. brantner, for being there.

483
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:30.099 
take care

484
00:43:30.099 --> 00:43:32.159 
to start in a very concrete way

485
00:43:32.389 --> 00:43:43.599 
You mentioned that little bit in code, Mr. Messner with certification software, "blue angel for software" might be

486
00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:51.730 
that you explain that a little bit and then I would be interested in the reactions also especially from the from the economic sectors like

487
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:55.219 
that is seen, what do they have before that or how far along is that?

488
00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:03.909 
We have shown that for an enormous potentiality in the digitalization see in the energy efficiency area to move forward

489
00:44:03.909 --> 00:44:08.670 
in terms of climate neutrality to race ahead, circularity to progress and make and so on.

490
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:14.019 
And at the same time, we have to observe that the potentials are not self-perpetuating, so the question is at which set screws

491
00:44:14.019 --> 00:44:16.019 
can we turn to move forward?

492
00:44:16.019 --> 00:44:17.659 
Have mentioned a number of adjusting screws.

493
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.269 
That starts with research.

494
00:44:19.269 --> 00:44:21.300 
You also addressed that Mr. Meinel.

495
00:44:21.389 --> 00:44:25.829 
That goes on with the companies, the companies need to develop an awareness of that.

496
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:31.019 
And I had brought, yes, the examples of the big companies around the world that don't even see AI and climate together yet

497
00:44:31.179 --> 00:44:33.510 
The companies themselves need to look in new directions.

498
00:44:33.809 --> 00:44:38.250 
And then, of course, at the end of the day, the question is: What can we do about political

499
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:46.739 
framework conditions to create in order to support the processes, and

500
00:44:46.739 --> 00:44:51.489 
what we are doing at UBA in terms of the software issue in terms of

501
00:44:51.489 --> 00:44:55.489 
...

502
00:44:55.489 --> 00:45:03.760 
Is that we develop heuristics to make data centers comparable with each other, so you create transparency

503
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.989 
and by creating transparency, you also create competition. When you have created such transparency

504
00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:15.059 
you can then also think about energy efficiency standards. We can send companies on certain paths, so to speak.

505
00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.800 
in order to then get a corresponding orientation here.

506
00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:22.150 
And then I found the point Mr. Rohleder, which you have addressed very important, about which of course in our house also

507
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.190 
a lot of thought is being given to it.

508
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:29.500 
What are the monetary incentives to make sure that we're using the technologies in the right direction, and that's where I completely underscore

509
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.949 
the point that they made.

510
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:39.760 
If we enacted tax reform that adequately taxed resources and was based on taxing the labor

511
00:45:39.769 --> 00:45:44.920 
side reduced, then of course we would get a corresponding direction of technological development, a use of these

512
00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:51.090 
technological potentials so what we're doing at our UBA is we're trying to make the regulatory and the standard

513
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:56.599 
oriented instruments that we can use to actually mobilize the potentials that we agree on

514
00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:59.710 
Can through appropriate frameworks.

515
00:46:00.949 --> 00:46:02.090 
Mr. Rohleder, what would you like to see?

516
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.329 
Glad to follow up on the last point.

517
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:09.460 
I think it is quite difficult.

518
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.000 
There are studies, ecological rucksack of a yogurt-.

519
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.519 
Cup, that's been researched, that was hard enough.

520
00:46:16.519 --> 00:46:16.730 
Or

521
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.760 
what are the most environmentally and resource friendly milk packaging?

522
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.400 
But now they're trying to actually calculate the environmental impact of software.

523
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:31.230 
I think it's important to create as much transparency as possible and generate strong price signals, and when they create transparency

524
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:37.099 
have, that is, as a commercial customer, as an administration, as a residential consumer, I know what costs are

525
00:46:37.099 --> 00:46:38.570 
what consequential costs are generated

526
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.230 
the use of a product of a solution, a software.

527
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:49.710 
I know that, then I know what does it cost me in the sense what does it cost me for energy or what does it cost me for disposal

528
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:56.400 
And then I behave opportunistically ecologically reasonable and what is missing is the transparency we don't have.

529
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.489 
And what is lost by too much intervention in the market is authentic price signals.

530
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:11.500 
So I share that, I'm not in favor of as fine a regulation as possible, I'm in favor of as much as possible

531
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.019 
transparent.

532
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:17.309 
We need transparency on the side of the polluters, have talked about data centers, where we are at the moment at all

533
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:22.769 
don't have an overview of what the efficiency standards are across the market, that's where we need transparency, because then we need

534
00:47:22.769 --> 00:47:23.960 
we need clear price signals.

535
00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.469 
We should not make the mistake now in this sector that we made when we invented the circular economy. At

536
00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:32.409 
the invention of the circular economy, we started the waste management sector.

537
00:47:32.409 --> 00:47:39.409 
Have built a very expensive waste disposal and recycling system, while the mountains of waste in front and the material flows further

538
00:47:39.409 --> 00:47:45.460 
have grown. So instead of starting at the front and setting the price signals there, we've started from the back.

539
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:51.800 
So we should see that we develop lean regulatory systems, but so far we have a high level of non-transparency.

540
00:47:51.809 --> 00:47:52.809 
in these markets,

541
00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:54.900 
that we're talking about and we need to eliminate.

542
00:47:56.579 --> 00:48:01.949 
If I times this problem, if we say to our young people: here think please in the development of software and

543
00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:11.449 
IT system also this issue of energy consumption with, they actually have no real chance to see what they do

544
00:48:11.449 --> 00:48:13.579 
have to or what's good and what's bad?

545
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.630 
That's a very big problem.

546
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:22.239 
Of course software on hardware, operating systems, the technology is right on top of it, then it runs and that abstracting

547
00:48:22.239 --> 00:48:30.639 
from what's under there. Do you see any chances there with any labs with any approaches?

548
00:48:30.639 --> 00:48:39.409 
We also did yesterday with, coming up later as a speaker from VMWare also with the virtual machines where you might be

549
00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:49.170 
then also such things can test, that the developers can really try hands-on and somehow also structured say:

550
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:56.489 
yes, that's with these two ways of doing something, the better one to achieve efficiency in terms of energy demand.

551
00:48:57.469 --> 00:49:03.750 
We're doing studies right now where we're looking at whether there can be metrics, heuristics that we can use to guide together

552
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.989 
CAN.

553
00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:09.719 
You can be sure, there is not something given, which is based on a study of the UBA, but at the end of the day

554
00:49:09.889 --> 00:49:15.019 
we want to throw a stone in the water to be able to think about this question systematically so that companies can

555
00:49:15.019 --> 00:49:21.750 
or developers, so enterprise level and the developers level have any orientation at all in which they can

556
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.119 
can align.

557
00:49:23.539 --> 00:49:28.349 
And that is, after all, the basis for subsequently making good corporate decisions good investment decisions. For

558
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:30.090 
who give another example: We are

559
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.730 
For 2-3 years in the very structured dialogue with the industry-

560
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:38.599 
4.0 platform and have tried to understand where the disruptive potentials are via use cases?

561
00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:41.090 
And here's the emphasis again.

562
00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:44.860 
What's important is that the companies themselves start looking this way, so the industry-.

563
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:50.550 
4.0 platform did not have sustainability and climate neutrality on the screen at all in the first years of its existence, the

564
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:56.869 
was supposed to be a waste product, but digitization doesn't have climate neutrality as a waste product, you have to have climate

565
00:49:56.869 --> 00:50:00.599 
Neutrality and energy perspective as part of the business model.

566
00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:05.780 
These perspective changes, they are important, they can come from the companies themselves, there has been a change now

567
00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.030 
there has been, that's very good.

568
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.969 
But of course, they can also be supported by policy accordingly by energy standards, by CO2 prices and so forth

569
00:50:12.969 --> 00:50:13.440 
can be supported.

570
00:50:13.449 --> 00:50:17.699 
And that interaction, we need that now. Now I have described a little bit our needs

571
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:25.179 
in the development of IT systems, then our colleagues from the GFZ are in the use of these IT systems.

572
00:50:25.659 --> 00:50:32.849 
So you can't ask them to think about whether this model is more profitable this way or that way, but

573
00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:42.099 
they must be able to rely on the fact that these things that are made available to them also have a good balance sheet

574
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:43.380 
How can you help with that?

575
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:52.210 
Because so asking the GFZ to care... they are fully challenged to develop the models in the process

576
00:50:52.219 --> 00:50:57.690 
and to verify now down below to take care of the energy efficiency of the data centers,

577
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:06.460 
I think that would be overkill. If I can just say something about that, it would be a misconception to think that we have a lot of commercial

578
00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:12.679 
software. Then it would hit exactly that problem, with commercial software that is used operationally

579
00:51:13.139 --> 00:51:16.949 
That's where we have to rely on others. All the things that I presented earlier,

580
00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:22.789 
But are basically based on software that is developed within the community, so partly in our group

581
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:30.110 
but also in cooperation with international colleagues and there it is of course even more difficult to create a standard,

582
00:51:30.429 --> 00:51:37.400 
because these models are always in flux, they always have to be adapted and how to introduce a standard is not clear.

583
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:43.179 
to me is a mystery, especially if you also demand this from your doctoral students, who are only paid for their work.

584
00:51:43.179 --> 00:51:47.880 
what comes out and not how it comes out and you need an international solution.

585
00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:58.309 
What would certainly be a completely wrong perspective would be to say the end users now for now , because you use

586
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.889 
components,

587
00:51:58.889 --> 00:52:06.159 
You use software, so now to impose that on the end consumer and end user, the problem of carbon neutrality

588
00:52:06.159 --> 00:52:09.739 
at the end of the chain, so to speak, is complete nonsense.

589
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:15.010 
So if we look at that, if we look at that sector as a whole, so the examples that they brought show how important

590
00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:21.889 
it is that we harness the potential of AI, machine learning in that context so that we can get better at understanding

591
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:27.599 
of the earth systems and the climate systems in the interaction with the social system, so we should be

592
00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:31.449 
absolutely continue there, because they asked: Is it worth it? Is it worth it?

593
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:37.869 
My answer would be: of course it's useful. But we need a framework for the whole sector.

594
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:45.599 
Are three core elements central, the first is: so that the data centers that are at the beginning of the of the data processing.

595
00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:47.630 
so that the data centers can become carbon neutral,

596
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:53.539 
first of all, it is important that we are dealing with 100% renewables, that is the basis that the energy,

597
00:52:53.539 --> 00:52:56.969 
that is consumed is also carbon neutral. that the first point. the second point.

598
00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.400 
Franziska Brantner had also rightly addressed that.

599
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:06.500 
Energy efficiency remains an important point, because we have such high requirements for the expansion of renewables, if

600
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:12.059 
they think about all the sector coupling potentials, that it's not arbitrary how much electricity we use, so

601
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:17.960 
in addition to the renewable dimension towards 100, we need to continue to have energy efficiency and in data centers we have seen

602
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:22.380 
we don't even have an overview of how much energy is being consumed there. The data centers have, that partly still themselves

603
00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.559 
not even developed for themselves.

604
00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:29.570 
Energy efficiency, there you can work with standards. Comes a 3rd element to that, if you look at the whole sector and

605
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:35.489 
the data centers first of all, we also have a high resource consumption in the area of

606
00:53:35.489 --> 00:53:42.070 
digital innovations, and that's why circularity and circular economy is of great importance, so that we can get through

607
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:48.900 
the efficiency potentials that we tap into, in terms of energy, we don't subsequently have rebound effects via the increased

608
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:55.039 
resource consumption, which in turn leads to energy consumption, so renewable energy, energy efficiency, and circuli-

609
00:53:55.039 --> 00:54:01.659 
tat in terms of resources that's the guiding principle that we should be moving towards. maybe once I can go to the first one

610
00:54:01.659 --> 00:54:06.639 
point briefly, because of course that is indeed one of the biggest challenges for the industry.

611
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:11.820 
We all know that at the moment there are not available these renewables to the extent.

612
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.480 
Right now I think it's 42%.

613
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:17.460 
about less than half of the electricity share is just renewables.

614
00:54:17.639 --> 00:54:24.710 
Even if we expand that to 80% in the next few years, that just doesn't run in parallel with the targets that the legislature is setting

615
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:31.150 
to the ICT industry and also to the data center operators, namely to be climate neutral by 2030 according to the Green Deal.

616
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.050 
completely.

617
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:41.960 
The federal government says in its coalition agreement even new data centers must be operated climate neutral from 2027/28 already

618
00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.510 
will be.

619
00:54:43.539 --> 00:54:49.809 
And so I'm wondering how that's going to work then, if we're going to be using renewables particularly in the short

620
00:54:49.809 --> 00:54:59.380 
period until 2027/2028, we can't even expand as much as we need to for the required consumption of such renewables.

621
00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.260 
Energies by the data center industry will require.

622
00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:08.059 
So, we have a tradeoff there somewhere, and I'm curious how we're going to resolve that first of all, we need to

623
00:55:08.059 --> 00:55:15.949 
solve it in such a way that at the same time we ensure the competitiveness of the data center industry, of the digital infrastructure

624
00:55:15.949 --> 00:55:21.570 
overall, the business models, the innovations that we need to continue to develop in order to remain competitive, in the eye

625
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:29.869 
and not reduce ourselves too one-sidedly only to the achievement of such goals and completely disregard what is otherwise

626
00:55:29.869 --> 00:55:33.849 
is still happening in competition in this industry, so that's a big challenge.

627
00:55:34.969 --> 00:55:42.519 
My response to that would be, we have climate targets, and I hope we have a consensus there, because if

628
00:55:42.519 --> 00:55:43.909 
we don't submit those climate targets,

629
00:55:43.909 --> 00:55:44.769 
That's what they've shown,

630
00:55:44.769 --> 00:55:47.250 
After all, I come from the social and sociological sciences.

631
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:51.869 
Climate science, if we don't meet these climate targets, we're going to get into really rough waters.

632
00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:58.079 
That's why we have these challenging target systems that we're working hard on now and that's where we have to take responsibility now from the

633
00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:03.579 
perspective of different actors and that a responsibility lies with whom the framework conditions make

634
00:56:03.579 --> 00:56:08.199 
I have just said some of the things that would be necessary, in which direction we have to go there, and while that is happening

635
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.309 
But the companies but also public institutions have to,

636
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:15.829 
I'll say something about my own institution in a minute, we also have to get going, while the framework conditions are

637
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:16.889 
are still emerging, so to speak.

638
00:56:16.889 --> 00:56:18.000 
That has to run in parallel.

639
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.949 
You should not wait as a company.

640
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:23.949 
I think we have discussed Mr. Rohleder a time or two.

641
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:29.849 
They should not wait as a company until the regulations are there that push them in the certain direction

642
00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:35.059 
but they can, after all, approach things on their own initiative and in the Industry 4.0 platform we have this

643
00:56:35.059 --> 00:56:40.920 
discussion now from the corporate perspective, they are taking that on board, they are trying to make that part of their business models

644
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.340 
to make.

645
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:47.480 
When I just said in my presentation only a small percentage of large companies are bringing AI digitization

646
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:52.510 
with climate neutrality in their own companies so far at all together, then there's still a lot of

647
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:54.929 
Scope to go ahead and run things.

648
00:56:54.929 --> 00:56:59.079 
So, we haven't reached an optimal standard in the companies already and we have to, that's a little bit more

649
00:56:59.079 --> 00:57:04.360 
Finetune through incentive structures, but we have to develop incentive structures and in parallel, the companies must

650
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:09.610 
part of their business model, and all the data shows us there's still a lot of room to go up. so I don't

651
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:10.840 
just finger pointing.

652
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:16.409 
We want to build a climate neutral, public administration, build climate neutral research and that's where we work in all

653
00:57:16.409 --> 00:57:20.599 
their institutions at the universities and also at the Federal Environment Agency on strategies on how we do that.

654
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.989 
And it's a helpful process here.

655
00:57:22.989 --> 00:57:25.150 
I don't know how that works for you at the university here.

656
00:57:25.429 --> 00:57:30.449 
At UBA, we have identified the 5-6 areas where our resource consumptions and energy consumptions are

657
00:57:30.449 --> 00:57:33.179 
in particular arise and have now developed roadmaps,

658
00:57:33.179 --> 00:57:34.139 
How we're going to get down there.

659
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:39.059 
If you don't look at it there, if you don't create the transparency, nothing happens, then you are in the routines

660
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:45.639 
of procurement, so to speak, we have to take our different responsibilities on these different

661
00:57:45.639 --> 00:57:53.820 
levels. Gentlemen with an eye on the clock, although there is still a lot to talk about, I would like to conclude this first part of our

662
00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:58.730 
Conference, problem description would like to conclude.

663
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:09.050 
Mr. Messner, Mr. Süme, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rohleder, thank you very much for your inputs and the discussion.

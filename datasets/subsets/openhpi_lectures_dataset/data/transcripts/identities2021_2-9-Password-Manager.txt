00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.390 
Now, let's have a closer look at
tools which help to deal with

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.920 
secure passwords: the
so-called Password Manager,

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.180 
in our openHPI course about
Digital Identities.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.750 
You remember secure passwords need
to be long, need to be complex,

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.080 
difficult to
remember. One

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.050 
needs a secure password, such a secure
password is needed for each account,

7
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.940 
for each identity. And if you think
about your own situation, how

8
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
many internet accounts, how many
internet services you are using,

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.400 
then most of the users have more than 20
such internet accounts and identities.

10
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.190 
So, you can't remember all
the passwords because

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.900 
taking one password for
several accounts, we

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.790 
argued already that this
should not be done.

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.310 
So, one possible solution to deal with,
and to remember such passwords is

14
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
to use technical support, technical
support that's provided by so/called

15
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.990 
Password Manager or
Password Safe.

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.910 
These password managers or password
safes are services in the

17
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.790 
internet, or programs for
your computer that manages

18
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.640 
and encrypts all the passwords
with a single strong password.

19
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.140 
To get to this tool you need one
very strong single password

20
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.170 
and then later on the system supports
you and creates complex passwords,

21
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.400 
stores this complex password -
what is for us humans difficult.

22
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.770 
So, with a password manager, with one single
password the password manager stores

23
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.830 
all our password
inputs to services

24
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.190 
and it creates

25
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.050 
passwords which are long and strong -
what is difficult for humans to do.

26
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
This service also automatically
enters the password

27
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.660 
on the right website, on the
right web service. So, when

28
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.740 
one registers with the help
of a password manager

29
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.270 
with a new service, at that moment of
registering a new digital identity

30
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.250 
is created. In this identity, the
password is an important part.

31
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.260 
The system helps to create a secure
password, the system remembers

32
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.890 
that exactly for this service
this password was valid. So,

33
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.920 
all this help is
given by the tool

34
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.450 
and they are
very valuable.

35
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.910 
Password managers exist in two
variants: in an offline variant and

36
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
in an online variant.

37
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.120 
In the last few years, such password
managers have been integrated

38
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.630 
in browsers. So,
let's start with an

39
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.170 
offline password manager, and here
I already show you one system

40
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.690 
that could be used. The idea is to use such
a system here, for example, "KeePass"

41
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.590 
or "1Password" and to
store it locally

42
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.860 
on your device in an
encrypted form.

43
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.700 
Advantages: No third-party is involved,
no third-party has access to

44
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.880 
this password manager and in this
way also not to the passwords.

45
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.150 
The disadvantage is that the data is stored
only locally on the user's device.

46
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.300 
So, if you want to use this
service, for example,

47
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.810 
you have it created and registered
with on your laptop and if you

48
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.750 
want to use the service
with your smartphone,

49
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.280 
it is not possible,
without some

50
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.670 
installations it's not possible
to access your accounts.

51
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.000 
So, synchronization is needed, so
that also with other devices

52
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.910 
that you have, you can
access the services.

53
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.810 
Another disadvantage is if
the hardware has defected,

54
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.430 
for example, if
your laptop

55
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.460 
is broken or if a
theft happens,

56
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.370 
then of course also your
password manager is gone

57
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.390 
away or is no longer working.
So, it's very important to run

58
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.240 
backups regularly, to not come
in a situation that you

59
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.230 
are no longer able to

60
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.190 
log into any of
the services.

61
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.750 
Here the "KeePass" - I recommend,
that's an open-source

62
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.830 
software that's used. So, people
have checked it, have seen it and

63
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.540 
many people trust this system. There
are also commercial solutions,

64
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.430 
"1Password" is such a commercial
solution. So, there are different

65
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.210 
possibilities and offers
for such offline

66
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.350 
password manager.

67
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.780 
Here I want to give
you an example

68
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.690 
with KeePass. So, you have to
set a master password when

69
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.340 
you create a new database
with this KeePass,

70
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.050 
and this master password that
needs to be really strong,

71
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.740 
because this is the only
password you have to remember

72
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.400 
in future, when you start to work with
such a password manager, in this case

73
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.890 
with KeePass. Here
you get a number

74
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.940 
for the evaluation of the strongest of your
master keywords (master passwords). You

75
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.650 
see with the colour code, whether you
are more in the secure area or whether

76
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.960 
you are not in the secure
area. The number of bits

77
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.790 
which result from the letters
and characters you use,

78
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.540 
can be seen when you choose
a strong password.

79
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:43.130 
Then you have this KeePass
installed, you have your password

80
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.870 
and now you want to register
with a new service.

81
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.640 
A strong password is needed
for establishing a digital

82
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.620 
identity with this new service and this is done
by the keyword manager (Password Manager),

83
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.840 
in this case by KeePass. So, you
can see here the system once the

84
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.290 
account is created and then the
password manager creates a

85
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.900 
strong password for you. You can choose
what kind of characters the password

86
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.300 
contains and then you can say
"Yes create the password".

87
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.540 
This was the registering and
then when you go back later

88
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:33.350 
to the service, you need to write the
password. Here KeePass is helping you

89
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.160 
in finding the right
password for that service

90
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.820 
in its database. So,
for example, here

91
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.450 
for an openHPI account.

92
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.130 
The idea was that this is a software
installed on your computer.

93
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.430 
Such Password Managers also
exist as online services.

94
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.570 
Here the functionality of such
a Password Manager is offered

95
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.080 
as an online service. So, the advantage
is, the passwords are synchronized

96
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:14.160 
and available for all your devices,
without taking any activity.

97
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:21.100 
And if your system, if your computer
is stolen or if something is broken,

98
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.680 
it is no problem as the data is available
in this online Password Manager.

99
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.040 
But there is also the other
side, the disadvantages.

100
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.000 
This depends on the provider,
what you know about the

101
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.540 
availability of the provider: If
the provider is not stable or if

102
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:47.330 
it's not available all the time, then
you cannot access your accounts,

103
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.130 
you cannot access and use
the services you want to.

104
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.850 
Another disadvantage is, how secure is it
to store all this very sensible data

105
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:04.940 
with such an external service, because
the service provider has access

106
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.220 
to all the data
stored in this.

107
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:15.370 
So, often commercial providers, for
example, "LastPass", "Dashlane", etc,

108
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.950 
there are a number of such providers and
here is the recommendation: you should not

109
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:27.960 
use a cost-free service because
there is a probability

110
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:34.280 
that in those services people work with the
data. Use only commercial providers you trust.

111
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:42.140 
To mention that such password
manager functionality

112
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.450 
is also available with
recent browsers,

113
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.610 
here, I can show a few:

114
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.240 
if you work with Firefox or with
the Chrome browser or Safari browser,

115
00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:01.660 
often such browser vendors offer password
managing functionality in the browser.

116
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.880 
Sometimes they even
support you in checking

117
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.810 
with a password leak database,
so to check if the password

118
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.580 
you want to use if it is already leaked
or if your password is leaked and

119
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.270 
available in such
a leak database.

120
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.170 
Typically this password manager
functionality within browsers,

121
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:32.370 
this is in the category of an
offline password manager because

122
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.820 
this data is stored in your
browser, on your device.

123
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.730 
Typically they are offline
password managers

124
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:49.260 
but with synchronization
functionality, provided for example,

125
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.560 
via "Sync" in Firefox,
with " Google Account"

126
00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.060 
in Chrome, and with
"iCloud Keyring" when

127
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.370 
you use the
Safari browser.

128
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.230 
But beware the master password
for protecting your passwords

129
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:12.210 
is activated by default, otherwise,
the browser cannot access and work.

130
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:17.010 
So this is a disadvantage
of this very convenient

131
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.120 
functionality,
password manager

132
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.750 
functionality within the browser.
So, access to passwords is easy

133
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.480 
when the browser is
accessible, but then

134
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.030 
it is available for everyone, for example,
everyone who gets access to the browser

135
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.930 
also gets access
to the data,

136
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.800 
the password data
stored there.

137
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.260 
So meanwhile all popular
browser vendors

138
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.070 
offer such password
managing

139
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:56.020 
functionalities in their browser. Here, for
example, it looks in that way: (in the browser)

140
00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.990 
"Would you like Firefox to save
this login for openHPI.de?"

141
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.730 
This is what you're shown if
you register and then you can

142
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:11.590 
save or you can say don't save,
and in this way later on

143
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.740 
if you decided to save the
password, automatically when you

144
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:22.290 
go to this page, this password
is put in the log in form,

145
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.200 
and you can easily access without
the need to remember the password.

146
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:33.480 
But the availability of the browser
gives also other people the

147
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:40.040 
access to this password data.
Here is another example, check

148
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:46.310 
with the password leak is possible, this
also comes from the Firefox browser.

149
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.710 
Here for example,
when you

150
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.430 
connect to the Facebook

151
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.020 
account then you see

152
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:03.520 
a warning - "Vulnerable Password", because
meanwhile, the browser has checked

153
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.870 
some leaked data,
like in our

154
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:14.480 
in our openHPI ID Leak checker. And
then it warns you that you should

155
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.870 
definitely change
this password.

156
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.220 
Let's summarize what we
have learned about

157
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:27.330 
the password manager: Password manager
in general offers multiple advantages.

158
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.930 
They can form complex passwords,
they can automatically generate

159
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.410 
complex passwords
that we can never

160
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.230 
remember, they can integrate
the right passwords

161
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:50.160 
in the right service that we want to
use - automatically. The password

162
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:56.010 
manager remembers which passwords
belong to which service.

163
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.390 
We need to secure the access
to the password

164
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.760 
manager. We can do this
with multiple factors.

165
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.630 
In any case, what is very
important is when we

166
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:17.270 
decide to work with such password
managers, first is that we really

167
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.790 
create and remember
a master password

168
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:26.690 
which is really secure, because this master
password which opens the password manager,

169
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.240 
gives access to all
the other passwords

170
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.930 
that are stored there.

171
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.020 
When unauthorised
people

172
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:43.150 
get access then, of course, it's very
dangerous because they can use

173
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:48.470 
all the functionality of the password
manager, they can automatically access

174
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.450 
all the services of the person
who owns the password manager.

175
00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.700 
So, definitely, you need to have
this master password and you

176
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.790 
have to secure this master password.
Then there is a question:

177
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.590 
for what kind, what
type of password

178
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.160 
manager do you decide? For an
online service or for an

179
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:18.990 
offline service? Both have their advantages,
both have their disadvantages,

180
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.790 
we discussed this
in detail.

181
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:27.680 
The recommendation, in any case,
is think about such a tool and

182
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.490 
we recommend you to
use such a tool.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.439 
Now, let's consider an example of an application in JavaScript.

2
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.139 
And let us consider it game the pong game pong

3
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.529 
game a game for two players and one ball.

4
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.269 
Here you can see is this all the two players or two players have pedals that can move

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.889 
the batter to the left and to the right, and the ball

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.999 
is moving inside this field.

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.529 
And the task is the ball cannot left to the left or to

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.689 
the right side. But the ball can left the field up a downside

9
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.279 
and the goal of the player is to

10
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.749 
avoid is to take care with their pedal sets.

11
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.829 
The ball cannot move out of the field, a

12
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.499 
touchdown or two upside for this application

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.059 
for this JavaScript application. We have a place a complete

14
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.589 
code on the download section of openHPI so

15
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.299 
you can accesses. And we have combined it with the task

16
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.249 
in this code. There are some missing, some small missing parts,

17
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.199 
and we asked you to complete this code

18
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.620 
to get a feeling and understanding of such an JavaScript application.

19
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.619 
So here is the description of of a of C

20
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.719 
a JavaScript application. The title is pong canvas

21
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.349 
and then we have to load.

22
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.029 
And the J Query Framework says that all

23
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.559 
the functionality of Jake Berry is available and then

24
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.229 
we can start to define the objects.

25
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.969 
One object is a ball of the ball, as that's described

26
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.519 
in the context. The context of the canvas of the canvas, which describes a field

27
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.589 
as this is here as a context.

28
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.549 
Then we have with this

29
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.019 
functionality. It describes the state of the object bowl, for example,

30
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.479 
the radius radios 10 and later on

31
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.080 
here that we can initialize this object.

32
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.959 
This refers as this helps us later to refer to this

33
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.089 
object, to this object bowl.

34
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.529 
Here you can see this. Now we want to add functionality to

35
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.479 
our object bowl as this is done by means of function.

36
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.929 
And we describe the initialization of the bowl,

37
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.909 
which says that the bowl is exactly in the middle of the field

38
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.059 
half of the way to half of the height.

39
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.469 
And this later on describes the movement of the bowl.

40
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.749 
And in this initialization, the bowl is still in the middle

41
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.519 
of the field and is not moving, and then

42
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.659 
the ball starts, starts to move.

43
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.089 
And this is described by means of this

44
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.779 
of the delta of C, Pyramid X and

45
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.089 
Epsilon. This is an bold in JavaScript class Smith

46
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.239 
random. A random number is a juice.

47
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.429 
And then if this random number is smaller than 0.5,

48
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.679 
then ball is moving to the left.

49
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.509 
Otherwise, ball is moving to the right and in the case of C

50
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.849 
Vertical X, the ball is moving up or down.

51
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.499 
By the way, this is a ternary operator we discussed in

52
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.389 
the clip before.

53
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.629 
Here is the object is the object petal

54
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.159 
object, and the functionality of suspended object is

55
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.809 
now described as a movement of this object,

56
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.969 
and this is controlled by events

57
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.729 
by pushing a certain key.

58
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.529 
So it is right down, chelcee up, left down key.

59
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.779 
And for example, if the right down key is pressed, then the

60
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.459 
X variable is changed in this

61
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.479 
way and otherwise the other way.

62
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.129 
So for each of the keys, the the the action is described what

63
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.139 
the pattern is doing.

64
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.789 
So is a game or can push a key and then pushing

65
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.529 
a key separator is doing some activity.

66
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.149 
This allows a condition, so it depends from what kind of action the

67
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.169 
gamer is doing is n certain activity comes out.

68
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.819 
So right down, left down, as it's described me and variables said

69
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.919 
are that to true or to false when the key

70
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.490 
is that the pedal will react upon is pressed.

71
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.519 
So to seize a, for example, for the context of,

72
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.679 
for example, of course, this object needs to be introduced same way like the

73
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.779 
he likes the ball.

74
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.309 
You can find this if you go to see a complete code.

75
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.029 
No. We can start our game.

76
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.440 
So we describe the context of the game, which

77
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.139 
describes what's player. One player one it's moving is a

78
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.439 
pedal that's already introduced a.

79
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.539 
And then we, of course, choose

80
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.069 
Jake very to make sure that all the required elements have

81
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.389 
been loaded. When is the script started?

82
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.489 
And then we create new objects,

83
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.199 
new objects, according to their definitions.

84
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.759 
As we we create context.

85
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.969 
The field we call grade the players and then we

86
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.439 
define the event handler and event handler as this is pressing a

87
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.269 
key one key down and then zero activity

88
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.619 
that is caused by pressing exactly this key down.

89
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.769 
This was described before it's performed.

90
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.709 
So this interval idea that it's built in

91
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.159 
JavaScript function to repeatedly do something and to give

92
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.679 
them more. So for each movement, the new situation

93
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.659 
has to be displayed.

94
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.159 
So this gives the interval where a new display

95
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.879 
of C a complete situation is shown.

96
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.979 
Of course, as the ball is moving fast and we need a short interval

97
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.629 
to a repeat to refresh as the situation is

98
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.119 
that shown on Z everyone.

99
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.909 
So this is our game.

100
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.649 
This is how JavaScript application is working.

101
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.149 
So download is the complete code and

102
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.729 
completed what is missing.

103
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.169 
Some lines are missing, so you should complete it and you should, and you can

104
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.939 
try out this game on your computer to

105
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.089 
complete the missing elements in the code.

106
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.649 
You need to tool to

107
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.089 
see what's going on. Of course, you need a browser and to complete submitting

108
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.359 
elements in the code, you need the text editor.

109
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.339 
You should not use.

110
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.019 
You should not use a word processor because word processors

111
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.879 
automatically do some form of formatting and other things.

112
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.739 
A work with and text editor. For example, for Windows, it's Notepad

113
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.239 
Plus Plus for Linux, it's G Edit or Nano for X

114
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.939 
is text made also apply in a do not use

115
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.019 
it because this is a word processor.

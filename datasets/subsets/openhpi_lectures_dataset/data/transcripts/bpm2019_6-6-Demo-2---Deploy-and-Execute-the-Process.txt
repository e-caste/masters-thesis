00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.510 
Hello and welcome back. So
I'm returning this time

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.570 
to discuss how to actually deal
with the model once you've

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.540 
actually deployed it and have
it running on the engine and

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.850 
the various different things that
you have to take into account

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.660 
when you have a running
process. Now lets see exactly

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.520 
where we are right now. You probably
may make it look slightly

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.790 
familiar because I am right
here as Nela left off on the

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.370 
big difference of course
being that I am now using a

9
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.880 
different operating system, windows,
slightly improved from Nela's

10
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.760 
linux and well depends on who you ask
and also I am using opera. Another

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.740 
interesting thing is that I also
have eclipse here. I also have

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.080 
the same project that Nela
talked about. And of course we

13
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.450 
share this project and you can
too. Yeah because it's on github

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.560 
so we republish the link in
the course instruction

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.880 
or under our week instruction and
please feel free to download

16
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.660 
it and maybe you like
to implement the java

17
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.200 
delegate that we have as just
locking something to a consul

18
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.060 
maybe you would like to make it
a mail server. Exactly. What

19
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.200 
you need to do then is get that
and then get the platform and

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.610 
you can play around yourself
on what we are doing.

21
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.370 
So meanwhile if you go back
here so this is cockpit this

22
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.220 
is Camunda's front end. Now interestingly
cockpit is used for administrators

23
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.390 
to be able to find out what's
going on in their process. And

24
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.130 
so they can do things like see
where the tokens are they can

25
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.580 
do things like manipulate tokens
and right now we're going

26
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.860 
to step through a few
of the features. Now

27
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.490 
actually we're not going to only
deal with cockpit because

28
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.700 
we're also going
to deal with

29
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.200 
as Nela alluded to and before there's
a second front end called task list.

30
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.900 
And here is where users and process
participants are able to actually see tasks

31
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.050 
and complete them as well as being the
start processes in this and that.

32
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.280 
And we're going to step through
the process that Nela just

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.590 
deployed which is our
our lovely openHPI

34
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.710 
process. So the first thing
I'll do is I'll go appear

35
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
to start process and I will
click on openHPI and I will

36
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.800 
you can see here that all the
data there that is showing

37
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.750 
up for this user is also what
Nela added as a front end

38
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.680 
already in the previous example. So
I'm going to add my name Niall@

39
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.590 
email.com and high chance of
theft yeah sure why not,

40
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.640 
what is the value of my car-
lets go two thousand I have

41
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.220 
I don't have a car so yeah I
definitely don't have a DUI

42
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.370 
I would require having
a car to do that so

43
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.520 
I mean I've been into
cycling accidents.

44
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.770 
Well I know I am cycling home after
this I plan to use an extra one then.

45
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.690 
So traffic violations other side
of cyclist therefore this could

46
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.520 
be the late thousands but actually
I think they specifically

47
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.370 
want to topic car one so I will leave
that to zero. Safety training

48
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.050 
I mean I wear a helmet so that's important
and driver age let's go twenty eight,

49
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.080 
and let's say that I'm in the eu and
the type of car well obviously

50
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.930 
I'm used to a certain standard so
I'm going to go with luxury.

51
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.080 
And how old is my car? Let's say
one year. So now the idea here

52
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.260 
is the process has not actually
started yet. This is a way of

53
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.790 
being able to capture the information. Now
the process begins when I click start.

54
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.080 
So when I do we're
going to end up

55
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.200 
starting an instance to the process
and actually if we take a

56
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.110 
look at our process itself, we're
going to end up starting and

57
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.570 
then we're going to run right
through this table here

58
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.160 
and depending on the result we will
then calculate the premium and then

59
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.650 
send out a cheque and then wait
here. Alternatively we could also

60
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.400 
be review necessary or not eligible.
So let's find out what I get

61
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.250 
this time. So I
click start.

62
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.300 
Ok so the process has has
gone ahead the front end

63
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.450 
has disappeared and now it's basically
in the hands of the process.

64
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.590 
If you want to know what's happening
I go back to cockpit. So

65
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.700 
in cockpit as I said it's an
overview of the process itself.

66
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.320 
If I refresh this page I should then see
though we have one instance has started.

67
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.920 
Ok so we know there is an instance
running. Now if you want

68
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180 
to know exactly what's happening we
could then click on the project itself

69
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.750 
and we can see here that, oh have
a look at that I made it all

70
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.820 
the way through to here despite
my dangerous habits. I am now

71
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.760 
I am at this point which means I
probably cleared a whole bunch

72
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.040 
of stuff, like I cleared this, I
was found eligible, I cut to

73
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.350 
the premium and so on. But you
don't have to take my word for

74
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.050 
it because as well as finding
out what the current state is

75
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.390 
it's important to be able to see the
history. So they click on history

76
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.940 
I will now actually then see specifically
what order I did everything

77
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.180 
in. Since here I ran this
table and then run over here

78
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.700 
and so on so forth. Ok so that's
pretty good. I now know that

79
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.820 
I went the direction I think I
did but obviously I might be

80
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.920 
interested in why did I skip through the
net how did someone possibly insure me.

81
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.620 
So let's find out. Ok so let's
first if I click on this we

82
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.480 
know of course and it is well what
happens in this particular task?

83
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.660 
Well the DMN table on the DRD structure
behind it are going to be executed.

84
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.350 
Exactly so the idea behind this
DMN table has been run. So

85
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.560 
if I want to find out what exactly happened
there I click on executed decision instances

86
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.400 
and then I would see a whole bunch of
stuff which is quite interesting.

87
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.530 
A whole bunch of different tables
were run. So if I click on lets say

88
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.090 
just this one here this is just the
determine eligibility DMN table.

89
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.450 
So um let's pick one of them let's
pick a select the DRD itself.

90
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.950 
There we go. And so let's look at
this a little bigger. So here

91
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.390 
we have that structure. What we
can see here is that each table

92
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.280 
is called, that little one there
indicates that I call this table

93
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.390 
then this one and all that resulted
in something. So I can see

94
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.770 
how the DRD worked. But we also
want to know what the individual

95
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.400 
stuff that happened was. So let's pick an
individual task. Let's say for instance

96
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.050 
I want to see how did my
driver category get decided?

97
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.890 
I click on here and I can see
the table itself. We had input

98
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.790 
of driver safety training true
because they wear a helmet and

99
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.170 
the age twenty eight. So there
I am a typical driver that

100
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.140 
is good to know. So let's head back and
check some other stuff. So let's say

101
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.220 
how did I end up with my eligibility
score? It is a little further up.

102
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.010 
But everything below must have
been run for that to happen.

103
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.550 
So I can click in here and I can
then see the inputs were that

104
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.010 
I was given the value provisional and
insurable. Well that's good news.

105
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.930 
And if I was given that it means the
score was a collect policy which

106
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.400 
we have discussed already which
given fifty. So and fifty plus

107
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.940 
zero so which is fifty. Very good.
Our math skills are on point.

108
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.340 
So that's what we
can see. So we can

109
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.220 
in runtime cockpit gives the
ability to find a specific

110
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.440 
instance and not just know
where it is but how

111
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.200 
it got there and why it got there
which is really important.

112
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.910 
But of course that's just one
factor when it comes to

113
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.880 
dealing with the process in
production. Another interesting

114
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.100 
thing would be if we happened to
change something in our process.

115
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.370 
And we had stuff running. So the
first thing I could do is I

116
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.330 
could say well actually let's imagine I made
a mistake in the form. Ok. Could happen.

117
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.330 
So yeah exactly, I mean obviously I don't
drive so a mistake by even applying

118
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.700 
but something even more interesting
would be let's imagine

119
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.700 
that I, um, here are the variables
that I can see that I added.

120
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.480 
So I can actually change these variables
in run-time so I can maybe say

121
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.730 
let's say I am what's a good thing
to change? Shall we go with

122
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.720 
maybe you you have been- maybe I have
a DUI for some reason. So I say

123
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.020 
ok tick that box. Maybe I change
it because I don't like you

124
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.420 
and then you have a problem applying
for the insurance. Oh that's

125
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.980 
not very nice. I don't know. If Nela
was an admin she would try to

126
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.610 
do anything so you don't get it. I
know it's not true but you know.

127
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.220 
So what we can do then is and then
it can be changed accidents

128
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.130 
up to like let's say nine and why
not and now this has changed

129
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.880 
the variables, ok of this instance
which is fine but if you

130
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.940 
were actually in production you would
want to re-run the tables again.

131
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.690 
And that's where the fun happens,
because then I can say let's modify

132
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.030 
this process. If I click the modify
and by that i'm going to actually

133
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.130 
take this token. Ok and
I'm going to move it to

134
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.660 
back over here to check availability.
So let's just grab this token here

135
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.860 
and move it over here.

136
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.770 
Ok so if we take a look at what
this is going to do it's going

137
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.510 
to cancel the token which is on
the current thing and then

138
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.720 
it's going to move it to this back
to this task again. So if I apply

139
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.250 
it will re-run those calculations
in DMN tables and let's

140
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.390 
see what happened now.

141
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.320 
See the history. Oh my, look at
this. I have to now it's changed.

142
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.110 
I now got to review the case in
some way. So this has gone very

143
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.030 
badly for me obviously. If I
take a look at the history

144
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.620 
you'll see that we got to this
point and this indicates that

145
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.800 
we got here but we actually
didn't complete this. Instead

146
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.920 
you can see that we ran this twice
and then the second time we ran it

147
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.270 
it arrived here. There's lots of
stuff that's also stored in

148
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.050 
history that I don't want to go
through too much detail. For

149
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.740 
instance I did change the deal I
think, so therefore we do actually

150
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.510 
have a record that it was originally set
at one point than changed another.

151
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.420 
This is really important for
audit reasons because you have

152
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.660 
a process and you're really interested
in what happened at each stage,

153
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.720 
an executable process engine basically
stores the audit of all of that.

154
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.510 
Ok so that's where we are right now. Now
another thing that happens quite frequently

155
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.370 
in these kind of processes is that
we actually change the process

156
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.670 
itself. So let's head back here
for a moment. One of the things

157
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.080 
I can do is I can say well you know
what after we review the case

158
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.140 
a very important thing, any good ideas
of what we would do afterwards?

159
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.340 
Drink coffee. That's a good idea.
I mean realistically we should

160
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.620 
be drinking coffee consistently. So
let's let's have a drink coffee here.

161
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.910 
Ok good stuff. So there's a
little task that we have and we

162
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:20.380 
just added this to our existing file.
So now we would like to get this

163
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.940 
up into the into the deployment where
we can actually use it. So let's

164
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.990 
go back to eclipse for a moment.
I'm going to do exactly what

165
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.510 
Nela did before which is I
am going to build this

166
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.680 
using maven install.

167
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.200 
And this once more is going to run
through the tests, it is going to

168
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.670 
create the war file and once I
do that and then going to

169
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.170 
take that war file and deploy
it. And what's happening

170
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.160 
in the interesting thing to remember
is that when I deploy it we

171
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.550 
actually have a running instance.
You can see right here that

172
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.060 
this thing is running. So what
will happen when I deploy it?

173
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.340 
So first of all there we go. I'm just
going to override the existing one.

174
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.020 
Great stuff. Ok so now it's going
to redeploy this new version

175
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.500 
and what will happen Nela
if I refresh this?

176
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.590 
You would umm you will end up at
the actual or at the current

177
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.990 
version at version two, but your
instance will stay at version

178
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.350 
one for that moment. Exactly basically
nothing will change to the current view

179
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.710 
because we don't want a new deployment
to affect the stuff is running.

180
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.000 
What has changed presumably
is this little drop down

181
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.620 
on the left here or this is left,
yes it is. Now has number two.

182
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.180 
So right now our first instances
here and our second one version

183
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.630 
two is here and you see
that's got the new new

184
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.990 
very very important task which really
helps productivity of course.

185
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.940 
And if I were to start a new
instance let's go Nele.

186
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.690 
Yeah no car, I don't have one. But
I can assure one for sure sure.

187
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.260 
So let's say a low chance of theft,
car value let's go two thousand

188
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.510 
again. I have airbags for sure,
my car will have some. Just

189
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.400 
no DUIs? No. Any accidents? Not
that I'm aware of, maybe.

190
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.080 
Other people are. Ok ok. We'll give
you a pretty clean bill of health.

191
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.760 
Yeah let's go you're also twenty
eight let's say. Yeah. And let's

192
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.360 
I'm from the rest of the world.
Are you? That's a great country.

193
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.660 
Yeah. Would you like a compact
sedan or luxury car?

194
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.110 
I also go for looks, right?
Yeah of course. Well why not?

195
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.160 
How old do you want your car to be?
Well I don't know, three years.

196
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.240 
Ok maybe three. Let's see what
happens. Okay great. So

197
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.120 
I don't know where I end up so
who knows. Well now let's see.

198
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.680 
So if I refresh this let's
take a look at our

199
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.920 
history here. So in the new instance
will always start the newest

200
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.530 
version and fantastically
enough Nele got through

201
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.600 
the calculated premium and would
have gotten her things sent along.

202
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:58.020 
Now interestingly if let's say
we did go to the review case

203
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.870 
which is not that I
trust you Nela, but

204
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.410 
I just want to make sure that
our insurance company isn't

205
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.420 
just insuring people they shouldn't.
So I'm just going to maybe

206
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.560 
go to the run time and I'm
going to just move this token

207
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.800 
over here, just to just to
make sure. That's so nice of

208
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.070 
you. No, no problem. I was so happy
to get this insurance ready.

209
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.650 
I'm sorry but that's just the way it is,
just to make sure of these things.

210
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.040 
So there we go. So I moved the token
then here. So now we're there.

211
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.700 
Now which is great because now we
have in our task list we have two

212
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:36.870 
case review tasks. One is here,
okay and after I reviewed Nele's

213
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:41.000 
case, the reviewer will then take a look
at all the details it's all read-only.

214
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.200 
And then we will also be able
to oh no look if they review

215
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.160 
my case they don't get a coffee which is
very very sad. That's very sad yeah.

216
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.510 
So this is it is an important thing
is everyone quite likes coffee.

217
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.180 
So what we can do is we can actually
then this little button down here

218
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.140 
and we can click on this and this
will actually let us migrate

219
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.580 
the instances that are running in the
previous version to the new version

220
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.720 
meaning coffee for all. So I click
that button, we have the two

221
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.960 
processes side by side, you see
the differences here. And we

222
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.120 
have a migration plan which
shows this will move to here.

223
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.350 
And yeah and then yeah let's do
it. Yes or then I can click

224
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.880 
select instances so that I can pick
the specific ones I want to migrate.

225
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.820 
I mean everyone likes coffee. Yeah
exactly. So let's just do everything

226
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.200 
and then I can click execute and now an
interesting thing has happened which is

227
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.790 
we now have two instances and they are
now both here in the same version.

228
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.980 
If we look at the perspective
from the front end here if I

229
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.860 
just click on this you can see
the user now is on that point

230
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.010 
where they can actually complete
this and get coffee afterwards

231
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.030 
and are basically unaffected by it.
So this is a really important

232
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.370 
feature, it allows us to make
sure that in run-time we have

233
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.940 
what Nele described initially
as this nice business IT

234
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.820 
alignment where just because a
process is deployed we no longer

235
00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.930 
need to say oh we've forgotten
about it. Instead we can make

236
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.840 
improvements and redeploy in run-time
without affecting too much.

237
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.710 
It's a very important part
of using an engine because

238
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.200 
a business IT alignment and
improvement is only really as

239
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.140 
good as the cycle of
improvement allows us to be.

240
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.130 
So eventually we could then actually
complete some of these tasks. So let's

241
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.660 
select this. So this is of course
a task list as I mentioned

242
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.510 
and this is a place where you
see me start a process but I

243
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.950 
can also do things like find
tasks. Now right now this task

244
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.340 
here is assigned to nobody. It
could have a follow up date, so

245
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.410 
I can add a date to this to say
ok follow up maybe next week.

246
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.420 
Maybe I can give it a due date where I
can say ok it is June twenty sixth.

247
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.730 
Now this can be set programmatically
but it's a nice idea to

248
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.570 
be able to set this. And then I can
also this very important claim it

249
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.070 
because what we can do is we can
add these tasks and then lots

250
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.390 
of people can see them and if someone
wants to do it then click claim.

251
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.480 
And now it becomes demo
task. And now we see

252
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:05.690 
my tasks list here. I click on
that. There are my tasks. I have

253
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.540 
these two guys here but I also have
review case which is really important.

254
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.830 
So then I can actually do this
task if I want to. And you can

255
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.140 
see here that I can decide whether
I approve it or not. Um this

256
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.110 
is Nele, let's just take a look at
your details. If I don't approve

257
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.700 
what should happen is we should go
to prepare letter of rejection.

258
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.790 
So first you go to drink coffee
anyhow. That's true. So I'm yeah

259
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.170 
so either way, so let me
have a look at this.

260
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.480 
Also looking good Nele. Not not sure,
I don't think so. Oh it failed.

261
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.170 
So let's see, oh
also failed.

262
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.730 
So alright yes this may be a
problem with the front end.

263
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:46.860 
So luckily Nele gets her
gets her her insurance

264
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.870 
because I simply cannot
complete this task properly.

265
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.040 
Now another important thing here
are the filters. The filters are

266
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.510 
the things that allow us to see
our tasks. So for instance if

267
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.910 
I am working just my tasks that's quite
easy but if I wanted to work on

268
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.890 
specific tasks for for
instance openHPI

269
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.670 
then I would only want tasks from
that process. So I can say

270
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.650 
on criteria I want to
see all of the tasks

271
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.670 
where the process key is openHPI
and now I have a specific

272
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.960 
filter that will show all of
those tasks that are available.

273
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.970 
So there are lots of different
ways of displaying that.

274
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.210 
Yep so right now we have
our two tasks here in

275
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.790 
in there and we can also of course
have redeployed we can then

276
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.160 
make these changes and also
directly manipulate the process.

277
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.340 
There's a whole bunch of other
stuff as well that's associated

278
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.910 
with this including error handling
and a few other bits and

279
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.530 
pieces that I probably need to show you
for now but what I would advise is

280
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.340 
that if you want to explore
this in more deep way,

281
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.750 
first of all feel free to download the
open source version of the process

282
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.600 
of the engine which doesn't
have all the features you

283
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.880 
saw here but has a majority of it has
a has all the stuff you'll need.

284
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.990 
And also download the project
that we just showed. Maybe it

285
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.420 
might even be working by
the time you find it.

286
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.050 
Ok so thanks again, we'll make it work.
Thank you very much and yeah I hope

287
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:08.820 
you enjoy the course.

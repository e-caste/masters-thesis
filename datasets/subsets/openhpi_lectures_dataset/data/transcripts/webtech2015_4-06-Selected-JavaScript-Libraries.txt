1
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.130 
Now, let's consider some selected JavaScript libraries.

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.039 
We have already discussed about frameworks and now inside the frameworks

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.719 
we need, functionality and functionalities are provided by

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.550 
JavaScript libraries.

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.519 
Such an JavaScript library is a pre-written collection of functionality,

6
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.319 
which provides and performs very specific, well defined operations.

7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.359 
And if you have the task to design an application, there are many of such well-defined

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.979 
operations and then you can take out of the library as the

9
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.779 
functionality not necessary to design it, to design

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.970 
it by the web design or something else.

11
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.899 
They help such libraries help to make the development of a JavaScript based web

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.499 
application faster and more easier.

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.269 
Some famous and popular JavaScript libraries are

14
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.769 
Jake Mary JK Rowling UI, the HTML Lex Dojo

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.239 
Toolkit, Rafaela three dots the three

16
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.829 
dots. Yes, we cannot look to all of these, but we consider

17
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.389 
a few to give you a feeling about this,

18
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.139 
the work and the so nature of such libraries.

19
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.179 
But I should mention we this week we speak about the

20
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.399 
client side application, so we speak about frameworks and libraries

21
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.019 
that mainly used for designing applications on the client

22
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.969 
side. Next week, when we speak about the oversight applications, then

23
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.739 
we will discuss some other libraries and frameworks.

24
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.389 
Let's start with an example with the example of J.

25
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.829 
Query Jake Barry, perhaps, is the most popular JavaScript

26
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.199 
library. It's used by more than 60 percent of the

27
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.239 
10000 most visited websites, so 6000

28
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.069 
of them are designed with by means of the jQuery

29
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.829 
library query libraries, a free and open source software.

30
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.469 
It provides multiple browser support.

31
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.449 
It provides navigation on the dome object model.

32
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.039 
It allows manipulation by means of the dome object model, as

33
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.139 
there is an extended event. System included helper functions

34
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.689 
such, for example, as Inari, and each Ajax functionality

35
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.489 
is available extended and this is

36
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.939 
extendable through various plugins.

37
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.270 
Let's shortly consider how jQuery is used, and

38
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.249 
it's really very simple to integrate it.

39
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.809 
So jQuery Library is one JavaScript

40
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.819 
file that contains all functions.

41
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.629 
This file can be included within a web page,

42
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.199 
so they are different possibilities, as can be included by linking to a local copy

43
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.729 
of this file. This is done in this way, but it can

44
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.529 
also be linked to a copy copy that's available

45
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.289 
on a public server. In that case, it looks like this

46
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.859 
is the RSA as the address given

47
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.839 
where the copy of this fire can be accessed.

48
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.709 
In that case, a file will be downloaded to the client and hence its

49
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.539 
minified. So all the brackets are removed, white spaces

50
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.269 
are removed and that so that this file only

51
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.859 
has the size of 32 kilobytes and

52
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.819 
can easily and fast be downloaded.

53
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.329 
So here you have SIG. You can, you can look at it.

54
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.809 
This is Jake.

55
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.949 
Jake, we file.

56
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.739 
Let's consider some of the functionality.

57
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.610 
So we have the dollar function selector.

58
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.399 
It selects the button element with the class over you

59
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.899 
and change its HTML to see the

60
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.879 
topic over you. So this is the this is what is done by this example,

61
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.479 
which is shown here. This example for dollar function or

62
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.100 
as each function here is each function is

63
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.029 
doing that. Something is done with each element of

64
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.839 
every year that is used, all the gaining

65
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.119 
functionality. Jake, rary comments can be changed,

66
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.229 
and this is done in that in that way.

67
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.659 
You can see with this example.

68
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.159 
So this is only to give you a short introduction and short feeling about

69
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.959 
Jake. Very. Let's consider another important example

70
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.459 
Rafa. Rafael. This is the web page of a true web page of

71
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.899 
this JavaScript library that is this small

72
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.559 
rivalry, and it is designed particularly for work with

73
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.560 
Subjectto graphics.

74
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.089 
So every a big object is also a

75
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.029 
dome object and can be modified.

76
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.239 
So if Rafael Dodge's has to be downloaded,

77
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.889 
it is larger than Jack Marriott's one kilobyte and

78
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.049 
has to be included in the HTML page.

79
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.589 
This Rafael is easy to learn, and it's a good choice

80
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.689 
for throwing not to complex things like, for example, charts

81
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.549 
or simple figures Rafa.

82
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.909 
It can be extended by means of plug ins.

83
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.589 
It is a free and open source software with the MIT

84
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.049 
license model, and to give a simple example

85
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.079 
for the how Rafael is used.

86
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.939 
Let's look to a canvas and a circle

87
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.389 
on it, and let's see how it's designed.

88
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.439 
We have here to create the as a canvas.

89
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.449 
The size is given. This is the place is given and then we can,

90
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.129 
by means of RFA, define the object

91
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.749 
in this case, a circle which is placed on the on

92
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.639 
the canvas in a very simple way, though as a user can

93
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.159 
use, this functionality can use this from the libraries.

94
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.539 
This functions to create certain effects without

95
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.920 
the necessity to design this by hand.

96
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.719 
So this is a result if you apply this example that you see that they

97
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.599 
can Wessexes Radd Seiger placed on this, and you can compare

98
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.529 
it to this example, as that's exactly what we can see

99
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.399 
more. More complex examples and a good documentation

100
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.239 
you can find of the project website.

101
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.899 
So this is only to give you a feeling for what

102
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.139 
for what tasks such JavaScript libraries can be used

103
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.699 
so they can be used and should be used in JavaScript

104
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.259 
frameworks we discussed, we have already discussed in

105
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.390 
another in another video clip.

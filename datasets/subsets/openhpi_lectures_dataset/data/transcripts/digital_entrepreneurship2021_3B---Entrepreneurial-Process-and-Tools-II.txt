00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.372 
Welcome. Welcome to the second part of the entrepreneurial

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.529 
process and the instruments and methods we need

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.929 
in that entrepreneurial process.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.370 
As you might remember from our first session, the entrepreneurial process

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.489 
is not straight, it's not linear, it's rather iterative,

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.809 
it is broad and narrow and it's diverging

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.505 
back and forth. And in today's session, I want to focus

8
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.149 
on the first two parts on the fourth side.

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.549 
So on detecting opportunities, on realizing

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.470 
that there is change. And the second part, the design thinking part,

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.218 
where we create new solutions to

12
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.810 
the problems or the opportunities that we have detected.

13
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.480 
And then in that third session, it will all be about actually creating

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.260 
solutions. But first, let's start with the foresight.

15
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.329 
Now, foresight helps you to maybe not

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.949 
predict the future, but to understand the future a little

17
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.596 
better. And as you might have realized by now, digital

18
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.802 
entrepreneurship is all about exponential change

19
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.569 
and growth. And that happens quite fast, quite quickly.

20
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.849 
And it is our job as entrepreneurs, as people in

21
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.496 
organizations, as citizens to prepare ourselves better

22
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.849 
for that change and to understand where the future might lead us

23
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.019 
to. So it's about perceiving change.

24
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.799 
It's about prospective change, and it's about probing change.

25
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.620 
Is that really the future we want to have?

26
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.329 
So let's start with a perceiving. How can we perceive change?

27
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.494 
We can detect trends and we do this by trend management.

28
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.870 
And I'll cover some of the instruments and methods you can use for that in just a second.

29
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.849 
The whole trends and opportunities will then be identified

30
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.084 
and evaluated in, for example, an opportunity radar where you have

31
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.930 
all of these opportunities lined up.

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.819 
Put them into a portfolio where you evaluate for yourself, are

33
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.350 
they worthwhile pursuing?

34
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.240 
Do I have the resources to pursue them?

35
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.852 
Will they actually be a good future prospective for me and

36
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.540 
my business?

37
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.069 
It's then also about thinking and building scenarios.

38
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.719 
And exactly the question I just ask you, is that something for me

39
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.631 
I want to pursue? And is it actually my

40
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.129 
picture of the future I want to have?

41
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.985 
This is what we call scenarios and a scenario based strategizing and also a

42
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.639 
scenario based business modeling helps you to

43
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.660 
have different scenarios at your fingertips

44
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.469 
and then see how the future actually develops.

45
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.780 
And then take one of those scenarios.

46
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.259 
Let's take the pandemic. Let's take covid-19,12

47
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.529 
months ago in March 2020 we thought that,

48
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.911 
oh, it might take us a year and then it will all be over and our life

49
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.450 
will be just as they were before.

50
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.060 
Now, in retrospect, that was a best case scenario, which unfortunately

51
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.960 
didn't happen. It rather happened a worst case scenario that

52
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.569 
covid-19 is still there.

53
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.461 
It actually mutated. And we have to develop our businesses,

54
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.459 
our societies and our organizations accordingly.

55
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.416 
There's a scenario based thinking, and it also shows you that now assuming

56
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.059 
that the next one, two, five years from now might

57
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.499 
have different scenarios, you have to think

58
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.750 
and you have to acquire differently depending on those resources.

59
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.009 
Now, the implementation then is already part of that last

60
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.569 
part of the entrepreneur process to thinking of how do I match

61
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.279 
resources, how do I match my products and services to these things

62
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.360 
I learned from my foresight process and then build

63
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.199 
my organization or my business accordingly.

64
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.569 
So let's look at those different instruments you can use for this foresight.

65
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.579 
And it's very important to understand that all of these tools

66
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.949 
actually tackle different levels.

67
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.829 
And you might have heard about the iceberg model.

68
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.999 
The iceberg model tells you that only a small little piece of

69
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.720 
that iceberg is actually visible to our eyes.

70
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.850 
So this one is floating above the water, but there's a lot more

71
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.454 
below the water. And in order to understand what is floating above the water, you have

72
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.189 
to understand what is below.

73
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.229 
Now, the events. This is your iceberg.

74
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.543 
This is what you. See, but these events are triggered by behavioral

75
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.970 
patterns, how we as humans behave.

76
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.730 
It's about the changes we see and

77
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.529 
it's about how these things actually correlate

78
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.519 
with other things and how the developments are linked and how

79
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.759 
the patterns are influenced.

80
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.661 
And on the very basis of the iceberg, our mental models, we as humans

81
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.549 
have, which values, which beliefs and assumptions do we have about

82
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.666 
the future? And you can see on the right side on the slides, these are all different

83
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.129 
methods and instruments you can use to actually detect those different levels of the

84
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.450 
iceberg. And it would be too long to cover all of them.

85
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.949 
So there will be some additional readings available if you're interested, and

86
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.940 
there might even be coming moves in the future, specifically

87
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.013 
fostering strategic foresight.

88
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.399 
But let's see, so on that mental model level, you can use

89
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.989 
ethnographic studies and test to understand better how people think

90
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.429 
and behave. You can then use a systems dynamics model to actually put

91
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.609 
that into perspective because we all know it's only us.

92
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.510 
But if we are more and if we link ourselves to the

93
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.832 
grand picture, it helps us to understand better how the future might

94
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.079 
evolve. Scenario analysis, I already covered to

95
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.508 
assume that there are different scenarios in the future and to

96
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.649 
make them as explicit, as visible as possible

97
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.296 
so that we can understand how that might influence our

98
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.680 
thinking and acting right now.

99
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.360 
Wildcard portfolios, now covid-19 appears to be quite a wild

100
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.750 
card. No one had predicted that, although that's not quite correct.

101
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.141 
There were actually some scenarios that had such a worldwide pandemic

102
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.509 
they predicted.

103
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.029 
They were only small and not many people knew about them, so still

104
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
covid-19 was a wild card.

105
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.087 
9/11 was a wild card and you as an entrepreneur being

106
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.899 
in the digital world, you need to know that there will be wild cards happening

107
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.829 
and you have to prepare for that.

108
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.106 
The trends are already covered. So conducting trend audits, having a trend

109
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.806 
or technology radar available where you see how trends

110
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.150 
are linked, how they might develop in one year and three in five years

111
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.561 
from now, that all helps you to better understand

112
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.009 
and be prepared for the future, because this is a fundamental

113
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.749 
school you need to have as a digital entrepreneur.

114
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.040 
Now, I already covered a little bit of the human aspect

115
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.269 
and the human aspect is actually of profound

116
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:20.170 
importance if we think about how innovation happens.

117
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.980 
So we always have those three different parts of

118
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.529 
technology. And this is really important.

119
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.059 
If we talk about digital entrepreneurship, obviously we're covering digital technologies.

120
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.430 
We need to think what is feasible, what technologies can we

121
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.009 
develop? Can we invent?

122
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.119 
But at the same time, for us as entrepreneurs having an entrepreneur mindset, it's

123
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.570 
important to ask the question, is it actually viable?

124
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.980 
Will we make money with it?

125
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.855 
And both of these perspectives are nothing if we don't understand

126
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.049 
what the people, what the human needs.

127
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.359 
So what is desirable?

128
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.559 
What is usable in the eyes of the beholder?

129
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.330 
And in order to understand these human values, in order to incorporate

130
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.684 
that human perspective, that need-driven development of everything

131
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.240 
you do as an entrepreneur, we use design thinking.

132
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.469 
And again, design thinking is an art for itself.

133
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.179 
And there is fortunately enough already a very nice move out

134
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.619 
there on design thinking. There are classes here at the Hustle Plattner Institute

135
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.900 
at the HPI  or at the School of Design thinking.

136
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.010 
So let me just be really brief here.

137
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.556 
This is the typical design thinking process.

138
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.419 
And what you see here is we start with understanding the problem.

139
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.809 
It's about asking the right questions.

140
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.500 
It's about observing how people behave because it is very different

141
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.919 
from what people say and what they do.

142
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.769 
And it's, again, different what they feel.

143
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.299 
So understanding that it is more than just

144
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.399 
what the eye sees and what people say, that is one of the first fundamentals

145
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.929 
of design thinking. You then come to defining your point of

146
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.309 
view, your individual perspective of what actually the problem is.

147
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.330 
And then you start ideating, then you start developing your solutions.

148
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.100 
And then actually the third part of our entrepreneurial process starts.

149
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.950 
It's about prototyping and testing.

150
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.119 
And I will cover that last part in our last session.

151
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.100 
Thank you for today and see you next time.

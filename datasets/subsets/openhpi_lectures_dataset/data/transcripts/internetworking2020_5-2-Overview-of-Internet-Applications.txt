1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970 
In our OpenHPI course, a
half-century of internet

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.460 
we want to give now an overview about
the various internet applications.

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.460 
What are internet applications,
typically we call an application

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.490 
an internet application
when we can use

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.550 
application service by means of our computer
that is connected to the internet.

6
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.760 
So for example, what can be
done in the world wide web

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.050 
as this is an internet application
an email communication,

8
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.450 
the instant message or check
systems file transfer that is

9
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.220 
possible over the internet. Then
the various cloud services

10
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.190 
are unimaginable without the
internet and streaming,

11
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.780 
to mention here only a few of the
important applications, voice over

12
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.140 
IP is another one, various security
questions in the different applications,

13
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.280 
the online gaming, online
shopping, the internet of things

14
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.330 
with small devices that can interact with
each other by means of internet technology.

15
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.070 
All these are providing
internet applications

16
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.690 


17
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
via the world wide web.

18
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.140 
So, for example,
online shopping,

19
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.180 
Amazon, Thalia, Otto, eBay, Lieferando
to mention only a few of its services.

20
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.790 
Search engines,
Google, Bing, Yahoo,

21
00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.830 
Ecosia, DuckDuckGo. Social
networks, Facebook, LinkedIn,

22
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.010 
StayFriends. Another group
of internet applications

23
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.920 
that are accessible via the world wide web
are blogs, articles, and communities,

24
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.470 
to mention Chefkoch,
Motor-Talk, GoFeminin.

25
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.450 
News portals, n-tv, Stern,
Tagesschau, Speigel.

26
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.660 
Travel, Expedia, TUI,
FTI, Urlaubspiraten.

27
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.200 
Price comparison platforms, Check24,
Booking.com, Holidaycheck.

28
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.860 
or offers for digital
learning like our OpenHPI.

29
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.650 
Email with a various different
systems Gmail, web.de, Outlook.com

30
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
GMX. Instant messaging and chat
WhatsApp is very famous,

31
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.270 
Telegram or RocketChat.
Entertainment

32
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.930 
becomes more and more important and although
a little bit problematic because of the

33
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.020 
huge amount of energy that is
needed for streaming Netflix

34
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.510 
online browser games.
Navigation systems

35
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.760 
and services like google maps,
TomTom, Lomoot, Tourenfahrer.

36
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.640 
Online banking from various banks
provided, I think meanwhile

37
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.130 
almost all banks provide
these are famous groups of

38
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.550 
internet applications.

39
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.190 
And now the question is, how
these applications can be used

40
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.710 
on the internet?

41
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.840 
What is needed are communication
protocols and these are the

42
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.060 
application protocols in the
so-called application layer of

43
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.000 
the TCP IP protocol stack,
which enables the application

44
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.340 
which does not belong
to the stack

45
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.090 
to make use of the internet to interact with
the users to interact with other services.

46
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.360 
So is the application itself the world wide
web, the online shopping, online banking

47
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.690 
does not belong to the application layer,
but for each of this application

48
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.310 
in the protocol on the application,
the layer is necessary that this

49
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.560 
application can make use of the
internet whether it's HTTP, whether

50
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.340 
it's a worldwideweb, map
service, which can use

51
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.680 
internet by means of
the HTTP protocol.

52
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.930 
So the application layer specifies what's
possible communication over the internet,

53
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.090 
exactly to certain
applications.

54
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.070 
So remember these are different
network technologies,

55
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.950 
are used internet layer provides this
internet data package service,

56
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.310 
then we have the transport layer
which guarantees such a a data

57
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.830 
grams not only reach other
computer, but that

58
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.430 
they also reach a certain
application and now for the

59
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.250 
application layer now this is a
transport service that provides

60
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.790 
the protocols in the
lower layers are used

61
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.960 
to interconnect with
the application.

62
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.550 
So the TCP/IP protocol stack,
protocols of the application layer

63
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.100 
they, of course, use area in
the application layer they

64
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.680 
have to use the protocols of the transport
layer, for getting transported

65
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.730 
inside the data packet service of the
IP protocol in the internet layer,

66
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.680 
to the other. So the application
protocols make use of the protocols

67
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.650 
of the transport layer
typically it's TCP or UDP.

68
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.830 
Some of them use both protocols
and TCP and UDP use IP datagram,

69
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.060 
though we spoke about
that already last week,

70
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
so here are the protocols that
make use of TCP protocol.

71
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.970 
Remember TCP protocol is a protocol
in the transmission control layer,

72
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.160 
which provides a connection-oriented
service, which is reliable

73
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.170 
and various application
protocols of TCP layer

74
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.890 
make use of TCP, for example, DNS
the domain name service which

75
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.750 
converts the domains into IP
addresses, we spoke about that

76
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.350 
or SMTP, simple mail transfer
protocol is a protocol

77
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.700 
which is used to transport emails through
the internet and to receive emails,

78
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.050 
or another example of a protocol
of the application layer that

79
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.690 
make use of TCP is HTTP the
hypertext transfer protocol,

80
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:25.750 
which enables the transport of website
data and of course there are more

81
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:32.610 
protocols on the application layer
that make use of TCP but also

82
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.020 
application layer protocols
they make use of the UDP.

83
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.220 
The other, a much more simpler
protocol on the transport layer

84
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.810 
which is connection-less
and unreliable,

85
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.700 
the following protocols of
the application layer

86
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:59.620 
make use of UDP. So the
domain name service makes

87
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:06.160 
the values of TCP as values of UDP,
it depends on what kind of messages

88
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.260 
they need to be
transported.

89
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.920 
The SNMP protocols, a simple
network management protocol which

90
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.870 
is necessary and needed for
configuration and control of network

91
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.770 
communication makes use of the
simple you UDP protocol. Or DHCP

92
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:32.050 
dynamic host configuration protocol, which
provides an assignment of IP addresses

93
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:38.750 
to individual devices in the
network, they make use of UDP.

94
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:45.170 
As well as NFS network file
system which provides access

95
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.660 
to remote data storage on
other computer systems.

96
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.090 
This is only a small selection
but it should show you that

97
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:58.740 
there are some public protocols in the
application layer that go with a very

98
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.950 
a secure and guaranteed
connection-oriented TCP protocol

99
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.410 
and there are other protocols
that go with a much a simpler

100
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.070 
connectionless
UDP protocol.

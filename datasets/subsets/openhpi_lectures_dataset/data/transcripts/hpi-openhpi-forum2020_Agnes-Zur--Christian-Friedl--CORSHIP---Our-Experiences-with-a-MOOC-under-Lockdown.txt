00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.970 
hello everybody, my name is
Stefanie from openHPI.

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.480 
I am very glad to welcome my two guests
Agnes from university of Cracow

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.700 
and Christian from FH
JOANNEUM. hello

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.990 
hello though as you all know the
topic of this year's openHPI forum

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.120 
is digital education
in times of crisis.

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.890 
I know that you both giving a
course on coinnovation on the

7
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.270 
mooc platform
moochouse this year

8
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.600 
together with a european consortium.
and the oddness maybe you

9
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.070 
could share with the community
what the course was all about

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.830 
and describe which target group you
wanted to attract with this topic.

11
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.080 
yes absolutely. so we got
together to create a course on

12
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.820 
the kona vacation recalled the
kona vacation journey. and it

13
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.670 
was dedicated to basically
everyone interested or directly

14
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.020 
involved in open innovation and coinnovation
projects between start-ups and corporations.

15
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.090 
it's a fairly
new topic.

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.940 
so it's been around for about a
decade and so it was important

17
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.930 
for us to connect people with
different perspectives and the

18
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.420 
design of the mooc was a mix
between an accident and

19
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.540 
a smoke with insides or from academics
and amazing business experts

20
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.740 
including those who are really neck
deep in co-innovation project

21
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.360 
and collaborative innovation consultancy, all
types of different contributions came together.

22
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.040 
and I think this polyphony in
our desired field enabled us

23
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.410 
to capture different perspectives
of the topic and create

24
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.620 
a mooc which was able to target
a wide audience, people

25
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.720 
from different world. so not
only people from the corporate

26
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.750 
world and from the startup world,
but also students people in

27
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.520 
between jobs and people from different
sectors who are interested in cross-sector

28
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.730 
collaboration. it was a deep
dive it wasn't a topic that

29
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.310 
we wanted to only scratch the
surface, but we really wanted

30
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.610 
to provide deep insights into
the innovations and relevant

31
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.840 
learnings for all our
participants groups.

32
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.810 
we recovered basically
three teams to sum up.

33
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.350 
the first goal was to raise
awareness about the urgency and

34
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.830 
innovation that we live in a
world and in an economy. a

35
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.160 
innovation is the new normal and
innovation is the way also

36
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.460 
who filled the grand challenges
that are here in now.

37
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.480 
we wanted to highlight and make
our participants understand

38
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.900 
that innovation can be better when
it's done together. so the benefits

39
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.860 
have cross-sectoral innovation
project. and finally we wanted

40
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.250 
our people to really grass the
differences between the two

41
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.580 
types of actors involved, so the
start-ups and the cooperates.

42
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.050 
how to bring them together in a
productive collaboration. so

43
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.260 
we actually developed and delivered
an applicable framework

44
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.630 
to use in real life projects. and within
different formats of the collaboration.

45
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.730 
so this is the mooc
enough show.

46
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.200 
thank you so much it sounds
really interesting and I think

47
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.850 
you're still able to enroll to it and to
watch it in an archived version right?

48
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.280 
yeah, it's the first iteration
was a moderated version and it

49
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.650 
connected over two thousand
participants from all over the

50
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.690 
world and now the it still on the
platform in a self-paced version.

51
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.510 
ok so yeah the covir-19 crisis changed
our daily lives tremendously.

52
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.370 
Chris, i know at the moment you
are writing your thesis on

53
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.640 
moocs and for this reason your
own observing is the sector

54
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.890 
very closely. can you give us an
overview how the crisis affected

55
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.350 
our online learning and especially
moocs and can you see in the

56
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.690 
effact also in the
cooperation work?

57
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.740 
yes that was really
interesting to observe

58
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.230 
first for moocs in general.
because even though

59
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.010 
after his first move type in
in twenty twelve there was

60
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.610 
a steady growth over the years, but
during lockdown we experience

61
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.780 
something like a second move
wave. so the topic was getting

62
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.520 
a whole new attention and this
exponential growth could be

63
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.260 
observed across all platforms
which is for example casero the

64
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.220 
largest maybe largest book
global provided. they had six

65
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.270 
hundred forty four percent increase
compared to the period a year ago.

66
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.590 
or for example just
this one month

67
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.640 
in traffic into lockdown was
more than the whole of twenty

68
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.610 
nineteen. and there were five courses with
more than one million learners enrolled.

69
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.660 
i think even one with more than two
millions, but not only consider

70
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.220 
also attacks the second
major global platform.

71
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.860 
their website now
ranks among the

72
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.810 
top one thousand websites involved
which is so mean quite an

73
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.730 
achievement. also class central
and this is the most creative

74
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.560 
work at most of the numbers from.
and they had a growth for

75
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.350 
four hundred percent and traffic
during the lockdown. so

76
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.420 
the track all the major platforms
there and so we could not

77
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.390 
only observe in terms of user numbers
and increasing growth rates

78
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.510 
and exponential growth, but also
in terms of courses offered.

79
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.080 
so we could see a lot of
universities quickly responding

80
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.860 
to the crisis and

81
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.260 
offering a whole range of new
courses for free although

82
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.710 
for certification reasons during
this crisis. there are a lot of

83
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.000 
courses offered dedicated to the topic
of copyright nineteen but not only.

84
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.420 
yeah different platforms
opened up their

85
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.710 
certification free of charge
during this time. i think this

86
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.680 
also refueled this development,
consider for example brought

87
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.480 
up course match which is
a service that maps

88
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.960 
on-campus courses of equivalent
and cosarc courses or.

89
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.930 
I think he was about to launch life
to christianity later this year,

90
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.870 
which actually allows the integration
of lectures into private classes.

91
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.290 
but coming back to the second
part of your questions. i think

92
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.350 
it was about the phone courses we
have delivered during that time.

93
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.750 
and also that was very interesting
because we had two courses.

94
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.360 
the first one was on the
topic of inntrepreneur ship

95
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.810 
which has been ruled out on the
platform by SAP and OpenSAP and that

96
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.000 
was directly before the lockdown. there
was delivered huge user response with

97
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.680 
more than six thousand people
enrolling for the course and

98
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.610 
also interesting to see that
SAP immediately responded

99
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.870 
reopen the course after
the lockdown and

100
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.050 
which gave it another boost. but then the
second course which you wrote already

101
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.500 
which i have already elaborated
on the co innovation mooc. this

102
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.600 
happened exactly during lockdown
and they thought this is really

103
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.210 
needed topic. because it's for the
entrepreneurs for the managers

104
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.160 
for the busy guys.
they don't

105
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.620 
usually internet have that much time to a
lot of additional education besides there

106
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.100 
busy schedules. but what we
observed there was and

107
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.590 
that we get a lot of uses in the course and
we had the highest completion rates ever

108
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.920 
recorded on a
platform used and

109
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.990 
then we did a quick analysis of course.
this is not confirmed yet, but

110
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.410 
one thing surely was
covir-19 lockdown so

111
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.030 
some people have more
time than usually

112
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.300 
to spend on those issues. the
second thing was which was

113
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.870 
also indicated by the lively
discussions in the forum

114
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:26.590 
and by the user feedback that we
targeted a very proactive resilience

115
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.620 
entrepreneurial pool crowd with
this MOOC. and they also showed

116
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.980 
very high resilience when it
comes to completing the MOOC.

117
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.820 
so i think it was a
combination of both.

118
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:44.540 
very interesting! would you say that
the course you gave the correlation

119
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.210 
course we talked about before
is a typical mooc or that

120
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.930 
contains additional elements which
are not so typical for moocs.

121
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.570 
maybe that's a question
tool to Agnies again. ok

122
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.240 
I'll try to answer them and for sure
Christian can add on the other side.

123
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:09.240 
if i were to think about it, i think
i would have to say three things

124
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.940 
that may be made this look
a bit the exceptional.

125
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.770 
like I said the this is a fairly
new topic. if we were doing

126
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.370 
another course on let's say csr.
we would be able to actually

127
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.780 
collect the knowledge and tap
into different knowledge both,

128
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.380 
because there will identify. in
this case we knew the knowledge

129
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.810 
and expertise is out there. but we
knew it's very much dispersed. and

130
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.230 
our goal was to make the participant
the co-creators of the course.

131
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:50.740 
so this is the first distinctive
issue that we wanted

132
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.460 
to work on hard and provide
really a platform for knowledge

133
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.480 
exchange on a massive scale. maybe
even knowledge spillovers.

134
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:07.350 
so through a set of an activities
we were able to activate

135
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.280 
people and also as his mentioned
these were really proactive

136
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.280 
and engaged the participants who
are willing to share. because

137
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.390 
it may have been the first time
that they connected on this

138
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.040 
topic on such a
massive scale.

139
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:28.240 
therefore the discussion forums are very
heated and our participants provided

140
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.840 
so many interesting
insight three garden

141
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.820 
organizational culture framworks,
trips and tips and so many

142
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.880 
examples of whole innovation projects.
both failures and success stories.

143
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.280 
so to my best knowledge we were
able to collect the probably the

144
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.070 
biggest up to date collection
of conservation examples. so

145
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.630 
this is the first issue participants
being co-creators of the fouce.

146
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:09.800 
Number two, not every mooc
creates and delivers at hand

147
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:16.270 
on a working tool and we introduced
a dedicated tool for planning

148
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.630 
the collaboration process between start-ups
and corporate, the co-innovation builder.

149
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:27.570 
it can have a type tool which
serves as a road map for

150
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.950 
a collaborative innovation project and
we put that to work during the course.

151
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:39.070 
and number three taking from
the learning from the prior

152
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:46.470 
mooc of that we were involved in together. we
redesigned it as a flexible through to track

153
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.300 
mooc. so there was the fast
track of four weeks.

154
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.200 
and then parallel to that and
then you could stop, you

155
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.190 
could take your
final exam and

156
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.820 
stop after the full weeks. still
of course engage in exchange

157
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.570 
and discussion and activities
online with the full community.

158
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:15.350 
but if you wanted more and many people did
want more, we provided two more weeks.

159
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.530 
we call it the full track with hands
on to team work where people

160
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:26.100 
in teams and make teams from
working with peers from

161
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.380 
lab around the world. they were
able to apply the coordination

162
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.160 
builder to a specific case
scenario. they were able to work

163
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.880 
together over the two weeks to deliver
a pitch, a project. and then

164
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.180 
get peer feedback.

165
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.100 
and this was very valuable for
a lot of people and they

166
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.420 
will talk of that people are
participants were also writing

167
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.400 
their reflective learning
notes in a personal notebook

168
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.820 
online. to really make them aware
of what they were learning,

169
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.770 
what they can take with them, what
they can apply in their everyday

170
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.980 
professional life. so the two or
additional weeks of the course

171
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.520 
were designed to provide a very
deep learning experience.

172
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.010 
so those are the three things
that come to my mind. but

173
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.730 
maybe christians can add
something what makes this mooc.

174
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.440 
exceptional.

175
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.430 
yeah I know fully agree here and
I would like to stress the

176
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.670 
third reason you mentioned. because
this was really surprising for us and

177
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.720 
i remember a discussion back
then, when we discussed whether

178
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.650 
to have those two additional
weeks or not. and we have also

179
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.950 
new partners in the consortium
who did not have experience

180
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:51.100 
yet with moocs and I remember I
think it wasn't even me saying.

181
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.590 
don't expect too much they won't
too many people go in the full

182
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:59.230 
tracks and those who arrive at
full track only review will

183
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.990 
actually complete the course.
but the opposite was the case

184
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.400 
in the end. so maybe it was due
to the lockdown maybe it was

185
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.910 
two to this combination of full
track is to be applied and

186
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.420 
this cool creation element and the
practitioners of the community

187
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.310 
and that really led to a completion
rate on the participation

188
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:21.880 
in the full track which was really far
beyond our high excise expectations.

189
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.060 
wow that sounds really crazy idea,
I know that the completion

190
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.340 
rates are usually for
moocs not very high.

191
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.170 
maybe you can tell us about this
what are those in numbers?

192
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.940 
i think we are moving away from
this discussion. because there

193
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.860 
was at the beginning a huge
point of critique of created a

194
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.810 
completion rate of only like
five months on September

195
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.140 
some we have 20 percent.
but it's most like the

196
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:53.610 
already the ceiling. but we
have three searches which

197
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.570 
tells us that people come on a roll from
books with differing intentions. so not

198
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.810 
only fifty percent come with the
intention of completing actually

199
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.240 
the course the others are lurkers
so they just want to get

200
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.320 
the specific content, then just
want to see what this mooc

201
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.090 
is all about. because it's for free. so
they just enrolled out of interest.

202
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.550 
so we have to already look
differently at the numbers than

203
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.590 
out of those let's say one thousand
that enroll for the course,

204
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.030 
only sixty percent of them
actually show up for the course.

205
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.990 
so we will have to look differently
at the completion rate discussion.

206
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.400 
still of course very little
completion rate might indicate

207
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:34.150 
that you actually maybe did not meet the
target group requirements or whatever.

208
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.350 
so we are also happy that that was
not the case for our experience.

209
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.710 
yeah I fully agree I think we
have to step away from looking

210
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.980 
at this index and comparing
it regular courses, because

211
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.270 
it doesn't make sense when something
is easy to access open to everyone,

212
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.860 
naturally gonna have, more
people flipping it and just

213
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.690 
having a quick look and stepping
out. because you cannt ,

214
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:05.040 
this is not possible in the
face to face courses. yeah,

215
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.290 
that's right. so, unfortunately,
we are already coming to an

216
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:15.000 
end of our interesting interview
and finally I'd like to

217
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.000 
try look ahead and ask you what do
you think about other learnings

218
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.170 
of this crisis of nineteen
overviews to university teaching

219
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.900 
and to online
learning, what

220
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.850 
through the next months
and years spraying and

221
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.820 
yeah what would remain may
be from this crisis.

222
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.460 
I can start if
you want.

223
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.330 
yeah i think we already touched
it somehow. i think first of

224
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.840 
all we need to move away from
this discussion online versus

225
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.130 
off line. I think this
digital shift covir-19.

226
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.510 
it was somewhat forced onto us
and i mean here we were all

227
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.690 
happy that we had two brilliant
options attempt to go online

228
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.600 
from almost one data to another.
but that was not the case for

229
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.080 
course designs for the technical
approaches for digital skills.

230
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.620 
because they were designed for
face to face and there was not

231
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.600 
the time to also convert them
appropriately. so now we can already

232
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.360 
hear a lot of students and also yet employees
learners and general instructors everybody

233
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.740 
logging in for face to face
interaction again. so the worst case

234
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.630 
scenario if you would like
to put it like this,

235
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:36.040 
it somehow reinforced or yeah
preconceptions or it benefits

236
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:40.310 
them in some way. I have colleagues
at my university that tell me and

237
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.370 
complained about the accomplishments
of their students significantly

238
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.120 
decreased in the last semester. but I think
it was a year too short-sighted, because

239
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:56.320 
yeah we just forced our offline
approaches into a digital core

240
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.700 
set without having experience.
and I think it would have been

241
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.040 
different if this change
which would have happened

242
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.230 
more voluntarily with more time
to plan the whole thing.

243
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.760 
but that's the problem
with this competing

244
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.510 
approach offline versus online.
so I think we all can agree

245
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.570 
that the best way would be complimentary
as you mentioned already.

246
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.580 
use the strengths of both approaches
and I'd like to think positive. so

247
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.750 
that we and i mean all of us the digital
nomads to the digital novels and whatever.

248
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.180 
we all have collected valuable experiences
with digital approaches right now.

249
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.510 
and the topic is still in the spotlight.
so with this base his sense of

250
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.230 
we can let the good things stay. we can
maybe adapt to not so good things

251
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.540 
and step arrived stage where we
can benefit from the combination

252
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.130 
of both approaches
the best way.

253
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.770 
yeah I am fully fully agree that
it's not either or if we need

254
00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:02.150 
the all kinds of formats for contemporary
education and long life learning absolutely.

255
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:07.240 
and i think of that last month
really proved to us that online

256
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:12.240 
learning is not there to take
over face to face learning

257
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.270 
format, absolutely not, but it
just provides such fantastic

258
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:22.760 
contribution to our learning
experience. and I think

259
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:28.290 
we went into the covir lockdown and we still
continue to benefit from something what

260
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.700 
the we can call social capital.
we know each other we've been

261
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.400 
working with each other and it's
easier for us to cooperate

262
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.190 
and learn together online if we
know one another for groups

263
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.370 
and teams of people. I cannot
imagine a situation we already

264
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.480 
all understand that we need
face-to-face contact

265
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.790 
to establish those deeper connections
and long lasting relationships

266
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.620 
of trust and so on.

267
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.510 
so I think my discovery is my
recent discovery is that

268
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.490 
for many people in moocs can
actually serve the purpose of

269
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.600 
establishing a learning community.
a community of people who can

270
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.080 
exchange their knowledge expertise,
who are therefore each other

271
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.730 
who are there to give each other
advice and support. this is

272
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.670 
what we observed during coverage,
during our mooc, and people

273
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.710 
really provided offensive stories
and sharing with each other.

274
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:32.260 
it was a true vibrant learning
community and it's it was great

275
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.610 
to experience it online. because
this is who we are this is

276
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:41.010 
what human beings are. we need to be
together and support each other.

277
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.310 
so moocs can also serve that purpose
and I see huge potential here.

278
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.120 
thank you very much to both of you.
so these were great insights and

279
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:58.180 
we're happy to share this with the openHPI
community within the openHPI forum and

280
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:04.670 
yeah thank you and all the best
for you! thank you so much take

281
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:10.210 
this forum, looking forward to
all the best of the form

282
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.630 
and all its
participants.

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.170 
Welcome to video clip 1.7
which concludes the first week

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.950 
and this video clip is about the
business process life cycle.

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.790 
The idea of the business
process life cycle is that

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.250 
business processes traverse
certain phases and typical

5
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.370 
business process
management projects

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.880 
and each phase focuses on specific
aspects and produce a specific

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.070 
artifact that are used for the
succeeding phase or in general

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.490 
for later phases
in this cycle.

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.720 
And an iterative repetition
of the faces is it is often

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.800 
encountered and this leads to
continued improvement of the

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.640 
business process, something that most
projects are very much interested in.

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.610 
In practice there are many variants
of the business process

13
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.470 
life cycle and we have already
seen one very simple business

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.910 
process life-cycle also in
already in the introduction

15
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.890 
of this course but also later
earlier this week and here

16
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.460 
we have presented that in the
lower part of this figure.

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.070 
And I can use them pen to make a
circle out of it because now

18
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.830 
we have just process documentation, process
improvement, process automation, process monitoring

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.490 
as important relevant activities we encountered
during process management projects.

20
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.140 
But what what we typically see
is that from process documentation

21
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.990 
we turn to process improvement.
And process documentation we

22
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.950 
create business
process models.

23
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.950 
These models basically show the
process as it is performed today.

24
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.040 
During the process improvement
step we think about improvement

25
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.700 
of the process and
which activities can

26
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.770 
be saved which additional
activities need to be performed,

27
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.480 
is there concurrency that I can take
advantage of and aspects like these.

28
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.700 
Once we process the improved business
process is available is completed

29
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.840 
we go to the process automation.
In process automation we take

30
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.730 
the improved business process we
implement it using BPMS or

31
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.230 
other software systems
in our IT architecture.

32
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.050 
Finally the process is executed
or runs and during runtime

33
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.770 
we do process monitoring, we monitor
the progress of individual

34
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.290 
process instances but
we can also monitor

35
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.620 
performance parameters like
runtime or cost incurred by many

36
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.930 
instances of one process
model for instance.

37
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.600 
Alright from monitoring we
learn opportunities to improve

38
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.020 
the process again and that enters the cycle
whether I go to documentation when

39
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.770 
document the existing process or when I immediately
go to process improvement process redesign.

40
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.140 
In any case
the process

41
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.400 
the business process life-cycle
is still iterated

42
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.820 
to go for the second for
the second iteration.

43
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.330 
That's a very simple life cycle
and but probably there are

44
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.300 
many life cycles out there in academia
we use mostly the life cycle that is

45
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.460 
shown here which is also
discussed in the BPM book.

46
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.150 
And it uses a bit of a few of
different turns but it is a bit

47
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
broader than the life cycle we've
seen before. So on the right

48
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.770 
hand side when we typically we
enter the life-cycle here where

49
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.580 
we do process design and process
analysis so documentation

50
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.660 
can be seen as a specific
kind of design.

51
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.450 
Before documenting we need to look at what
other business processes, what are the

52
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.650 
organizational business processes
and what is the level

53
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.280 
of process where there were these
beginning in the end of process

54
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.550 
or scoping of processes
is a term here.

55
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.780 
So here we start with business
process identification and modeling.

56
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.000 
And then we do business process
analysis which is validation

57
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.930 
simulation verification.
We come to these terms

58
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.140 
in a minute. So that's the first
phase we have here. Then

59
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.490 
we go to the system configuration
phase where we basically

60
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.040 
configure IT systems and organizations
so that the process can be

61
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.940 
executed as specified
in the model.

62
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.610 
And so that is the second phase the
third phase is the actual enactment.

63
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.940 
So here the runtime of the
process is represented where we

64
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.390 
have the operations where we have the
monitoring and also the maintenance

65
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.730 
of the process and of the IT infrastructure
that is used to run the process.

66
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.950 
And here we have the evaluation part
and here we do while evaluation

67
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.550 
of the running process and see
where there are opportunities for

68
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.040 
redesigning for improving
the process and with it we go

69
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.930 
into the design phase. So
basically we have together

70
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.450 
business process life
cycle which is a

71
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.090 
real cycle in this case where
we go from evaluation and back

72
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.200 
to the design.

73
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.270 
Alright now up for each of
these phases I have one slide

74
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.880 
that details what I was saying before so
let's briefly go through these slides. So

75
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.610 
analysis and design phase looks at
process design for the identification

76
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
and elicitation of business
processes is in the core

77
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.920 
say of this phase. We
explicitly document

78
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
our business process is using
business process models.

79
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.760 
But we might also add performance
metrics so we agree on

80
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.360 
with our with our colleagues
about parameters performance

81
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.680 
metrics what do we like to
measure what are the goals

82
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.550 
regarding the process performance
in terms of run-time,

83
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.960 
in terms of cost, in terms of time
that it takes to answer a customer

84
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.770 
Request. These are examples
of performance metrics.

85
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.780 
In the design phase we validate models
using reviews, discussions and simulation.

86
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.660 
So validation is quite a soft
type of analysis where

87
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.990 
agreement about the process is
in the center. So we need to

88
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.890 
agree whether whether what we have
model is exactly what

89
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.800 
we intended to model what is useful
for meeting the modelling goal.

90
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.880 
In verification we verify formal properties.
So we will talk in verification

91
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.910 
later in this course. So
verification of formal properties

92
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.990 
for instance the absence of
behavior anomalies, this is

93
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.150 
one thing we will discuss later
in this course. And analysis

94
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.540 
is made up of validation, soft
techniques like review discussions

95
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.610 
using also simulation and verification
is say verification checking

96
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.240 
for formal properties
of the process model.

97
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.960 
In this phase there are artifacts
Produced. The main artifact

98
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.490 
is the operational business process
model and also the process landscape

99
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.890 
that is used to organize in which area the
operational business process model fits.

100
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.710 
The configuration is
basically what I was

101
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.990 
discussing in the context of the
implemented business process model.

102
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.760 
So here we have organizational
aspects like performance metrics

103
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.030 
that need to be implemented at that
point, they have been designed

104
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.700 
in the design and analysis phase.
So here during configuration

105
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.160 
the performance metrics
are implemented.

106
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.650 
Also sometimes the organizational
structure of the

107
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.290 
company needs to be modified,
needs to be changed in order

108
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.000 
to allow the implementation of
the improved process. And also

109
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.300 
here we have assignment of
responsibilities and change

110
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.170 
Management. So how do we come
from the existing process

111
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.090 
to the new process? There as
let the number of changes

112
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.650 
need to be organised and change
management is a huge topic in

113
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.220 
and large organization and this
is where change management

114
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.600 
is located relative to the
business process life cycle.

115
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.350 
Related the configuration of
software systems of course using a

116
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.820 
business process management system
the system needs to be configured.

117
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.220 
The process model needs to be enriched
the execution information needs to be

118
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:54.620 
let's say integrated or deployed in
the BPMS so that the BPMS

119
00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:00.410 
can control the execution of the
process instances using the implemented

120
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.790 
process model. The enrichment
of course the process more

121
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.450 
needs to be enriched with technical
aspects and of course we

122
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.160 
need to integrate applications, we
need to integrate data, basis,

123
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.200 
we need to integrate services
and that involves the creation

124
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.220 
of adaptors to existing IT
infrastructures to your existing

125
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.970 
IT infrastructure and that also involves
coding so when it comes to software

126
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.630 
our integration we also need to code
interfaces and things like this.

127
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.520 
The output of the artifact produced
during the configuration

128
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.110 
phase is the implemented business
process model and here to sketch

129
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.660 
This, to make this slide a bit more
interesting we also added this

130
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:50.530 
XML output or XML document related
to the activity process engine

131
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.800 
The enactment phase is basically
the run-time of the business

132
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.620 
Processes. So process instances are
performed and execution data

133
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.750 
is collected.

134
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.530 
The execution data is very
important since when we collect

135
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:12.370 
the execution data we can later check
whether the process instance actually

136
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.650 
behaved where executed exactly as
specified in the process model.

137
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.950 
We can also find out about
the performance of the

138
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.590 
of the enactment and find performance
bottlenecks and things like these.

139
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.290 
So we have here the aspect for
Monitoring. So in monitoring

140
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.060 
we observe the progress
of process instances.

141
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.890 
One process instance or more general
on a number of process instances.

142
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.850 
We can identify exceptions and
deviations of the process from

143
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.800 
the process models aware where changes
and why were there changes, we can

144
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.760 
find out about changes
to the process.

145
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.590 
And the monitoring provides
information about conducted tasks

146
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.010 
also execution time and the resources
involved in the execution.

147
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.350 
Also maintenance is part of
enactment so maintenance makes

148
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.390 
sure that the process runs in
presence of system modifications or

149
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.370 
changes of services and IT
infrastructure IT systems

150
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.930 
while the process once, so these
maintenance aspects need to be taken

151
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.990 
a care of here. The artifact the main
artifact is the execution data.

152
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.740 
A final phase of the business
process life cycle is the

153
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.710 
evaluation phase and this phase
identifies weaknesses and potentials

154
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.740 
for improvement based on the
execution data that came out

155
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.150 
of the enactment phase.

156
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.020 
Here we can compare the actual
execution with the planned execution

157
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.560 
using the performance indicators that
were defined in the design phase and

158
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.540 
other than configured during system
implementation or configuration.

159
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.410 
And also process mining techniques
are used here, process mining

160
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.990 
is in academia and quite a
large topic in recent years.

161
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.900 
Also gradually techniques
of process mining are used

162
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.880 
in industries or process mining
techniques are also used during

163
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.630 
evaluation to learn about the
actual execution to relate the

164
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:27.030 
actual execution to the
process model and also identify

165
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.390 
potential for
improvement.

166
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.290 
Alright in any case or in any phase artifacts
are used as input to the succeeding

167
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.900 
phase to improve the business
process model, that is during

168
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.000 
design and analysis also improve
the process implementation

169
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.020 
during the configuration phase. So
the evaluation phase produces

170
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.310 
useful information both for the
design of the process but also

171
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.260 
for the implementation.

172
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.660 
That concludes the short video
clip 1.7 about the

173
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.480 
business process
life cycle.

174
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.410 
We discussed two different life cycles and
there are many more. Probably you have

175
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.060 
seen business process life
cycle and yourself already.

176
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.620 
We have these two life cycle
that we that we are discussing

177
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.130 
and here we have the first one
was initially used during

178
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:23.810 
the introduction of this course to
say well we need process models for

179
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.070 
process documentation with process
documentation I go to the

180
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.580 
process improvement, once I have
improved the process I can

181
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.440 
automating the process finally I can
monitor and with the monitor I can

182
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.260 
document and improve
the process again.

183
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.630 
And a bit broader in scope was
the academic process life cycle

184
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.540 
where we have design and analysis
followed by configuration

185
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.470 
followed by enactment followed
by evaluation and after the

186
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.820 
evaluation I can
design or redesign

187
00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.430 
redesign the process
and that concludes

188
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.450 
Video clip 1.7.
189
00:14:02.290 --&gt; 00:14:06.430
Finally I like to summarize
the first week of our course.

190
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.940 
We started by some fundamental
definitions regarding business

191
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.050 
Processes. regarding business process orchestrations
and business process choreographies.

192
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.990 
We took some time to talk about
the theory of modeling and

193
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.640 
we applied a theory of modeling to
process models and we found out

194
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.330 
that the properties of models are
also present for process models.

195
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.070 
We talked about interacting
business processes and found that

196
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.340 
in some cases there are deadlocks, there
are infinite waiting conditions between

197
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.630 
business processes that
interact with each other.

198
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.290 
Organizing process models
have been done but first we

199
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.220 
discuss process models and process
instances so that for each

200
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.850 
process model there can be any
number of process instances

201
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.150 
that represent the concrete cases
in the operational and business.

202
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.210 
Then we discuss process
Landscapes. These are

203
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:12.550 
maps that contain organizational business
processes and their relationships.

204
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:17.260 
And finally we discuss the business process
life cycle consisting of the main

205
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.120 
phases that we encounter during
business process management projects.

206
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.730 
That concludes the first
week of our course.

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.670 
In our openHPI course Blockchain:
Revealing the Myth, we now want

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.540 
to look to the origin problem
for inventing bitcoin.

3
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.250 
There is an
original source.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.080 
This is a paper describing the
bitcoin system and this was

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.340 
the first application what
nowadays we call the blockchain.

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.520 
So the original concept of see
bitcoin system and blockchain

7
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.770 
technology was described in the paper
of the bitcoin founder Satoshi

8
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.110 
Nakamoto. You see here they are
here that we do not know

9
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.650 
who is Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a pseudonym,
a group of researchers which designed

10
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.810 
this bitcoin system. In any case they
have changed the world by this paper

11
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.980 
"Bitcoin: a peer to
peer electronic cash system"

12
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
from Satoshi Nakamoto.

13
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
This paper was published in 2008

14
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.930 
and the problem which

15
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.720 
it likes to solve is
that in the reasoned

16
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.810 
financial system, when we
use physical currencies,

17
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.440 
when we work for example
with credit cards or with

18
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.450 
transactions from one bank account
to another, we need a trusted party.

19
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.010 
If we look how we use our
physical currencies,

20
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.770 
then there is no need for trust
between the counterparts. There

21
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.270 
is something you want
to buy, you give the

22
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.450 
merchant the money you give the
coins or the physical money and

23
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.070 
the merchant takes the money, you
take the good and then it's fine.

24
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.880 
But in any other case the merchants
need a guarantee - a guarantee

25
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.010 
that they will get money for the
reversal for their products

26
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.460 
or for their services.

27
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.010 
So here we have the need of a trusted
party in the middle that gives this

28
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.980 
merchant the guarantee that he
or she will get the money

29
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.930 
back from the buyer. So the financial
institutions act as trusted third parties

30
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.370 
and mediate between the counterparties
which want to send money

31
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.380 
from one to another.

32
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.220 
The bank needs to know the
identity of the account holder,

33
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.980 
they need to know
the merchant,

34
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.600 
want to sell a good
and needs the money

35
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.430 
and there is a lot of trust
necessary. There is an

36
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.550 
infrastructure necessary with such
trusted third party. It's a huge

37
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.020 
industrial area of our society
but when we look back to the

38
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.780 
physical currencies,

39
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.990 
it was much simpler. So
the question - can we

40
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.380 
provide a similar system
using IT technology

41
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.790 
like working with physical
currencies and not needing such

42
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.640 
an infrastructure
with a third party.

43
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.470 
Thee original problem to bitcoin is
the disclosure of personal data

44
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.380 
because the customers have to
provide more information

45
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.790 
to merchants then they would
otherwise need to. If they give

46
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.510 
the money it's not necessary for
the merchant to know the name

47
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.610 
or to know the pin of a
credit card or other things,

48
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.140 
what the buyer eventually does
not give to the merchant.

49
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.610 
So the counterparties have to disclose
their personal data to third parties,

50
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.160 
the trusted third parties, the bank
needs to know the identity

51
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.360 
of the buyer, they need to
know the identity of the seller.

52
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.420 
And this is something which is not necessary
when we work with physical currencies.

53
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.930 
So what's the problem that also
criminals can act behind the mask

54
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.140 
of bank customers? So here
the identity

55
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.600 
could be a
malicious user,

56
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.840 
buying something but
not willing to pay.

57
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.210 
So for merchants in some cases this may
mean that payment for their products

58
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.790 
for their services
can be reversed

59
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.570 
and this leads to a mediation of
disputes from this

60
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.950 
financial institution, from this
trust it's a party because the

61
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.440 
third party guaranteed the merchant that
he will get the money for his goods.

62
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.860 
And this creates costs - costs of mediation
which increases the transaction costs

63
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.090 
which is not necessary if we handle
and if we use physical currencies

64
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.380 
but as soon as we work in our world
with banks and bank accounts,

65
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.490 
such an infrastructure
costs a lot.

66
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.890 
So the cost of mediation increases
the cost of the transaction.

67
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.950 
And so it makes no sense to
use this machinery for

68
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.450 
goods which are very

69
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.070 
very cheap. So this cut off the possibility
for small casual transactions

70
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.570 
like buying a coffee
or a cake. So

71
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.160 
because to start to do this, for
example with credit card or bank

72
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:34.840 
account transactions is much
too expensive for such small

73
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.180 
interactions.

74
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:44.650 
So the raised cost due to the loss of
ability to make non reversible payments

75
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.660 
for non reversible services
is another reason

76
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.130 
that costs are increasing. So limiting
minimum practical transaction size and

77
00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.010 
the costs which are necessary
to regulate and

78
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.640 
disputes between the
counterparts in this

79
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.090 
financial system.

80
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.060 
Thus the problem of the
commerce on the internet is

81
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.870 
that it completely relies on
the financial institutions

82
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.890 
because in the internet we cannot
pay with physical currencies.

83
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.730 
So all what we mentioned before
and in the real world you have

84
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.290 
the choice to pay with
money or to make a

85
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:36.330 
transaction from your bank account,
in the commerce on the internet

86
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.750 
one has no chance to work with
physical currencies. So here

87
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:49.060 
the commerce relies exclusively
on financial institutions which

88
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:55.610 
are serving as trusted third parties
to process the electronic payment.

89
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.700 
The electronic payment
is done by transactions,

90
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:07.920 
so the limited access
to information on the third parties

91
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:14.240 
involved and the trusted third party
is a problem. So the counterparts

92
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.130 
the merchant has to trust the bank that
he will get his money for his goods.

93
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.260 
So the question is - is it possible
to do commerce in the internet

94
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.580 
without a trusted
third party?

95
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.180 
How can we take
advantage of paying like

96
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.360 
with physical currency on the
internet without such trusted

97
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.790 
third parties? This is a basic challenge
which has led to the development

98
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.500 
of the bitcoin system.

99
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.080 
So we have here our users in the
internet, the users want to sell

100
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.060 
things, they want to get paid for
their services and for their goods.

101
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.810 
So is a problem is that the fate
of the entire money system

102
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.900 
depends on the company
running the mint.

103
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.680 
With every transaction having to
go through them just like a bank.

104
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.730 
Snd so it is not clear
how this could be done

105
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.030 
and this is the
really innovative

106
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.040 
development of designing the
bitcoin system as the first

107
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.420 
at least popular
cryptocurrency.

108
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:41.940 
So the bitcoin system is a system for
electronic transactions without

109
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.300 
relying on trust.

110
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.730 
So the requirements
are as follows -

111
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:55.590 
first one needs a known currency which
is completely different

112
00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.170 
from that of the banks
or used by the banks.

113
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.720 
Then the transactions must
be publicly announced.

114
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.440 
Everyone should see what's going on to
be able to follow and see what it is.

115
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.890 
But in the moment
the transactions

116
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.860 
are publicly allowed, we
need to maintain the privacy

117
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:29.470 
of the identities of the merchants, of
the seller and buyer in the system.

118
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:37.750 
So here we have own currency, we have to
announce the transaction publicly

119
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.940 
and then we need the
anonymous identities,

120
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.310 
the anonymous identities because if
all the transaction are public

121
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.320 
then nobody should see
who is the receiver

122
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.950 
who is giver. Then
what we need

123
00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.760 
next is a secure system allowing
any two willing parties

124
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.590 
to transact directly
with each other.

125
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.660 
To send the transaction, to receive
a transaction so that the

126
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.380 
change of goods and services
becomes easy like in the case

127
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.130 
when they were paid by
physical property.

128
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.480 
So to this end we need a
solution for the participants

129
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:32.050 
to increase on a single history of the order
in which the transactions were received.

130
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.810 
So the big problem everyone
needs to trust in that system

131
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.090 
because we have no bank, we have
no cert a trusted party which

132
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:49.610 
guarantees that all works fine. Here
we have a peer to peer network,

133
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.520 
all the users are have equal
rights have equal positions,

134
00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.910 
they exchange transactions and
they need to agree

135
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:07.370 
on the transactions which were sent
and they had to agree on the order

136
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.890 
of the chronological order of
the transactions to see whether

137
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:19.230 
there is already the ability of a
user to spend money for a new good,

138
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.980 
whether this user
has enough money.

139
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:31.460 
So to sum up, the commerce on the internet relies
almost exclusively on financial institutions

140
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.700 
which serving as
trusted third parties,

141
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:41.180 
also in case and in case of
process electronic payments.

142
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:48.330 
So the system suffers from the inherent
weakness of the trust based model

143
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.190 
so the counterparties have to
disclose their personal data

144
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.360 
to the banks, the
bank needs to know

145
00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:01.970 
the persons the actors in their system
the cost of mediation increases

146
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.920 
the transaction
costs and that

147
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:13.030 
decreases the possibility to use the
system for small casual transactions.

148
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.730 
The question is how we can take advantage
of paying by physical currencies

149
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:28.940 
on the internet without using,
without relying on such a third party?

150
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.120 
So what we look as for solutions that
are independent from the third parties,

151
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.300 
what we have seen that such needs

152
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.960 
in the network
needs an own currency

153
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:52.740 
and the peer to peer
networks needs a secure system

154
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.000 
that allows any two willing
parties to transact directly

155
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.510 
and undisputably
with each other.

156
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.660 
And this makes
it difficult

157
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:11.540 
and bitcoin provides a solution
exactly for that challenge.

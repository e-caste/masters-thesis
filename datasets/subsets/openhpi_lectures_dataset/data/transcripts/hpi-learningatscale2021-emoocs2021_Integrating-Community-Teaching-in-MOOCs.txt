00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.880 
welcome everyone to this session.
we are going to discuss about

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.500 
how to integrate community teaching a system in massive open and online courses.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.590 
so my name is eva ponce.
i'm the executive director of the MITx

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.890 
the micromasters program in supply chain management.

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.380 
the co-authors of this paper are cindy, sheena a laura.

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930 
both of them are course lead as part of the micromasters team.

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.110 
and they are also researchers as part of the MIT omnichannel

8
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.280 
education lab that we are running at mit the center for transportation and logistics.

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.920 
so let me start with an overview of the program. so the micromasters

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.470 
in supply chain management is a program that

11
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.250 
we design in order to democratised knowledge. the program includes

12
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
five massive open online courses. all of them about supply chain.

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.630 
we start talking about supply chain analytics, then we move

14
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.500 
into supply chain fundamental supply chain design supply chain

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430 
dynamics, and technology and systems at the end of the program.

16
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.390 
we provide a comprehensive and final and proctor exam.

17
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.490 
we are doing that in order to ensure academic integrity and in order

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.320 
to add value to the credential.

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.850 
our program includes two type of learners. we have audit learners,

20
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.740 
and this is because our mission is to educate the world for free.

21
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.430 
so these are learners that they just need to enrolling our program.

22
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.780 
and they don't need to pay any fee.
we also have verified learners.

23
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
these are learners that they need to pay a modest fee in order

24
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.820 
to pursue for a certificate in our program.

25
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.480 
our goals is to provide the best learning experience to our learners

26
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.910 
to encourage learners through interaction, and also to inject

27
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.770 
positive energy and b courtesy and trying to answer our learners question,

28
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.970 
and help them as much as we can through the learning process.

29
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.280 
in terms of the problem we are talking here. we are facing with these paper.

30
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.830 
in our courses we have an average between ten thousand to thirty thousand learners.

31
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.010 
this includes all type of learners audited and verified.

32
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.500 
in terms of the course staff we have one course lead.

33
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.790 
this is the person who is co-ordinating the course.

34
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.250 
and we also have one mit teaching a system helping to run the course through

35
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.380 
their email accounts, through the discussion forum and helping

36
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.490 
our learners to solve their questions. But as you can see here.

37
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.510 
there is a huge gap in between the number of learners that

38
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.160 
we have and the staff that we allocate in order to run these courses.

39
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.040 
so that is what we other authors also called teacher bandwith issue.

40
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.700 
so what we did here is to integrate community teaching a system.

41
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.230 
these are volunteers. volunteers across the wall. these are learners

42
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.370 
that have already completed with us one or three or some courses
or our program.

43
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.480 
and they are volunteers to contribute to our

44
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.740 
courses helping us to moderate the photons and helping us to

45
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.560 
help our learners through these massive open and online courses.

46
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.170 
the methodology that we followed for our project, over ninety

47
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.410 
five percent of the cities recruited for a particular run have

48
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.860 
already taken the course before as learners themselves.

49
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.570 
so as such that basic demographic details like nationality
age education background

50
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.730 
are already available to us as part of initial signup survey conducted by ethics.

51
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.260 
so we use the survey results to create general insights on

52
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.100 
the profile of cities. to know more about the motivation behind

53
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.500 
volunteering for the role the benefits that they seek and the

54
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.790 
challenges that they face and other details we conducted an

55
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.680 
anonymous survey among our cities. so it included multiple choice

56
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.660 
questions and open ended questions and ranking options.

57
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.960 
so finally we considered the course leads insights to put together the

58
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.220 
processes for city recruitment training engagement defining.

59
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.770 
the tasks and responsibilities.
so let's next see the profile of the cities.

60
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.980 
so the mit micromasters and supply chain management is a global program.

61
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.000 
and so naturally rcts come from different cultural and geographical backgrounds too.

62
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.220 
so from two thousand and sixteen to jan twenty twenty-one our

63
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.780 
program has love with one hundred and seventy nine cities from

64
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.620 
forty nine countries across six continents.

65
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.030 
so at any point in the year there are more than sixty cvs engaged in total

66
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.240 
across our courses

67
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.020 
to the demographics.
now a higher percentage of our cities have a bachelor's degree

68
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.530 
while some of them have an additional master's degree.

69
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.730 
a small portion of our group also have just a high school degree when

70
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.370 
they're on bordered with us a big part of our city group belongs

71
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.300 
to the age group of twenty four to twenty nine years with a

72
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.120 
very close following by those belonging to 29 to 39,

73
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.950 
and this trend follows that of our learners as well.

74
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.560 
to next to the motivation challenges and benefits.

75
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.060 
so this was one of the insights that we gathered from the anonymous experience

76
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.650 
survey that we conducted. it was really heartening for us to

77
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.570 
see that the first and foremost reason that the CATs

78
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.820 
were motivated to volunteer for the sol was to give back to the community.

79
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.420 
so being former learners themselves the cities have seen the

80
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.180 
value in community learning and the positive

81
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.790 
impact that the teaching role can have in deeper understanding of concepts.

82
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.570 
so other important reasons which motivated the cities to volunteer

83
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.710 
was to stay connected to the staff and thus the program and

84
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.990 
also learn from each other's perspectives.

85
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.840 
so next benefit the biggest benefit which was observed by CATs

86
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.010 
was in building a network with like-minded individuals

87
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.730 
followed by staying connected with the course content learning

88
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.110 
new concepts and introduced time to time in the courses.

89
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.450 
and a single challenge which was almost agreed upon by all of our

90
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.930 
cvs was finding a balance between the regular job volunteering

91
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.560 
for this role as well as spending time with the family.

92
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.120 
Moving on to the recruitment process we have two types of recruitment process,

93
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.610 
for fresh candidates we circulate a google form at the end

94
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.380 
of a course one for interested candidates to apply. so the course

95
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.060 
lea then filters for their particular course done, and then

96
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.480 
selects the candidates based on the scores and their motivation statement.

97
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.880 
an invite is then sent to the selected candidates to confirm

98
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.370 
their approval. so this is a google form which shows the example

99
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.830 
of how we follow this process. another part is for the existing

100
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.740 
candidates and once a cv and those are community they continue

101
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.610 
to keep in touch with the staff. and so the cvs work performed well and also

102
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.040 
get recommendations from other course needs as well and based

103
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.570 
on the performance and engagement in the previous course we

104
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.210 
extend the invites to the existing cvs as well. so this is

105
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.160 
at the bottom of the screen is a snapshot of the feedback form that we made

106
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.390 
to evaluate our cvs after the course run which is helpful for

107
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.920 
us in selecting among the existing candidates.

108
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.180 
up to this point which are a little bit of why cities are super

109
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.610 
important to our community what drives them to volunteer, and

110
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.910 
how we select them.
lets you know a little bit more about their city and journey

111
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.340 
how we engage with them and how we work together.

112
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.130 
so as you mention we have a spur today hundred and seventy nine CTAs.

113
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.590 
and you can also see in the graph how much our community has

114
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.610 
grown since we started incorporating city eight back in two thousand and sixteen

115
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.040 
most of them stay with us within one and three course runs.

116
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.690 
but you can also see they stay with us as much as they are

117
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.730 
willing to do it, and even the site to stay much longer than that.

118
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.040 
we also keep track on their micromasters status when they join

119
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.940 
to our CTAs team. most of them start after completing one or two courses.

120
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.180 
but we also have many CTAs that decided to join us once they finished

121
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.410 
their program. that's also align with the importance that giving

122
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.060 
back to the community has for all our learners as we've mentioned before.

123
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.850 
and it's awesome also to see that they invest our own six hours

124
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.680 
a week to volunteer to the program.

125
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.190 
next we will show how the training process is fundamental for

126
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.990 
the CTAs is to be the bridge between learners and corso.

127
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.840 
everything we shared is of course our mission everything we do

128
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.520 
and everything we answer is always along to it. so we set the

129
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.990 
expectation we prioritize tasks and we differentiate learning from assessment.

130
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.940 
also explaining our cities that we don't just share solutions.

131
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.500 
but we do guide learners through the learning process.

132
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.920 
we also establish a single platform for direct communication

133
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.360 
where cities can always find a staff member to share any questions,

134
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.540 
feedback material or concerns.

135
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.880 
we will next move to tasks and responsibilities.

136
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.240 
our city s main task is of course to engage with learners in the discussion forums.

137
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.310 
they also have to report honor code violation and of course

138
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.530 
box in the platform. everything we all do as teams aims to ensure

139
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.680 
the best learning experience for everyone.

140
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.390 
a subset of cities that our credential holders might have access

141
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.650 
to better test some of our problems in advance.

142
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.900 
and also everyone can bring projects to help us improve our course.

143
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.330 
finally this all bring us to the engagement process.

144
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.460 
our weekly meetings of less than an hour will be the moment of providing updates

145
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.510 
videos on the course titles where the deejays will share feedback

146
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.370 
on their experience and that experience could be without the

147
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.970 
content with the platform or with the learners.

148
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.190 
also we all share ideas for course improvement they engage

149
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.740 
in additional activities, and for example they can propose discussion for materials.

150
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.950 
they are also allowed and invited of course to attend studio

151
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.930 
events or bring some on any solutions they think of

152
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.140 
to our learners most frequently asked questions.

153
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.960 
overall our entire team from direct source of the program to the TAs

154
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.950 
acknowledging every opportunity conference or platform they have access to.

155
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.580 
the added value from the CTA to the community.

156
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:42.170 
an know let me and reward process is a very key part of this

157
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.950 
engagement process with our community to teaching assistance.

158
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.300 
one of the things we are doing at the end of the course is

159
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:54.080 
evaluating their level of engagement with our learners and with the staff.

160
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:59.530 
based on that evaluation we wore a certificate of excellence.

161
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.950 
and the purpose of that is to recognize all of their contributions

162
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.640 
and the efforts to help us to conduct to manage these courses

163
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.630 
and to provide a high touch experience through our program to our

164
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:18.010 
learners. we want also to thank them by name recognize in our

165
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.440 
newsletter with sometime pause our links being a pause just

166
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.750 
say thank you for your excellent work.

167
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.010 
also we conduct once per year with the directors of the t of the program

168
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.610 
a city appreciation event. so we're trying our best in order

169
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.010 
to recognize the efforts intense of the lessons learned. and

170
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.910 
our recommendations if you are planning to incorporate community teaching a system

171
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.300 
in your courses. first of all

172
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.770 
we believe that is very important to make CTA to feel

173
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.310 
special and valued for their contributions to the program.

174
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.330 
we put some effort and the course team are putting a lot of effort in order to

175
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.170 
share updates with our CTAs and keep them informed about

176
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.960 
the progress of the course. we also pay a special attention

177
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.040 
to listen to them. we have a very value and experienced CTA

178
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.500 
they are professionals. and they are bringing their experience

179
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.640 
the knowledge to our programs so we need to recognize that

180
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.720 
we actively take their feedback they feel that their feedback

181
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.660 
is very important for us. and based on that we are improving

182
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:35.350 
our courses every single time that we are running a new class for our courses.

183
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:40.650 
we try also to support back our cities in the discussion forum.

184
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.220 
and also we are available for them through

185
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.580 
slack or email in order to answer any questions or concerns

186
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.870 
that they might have. so i believe that all of these four contribute

187
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.020 
to have them engage with our program.

188
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.610 
in terms of the next step of this paper, we are planning to

189
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.240 
include CTA interviews to better understand their motivation.

190
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.090 
and to foster engagement practices accordingly to do that. The second

191
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:16.750 
thing we are planning to do is to further expand on a staff and learners feedback

192
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.290 
regarding the impact of CTAs in order to create these a

193
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:26.620 
learning journey that we want to create through these courses. so in conclusion

194
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.880 
we are immensely thankful to our community of teaching a system.

195
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.020 
because they are the bridge in between our staff and our learners.

196
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.030 
they are helping our learners they are engaging with our program.

197
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.450 
and they are bringing their ideas in order to improve our program.

198
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.950 
so let's say that they play an instrumental or key role in

199
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:53.170 
order to provide a high that experience through massive open online courses.

200
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.340

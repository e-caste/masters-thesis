2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.160 
So, I would like to welcome you to our last week,
to the fifth week of our online learning

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.960 
course and in the
the first four weeks

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.440 
we tried to zoom a little bit out to get

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.840 
the idea of the bigger picture, of the
paradigm shift we are in right now.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.080 
And then we focused on three core things,

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.520 
which we considered to be
the most important to change.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.520 
We are looking at flexibility of spaces.
How can we do this?

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.560 
We're looking on collaboration,
power of teams, on a team of teams mode

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.480 
and also on making processes more
iterative and run through and do loops.

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.160 
Exactly.

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.640 
And as you have been experiencing it,
design thinking

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.000 
can not just only be used to actually create
innovation opportunities by using

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.000 
a process with people
in a specific environment.

15
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200 
But also and this is what we want
to address right now, zooming in.

16
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.840 
It can actually help as a leading
principle of change, and remembering

17
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.120 
the little metaphor I came up with at
the beginning, the network structure.

18
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
Let's use that to think of how to connect,
to interconnect people with each other

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
in the organization, to connect
with your neighbor, for example.

20
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.800 
But you can also use it for thinking

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
of connecting parts of your
organizations, the departments.

22
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.080 
And while doing this,
you might reconsider the whole

23
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.400 
departmental structure
of your organization.

24
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.320 
But you can also use that thinking
of connecting your organization,

25
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.760 
your company with other companies
and building a company network.

26
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.400 
So let's dive deeper
into those four layers.

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.640 
The first one is about connecting people
and what we're about to change here,

28
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.560 
if you use design
thinking for this purpose, is actually

29
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.760 
starting to meet and to work
on EYE-LEVEL altogether.

30
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.040 
That also means it becomes far more easier

31
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.760 
to exchange information,
but also to share implicit knowledge

32
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.240 
across department boundaries
and also to build on a culture

33
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.760 
of collaboration that is
driven by shared leadership.

34
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.800 
And if it comes to building new ties

35
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.160 
between the different parts
of the organizations like the departments,

36
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.720 
we see large organizations
doing very significant steps.

37
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.240 
We are accompanying a large global player

38
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.280 
who is just rebuilding the internal
structure towards a cross-functional team

39
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.880 
structure, and they get people out of their
silos, bring them together on a temporary

40
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.200 
base and work on the solution
of complex innovation challenges.

41
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.160 
And while they were reorganizing their

42
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.360 
organization towards a cross-functional
teams mode,

43
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.640 
they found out that the hierarchy
level needed also to be addressed.

44
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.400 
They had seven hierarchy levels before and
two of them were actually not necessary.

45
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.680 
Actually hindering the more flexibility

46
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.160 
they were gaining through
the new structure.

47
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.680 
So one of our key learnings specifically

48
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.680 
in this case was that it's no longer
when it comes to organizational change.

49
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.880 
Then about finding a new model that's
completely replacing the old one.

50
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.880 
And then will be kept in the future
as the new static model.

51
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.400 
Instead, it's about creating a dynamic
form of an organization that actually

52
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.720 
keeps the organization agile
and also in constant flux.

53
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.320 
However, this also requires a lot.

54
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.600 
Because you keep on questioning yourself.

55
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.480 
also from a strategic perspective,

56
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.480 
now more or less on a day to day basis.

57
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.160 
And that's what most of the organizations
nowadays are not ready for in terms

58
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.840 
of to establish an agile culture within
their whole network of people,

59
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.280 
of cross-functional teams
and organizational units.

60
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.680 
And this is actually very important

61
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.960 
to realize, because a lot of organizations
who are approaching us and looking at this

62
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.240 
pattern and they want to move from
Brockhaus to a more flexible structure.

63
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.680 
They consider first.

64
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.440 
Oh, this is a very chaotic thing.

65
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.960 
And second step might be that they think,
oh, they should adapt this as

66
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.280 
a static structure as they do as
they use right now, the Brockhaus.

67
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.640 
This is not what we are meaning it.

68
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.920 
Actually, there are very good examples

69
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.160 
now. There is a large Chinese company,
for example, through the last five years,

70
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.880 
they changed their whole
organization towards:

71
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.240 
they call it an ecosystem
of micro-enterprises.

72
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.760 
So what they did actually,

73
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.760 
they are not just connecting
single people in the organization,

74
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.440 
they start to build up little companies
with CEOs and build a new ecosystem.

75
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.520 
a highly flexible,

76
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.240 
dynamic ecosystem,
which is acting globally now and

77
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.800 
innovating and coming up
with new home appliances ideas.

78
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.800 
And what does this radical example
of changing your innovation

79
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.200 
and organizational ecosystem
actually learns us?

80
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.000 
It actually helps us to see that you can

81
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.240 
establish even more
ties with others outside your company,

82
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.120 
either people or teams,
but also other organizations.

83
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.640 
So therefore, you have even more open

84
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.720 
and no longer closed boundaries
to insights, inspirations and also other

85
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.560 
examples you can learn from and you
can tie also your organization to.

86
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.120 
But what if you can't be that radical or
you don't want to risk being that radical

87
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.720 
in the first place? Well, then
start small and iterate.

88
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.200 
Start with creating this open boundaries
to the partners you already have,

89
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.600 
either along the value chain or also
across your value network,

90
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.520 
because that can actually help you to gain
also new inspirations and also

91
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.440 
to experiment with new forms of organizing
the collaboration across organizations.

92
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.400 
And through the last years,

93
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.160 
we could actually see very
interesting examples towards this.

94
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.760 
There is one large pharmaceutical

95
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.480 
organization approaching us and they were
kind of redefining themselves beyond

96
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.080 
the pill and they were booking
several student projects.

97
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.080 
And while they were doing those student

98
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.760 
projects, they like very much this kind
of cross-disciplinary idea,

99
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.240 
bringing people together
from very different disciplines.

100
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.200 
And they saw the creative impact this has.

101
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.520 
And what they came up with is
with the idea of building up a cross

102
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.040 
industry network towards health
issues, health care problems.

103
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.040 
And this kind of virtual network is up

104
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.280 
and running since several years now,
and it's generating highly interesting

105
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.520 
bilateral and multilateral
innovation approaches.

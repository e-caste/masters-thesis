1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.320 
Let's consider different types
of malware on the Internet.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.820 
malware we introduce
the notion already

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.800 
it comes from malicious software.
And it's named software.

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.150 
Usually is smuggled by hackers onto
an unsuspecting users device.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.900 
It could be a laptop. It
could be a smartphone, via

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.340 
the internet, via
internet connections

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.360 
which enables the cyber attacks,
which enable the cyber

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.260 
crimes to attack that systems
where they were able to

9
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.020 
get infiltrated with malware.
There are well known examples

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.280 
of malware. There are viruses,
worms, trojans, and

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
botnets, rootkits, adware,
spyware to prolong

12
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.100 
the list. And we will
go into more detail

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.970 
in this video speaking about the
different types and seeing

14
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.840 
what are the characteristics.
Let's start with a malware

15
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.190 
type of viruses. Viruses are harmful
mini-programs. Harmful mini-programs are

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.890 
that integrate themselves
into existing programs.

17
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.650 
The program is called
the host program.

18
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.250 
The malware,
the viruses

19
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.750 
integrate into this program.
In the effect, they falsify

20
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.270 
or they change the host program.
Sometimes integration of

21
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.180 
malware even takes place without
changing the size or the date

22
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.050 
of the last modification. Typically
if this program is changed

23
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.410 
or something is changed
then one can see this.

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
For example in the last
modification date

25
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.830 
or one can see this in the
size. So viruses are

26
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.830 
designed that often they integrate
into the host program,

27
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
but do not change the size
or modification date.

28
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.840 
Problem such as harmful
mini-programs with such virus is

29
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.110 
that they multiply themselves locally,
by means of seeing host's program

30
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.580 
so the reproduction has a particular
effect on the performance

31
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.560 
of the infected system. It
becomes slow and it's no more

32
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.060 
efficient. But they
could be also other

33
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.300 
bad effects caused by
the virus malware.

34
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.840 
so viruses can affect the
workability of the system at all

35
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.270 
computers and laptops the
smartphone what device

36
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.140 
you are using. Another type
of malware is worms.

37
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.310 
worms are malicious programs,
which spread themselves

38
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.720 
independently over the network
or via removable media,

39
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.280 
for example USB sticks. This type
of malware is able to start

40
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.000 
themselves after further
transmission. So the user

41
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.470 
does not have to a
expressively agree

42
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.030 
to the execution. The worm starts
to do its work without such

43
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.350 
an start point. Often
worms spread faster

44
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.140 
than viruses. The difference to
viruses is that worms work

45
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.950 
independently. So they do
not need a host program.

46
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.560 
The following executions, payload
often has wasteful effects

47
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.130 
on the affected systems, for example,
the impairment of performance

48
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.530 
supposed installation
of another malware.

49
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.600 
Backdoors are opened. Infected
computer became a bot.

50
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.430 
In a botnet, all this
could be reached

51
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.150 
by means of attacks, by means of
worms. The next types of malware

52
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.360 
are trojans or trojan
horses. The term trojan

53
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.850 
refers to computer
programs which hidden

54
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.590 
malicious functions masked
as useful applications.

55
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.610 
Like in the history,
the trojan horse,

56
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.200 
the malware looks
different from what

57
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.340 
it is doing. When the
supposedly benign

58
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.890 
an application is started. The
malicious function is automatically

59
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.030 
executed, partly parallel to
executed functionality,

60
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.670 
to remain unnoticed
by the user.

61
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.030 
So in this way, trojans can
also camouflage themselves

62
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.400 
as documents or as files. So
here the characteristic

63
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.610 
is the hidden malicious functionality
which characterizes as

64
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.120 
trojans. So the malicious function
is executed when the document

65
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.070 
or the file is opened. The malicious
function could consist in that

66
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.840 
a login page is shown. But it's
not the right login page.

67
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.480 
That is then faked
login page, so that

68
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.580 
if the user types in the
password username,

69
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.230 
then the trojan can take this
data and send it for example

70
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.670 
to the attacker. So as an example, a
similar example, the fake facebook

71
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.720 
app, for android phone to access
username and password combination.

72
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.200 
And later on to misuse
this combination.

73
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.240 
Another type attacking
another part of the system

74
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.100 
are the so-called keylogger. A
keylogger is a mini-program

75
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.020 
that recalls all user's keystrokes.
So more powerful variants,

76
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.810 
also capture the contents
of the screen.

77
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.160 
So that later on the
attacker can compare

78
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.380 
the screen with what the user
is doing on his keyboard.

79
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.680 
Recalling the keystrokes
is carried out.

80
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.970 
When some sensible information
is given in. For example,

81
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.980 
when a password input field
appears on the screen,

82
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.250 
and then the user makes
keystrokes. Typically you user

83
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.360 
fill in the password. So
maybe recording keystrokes,

84
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.650 
the user the attacker has a
chance to get the users

85
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.570 
password. The recorded user inputs
are then stored in a file

86
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.970 
which is accessible for the
attack or which is directly

87
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:59.210 
sent to the attacker. The attacker
can misuse such information that

88
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.400 
we discussed this in detail
for the identity theft

89
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.350 
for bank transfer, remembered
in the course week 2, we have

90
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.280 
already spoken about
such keyloggers.

91
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.440 
Now let's have a look to
botnets, another form

92
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.710 
a variant of malware. Such a
botnet is a combination of

93
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.360 
many many different systems.
The systems are called bots.

94
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.340 
Typically the system
are recruited without

95
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.010 
the knowledge of the
owner of that system.

96
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:41.340 
Then there is a C&amp;C server
and "command and control

97
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.500 
server". This command and
th control server is

98
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.720 
in the hand of the attacker.
From this, by means of this

99
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.320 
C&amp;C server, the attackrt
remotely manages coordinates

100
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.570 
and controls, the many bots.
So by means of C&amp;C server

101
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.450 
the attacker is able
to send a command

102
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.000 
to the huge number
of different

103
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.320 
systems. For example, to try to
access the system or to other

104
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.990 
activities. The C&amp;C server,
the commander control server

105
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.940 
takes the control over
the bots and sends

106
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.850 
commands to the bots, which then
are executed automatically

107
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:31.730 
and autonomously. So
the user or owner

108
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.080 
of the bot computer does not know
that the system is started

109
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.670 
to work autonomously. For
example and starting a denial

110
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.330 
of service attack or doing
other kind of attack.

111
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.720 
So bot nets with many and many means
millions of remote controlled

112
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:57.230 
bots can perform a variety of
attacks, very dangerous attacks

113
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.230 
with high computational
power. Because

114
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:08.080 
all the millions of bots can work
together, for example, for

115
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.500 
to start an encryption part
or to start a denial

116
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.400 
of service attack or
to do some others

117
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:21.230 
and from the attack system. The
computational control server

118
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.990 
is not seen. But the
bots are seen.

119
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.240 
And the bots there,
people, the owner

120
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.810 
are not often aware that their
computers are bots. We will

121
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.430 
continue to discuss
about this in more

122
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:44.120 
detailed video on botnets.
Here the idea is first to

123
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.790 
start with an overview about
the different types of

124
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.940 
malware. And the next what we
have to discuss and introduce

125
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:58.700 
are rootkits and back doors. A
rootkit is a malicious software

126
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.370 
that gives the attacker the
possibility to continuously access

127
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.710 
the compromised system. The
laptop or the company system

128
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:18.710 
or the mobile device. Usually
such rootkits are installed

129
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.250 
when a system is breached. So
this is often the idea of

130
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.850 
such an attack to
install such a rootkit

131
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.240 
to later be able,
to have access

132
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.800 
to the computer system
without knowledge

133
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:40.820 
of the owner of the system. So
rootkit tries to conceal its

134
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.430 
own existence, existence
on the system.

135
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.690 
So it is able to open
connection. It is able to mask

136
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.920 
certain files and it's able
to hide other malicious

137
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.810 
programs from the users. For
example, for the anti-virus

138
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.130 
system of the divided
software of the system.

139
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:10.130 
Beside of the rootkits, is the back
door. It is important the backdoor

140
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.690 
that allows an attacker to
gain unauthorized access

141
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.990 
to a third party computer system.
So the idea of such a rootkit

142
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:24.870 
is, to install a backdoor. Such back
doors are very attractive force

143
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.040 
cybercriminals. Because they do
not have one time access to

144
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.560 
the system. They can control
they see what's going on the

145
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.620 
system and they can
interact and remotely

146
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.700 
change things
or see things

147
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.420 
on the system when they have such
a backdoor, so that they have

148
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.070 
a hidden access
to the system.

149
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.000 
Adware is another type of
malware. Adware is a program

150
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.290 
that displays advertising, in addition
to the actual functionality.

151
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.070 
So adware can also be integrated
into the web browser

152
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.500 
which makes it possible to
display advertisements on every

153
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.780 
web page. So this is
not an advertisement

154
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.170 
coming from the server of that
web page and from the provider

155
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.290 
of that page, it comes
from the malware.

156
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.330 
Malicious software that adware
that uses advertising, is also

157
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:31.350 
referred to as a adware. For
example, browser plug-ins

158
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.590 
then embedded javascript with
ads on each page and others.

159
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.710 
Another type of my malware
is so-called Spyware.

160
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.620 
Spyware is a software that
sends sensitive data to third

161
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:51.680 
parties without consenting of the
owner. For example, Spyware

162
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.410 
from user information to
the software manufacture.

163
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.970 
If a user uses

164
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.530 
an application. It's possible
by means of the spyware to

165
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.380 
send all the activities to the
software manufacturers that gives

166
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.680 
him an idea how this is used,
the spyware can send sensitive

167
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.520 
information to web service
provider, also through government

168
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.460 
agencies, foreign intelligence
services and others.

169
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.540 
So spyware is also referred
to as Spy software.

170
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:33.040 
As snooping software or spy programs.
Here is the data transmission.

171
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.810 
The transmission of the sensitive
data is taking place in

172
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.640 
secret. Often such
spyware is used

173
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.750 
to display personalized advertising
and following the surfing.

174
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.470 
The surfing behaviour of
the user. But it can also

175
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.760 
used to get information
about personal data.

176
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.510 
For example, passwords or
credit card data or other

177
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.110 
secret data in the
private life, also

178
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.750 
developments materials and others
which are from a company.

179
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.180 
Scareware another
type of another

180
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.200 
mal functionally another
type of malware

181
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.450 
which it tends to frighten users,
by taking error messages,

182
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.230 
by showing virus infections
or other problems.

183
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:37.260 
The idea is that
particular current or

184
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.040 
prominent viruses and
error messages are used

185
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.870 
to make the threat as
dramatic as possible.

186
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.310 
So the user gets the information
that his computer systems

187
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.530 
are infected without such
an infection to place.

188
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:59.480 
Then the user, to threat
the user and to do this

189
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.310 
dramatically. The software asked
for banalities to repair

190
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:11.230 
this defect. For example,
to replace the viruses.

191
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.530 
So a typical approach.
Here is an example,

192
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:21.660 
that listing legal Infringement
on the user in the

193
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.660 
name of the police.
And then a penalty

194
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.720 
is asked for
repairing this.

195
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.750 
Antivirus, Rogueware/
Rogue antivirus malware.

196
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.050 
This is a standalone program
or Rogueware that the

197
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:47.600 
the standalone program that
fakes a trustworthy source

198
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.000 
to get sensitive information
on money. So preventing the

199
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.570 
cleaning of the computer while
introducing malicious programs

200
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:02.750 
or stealing data. The rogue antivirus
is a special type of rogueware

201
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.100 
that camouflage itself as
an anti-virus program.

202
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:14.000 
The idea behind this is that it scans,
it claims to scan the computer

203
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.540 
,then it really finds
various malicious software

204
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:24.280 
which is not, which is
not on the system.

205
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:29.980 
And in reality, there is no
real scheme scan performed.

206
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.440 
But the infections are
reported. For example,

207
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.660 
even if the system is for
free to request money,

208
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.380 
for repairing the system. So the
user often prompted the type

209
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.600 
of malware and say yes
I sent some money

210
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:55.640 
for repairing my computer.
Ransomware is another type

211
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.980 
of malware. It is a malicious
program that prevents the users

212
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.980 
from accessing his or her own
data and extorts money.

213
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.490 
The idea behind this is that
the data are encrypted.

214
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.120 
The idea of that
ransomware is

215
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.720 
to encrypt the personal data
on the users computer,

216
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.760 
so that the user is no more able
to understand the data, to

217
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.480 
get the data and to work
with the data. Then

218
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:30.080 
the attackers, they
get an offer

219
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.760 
for decryption of that data. So
that he or she can get back

220
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:42.040 
his or her data. But of
course, there is a request,

221
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.150 
there is a request that
for this service

222
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.530 
the user has to pay. There
is a general agreement

223
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.030 
among hints that are given
by security experts

224
00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.020 
that they advise not to pay.
Because often it's not

225
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.940 
clear whether the user really
gets back it's data,

226
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.210 
whether the data really are
decrypted or whether it's

227
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.890 
only the way to get
data. So infections,

228
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.450 
by means of such ransomware
is done by email

229
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.050 
attachments, by trojans
or by our some malware.

230
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.760 
In this case, a prevention
method is that one

231
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.410 
needs to take care that the
data are regularly backed up

232
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.320 
on all important data. So
that even if an attacker

233
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.140 
is able to infiltrate the system
with ransomware and decrypt,

234
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.580 
encrypt all the personal data
that one can then get back

235
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.270 
the data from the back up,
and has not to discuss

236
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.320 
with the attacker about
giving it today,

237
00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.080 
giving it back. I also
could continue further

238
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:05.410 
types of such
malware. It should

239
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.860 
show you the big variety of mal
functionality and have different

240
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:17.440 
ideas attackers have, to do
some malicious functionality

241
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.180 
on your computer. If we look
at malware attacks today,

242
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.610 
then we have to say
that's not so easy,

243
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.800 
to say today's software belongs
to that category or to this

244
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.330 
category. So what we see
is that the reason

245
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:42.790 
malicious malware is no longer
be assigned explicitly

246
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.660 
to one of the name
types. Usually

247
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.100 
they reasoned malware
comes with various

248
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:56.060 
malicious functions which are
used to attack the attacker

249
00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.670 
and which comes in
different categories.

250
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.660 
In some case, even the malware
is designed in a way

251
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.500 
those additional components
and additional malfunctions

252
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.750 
can be uploaded. An example
let's have a look at the well

253
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.310 
known carberp malware which
contains various functions.

254
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.620 
Functions of trojan, functionalities
of keylogger, a functionalities

255
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:29.490 
of the rootkit, of the backdoor
all comes within one malware.

256
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.720 
So here you see there is a great variety
of different mal functionality

257
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.340 
coming with different
malicious software.

258
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.110 
And here we have to discuss all
these attack possibilities

259
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.630 
in more details in
the next video.

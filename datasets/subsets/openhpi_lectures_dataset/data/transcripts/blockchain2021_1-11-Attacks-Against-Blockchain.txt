1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.880 
In our openHPI course Blockchain - Revealing the myth.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.359 
We also have to discuss about attacks, attacks against

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.063 
blockchains, and the reason is Bitcoin blockchain, other

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.970 
blockchains, IT systems, in general, are

5
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.603 
not unhackable.

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.753 
There are possibilities for the attacker to attack such systems

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.988 
and if we consider blockchain and bitcoin blockchain

8
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.980 
, then we have two levels of attacks.

9
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.420 
So, one attack level is that attacks against peer to peer

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.364 
applications are also valid and have

11
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.882 
to be considered in the context of the Bitcoin blockchain.

12
00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:54.350 
Blockchain Is based on a peer to peer network and here

13
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.969 
there are a number of attacks against such peer

14
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.139 
to peer applications.

15
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.599 
And then there are other attacks against the blockchain and

16
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.541 
these are attacks against the consensus

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.799 
algorithm. We spoke in detail about the proof of work, how

18
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.099 
the blocks are formed and produced,

19
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.310 
and that the way how it's done with this security challenge,

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.619 
which is a hashing challenge that needs to be computed.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.659 
And the rule is that the longest blockchain will

22
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.849 
win, this is a way to get a consensus

23
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.890 
between all of the users of such a peer-to-peer

24
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.080 
network, bitcoin network.

25
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.610 
And here all the attackers try to attack these

26
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.738 
mechanisms to form and

27
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.218 
to get a consensus among the users of such

28
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.139 
a peer to peer application that do not trust each other.

29
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.247 
And we want to consider here, the following two basic

30
00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.577 
attacks, the eclipse attack and the 51%

31
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.259 
attack to see in more detail

32
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.930 
how the attacker tried to attack such bitcoin

33
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.699 
and blockchain systems. The eclipse attack is an attack

34
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.289 
against the peer to peer network and you remember, we

35
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.789 
have our peers in the network peers has connections to

36
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.740 
other peers, the number of these connections is

37
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.439 
restricted and what the attacker tries to do is monopolize

38
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.449 
the connections of a victim.

39
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.119 
So, when they want to attack here one of the users,

40
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.979 
they try to influence to get connected to the

41
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.259 
user in a way that the user only sees

42
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.739 
the information he/she gets from the attackers.

43
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.896 
So, the attacker attempts to be the only one connected

44
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.879 
to the victim, then they can give him a wrong impression

45
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.149 
of what's going on in the network.

46
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.739 
They can give the user

47
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.889 
the view they like to give him/her.

48
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.469 
Those attackers can then forward selected

49
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.922 
blocks, they can forward selected transactions,

50
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.499 
they can forward manipulated transactions and

51
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.440 
they can shut out the victim from the network and manipulate

52
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.899 
the victims' view on the blockchain.

53
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.050 
So, this is an attack in the field of peer to peer networks and

54
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.999 
with the reason that the user in a network

55
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.289 
is not connected to all the other users, it is only connected

56
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.014 
to a subset of this network. The Bitcoin clients

57
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.159 
have 2 types of connections, the one is connections

58
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.719 
initiated by themselves, these are the outgoing connections,

59
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.635 
and then they have connections requested by other users,

60
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.370 
these are the incoming connections.

61
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.769 
And exactly this is the idea to avoid such

62
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.978 
kind of attack, such kind of eclipse attack that the attacker,

63
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.019 
the malicious user tries to manipulate in

64
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.769 
one user of the network by monopolizing the connections

65
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.759 
of this user to the rest of the network.

66
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.079 
The other attack I want to explain

67
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.109 
is the 51% attack: If

68
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.150 
an attacker in a blockchain-based system has more than 50%

69
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.540 
of the total resources, then

70
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.970 
the following manipulations of the blockchain are possible.

71
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.519 
What are the resources in such a blockchain-based system?

72
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.020 
Resources are the computing capacity - computing capacity,

73
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.990 
you'll remember in the Bitcoin network the consensus algorithms

74
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.809 
run by a very computationally

75
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.519 
intensive block creation process, this is the proof

76
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.578 
of work and into the next week we will see

77
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.630 
in more details that other ways, other consensus

78
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.659 
algorithms are also applicable to

79
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.679 
blockchain systems. For example, the portion of coins

80
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.109 
the user's own. So, there are other consensus,

81
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.279 
algorithms but the idea here of attack every time is the same.

82
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.368 
If the attacker has more than 50% of the resources, in

83
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.006 
that case, proof of work that is the computing capacity and in the case of

84
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.589 
proof of stake that is the portion of coins, then it is possible

85
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.746 
to manipulate the blockchain. The idea is to

86
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.709 
monopolize the mining process, the process

87
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.850 
of creating new blocks and when

88
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.128 
the attacker is able to do this, then he/she can keep the rewards, the

89
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.679 
block creation rewards exclusively for

90
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.440 
him/herself, he/she can

91
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.329 
influence the common view on the blockchain by asserting

92
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.800 
his/her own blockchain as the longest chain, he/she can

93
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.414 
invest the most resources and can claim that the longest

94
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.119 
chain, the chain that gives trues, the common

95
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.139 
understanding of all the participants in the work transactions

96
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.139 
by the user. For example, he/she can let out

97
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.356 
some transaction of other users, he/she may not

98
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.106 
include certain blocks. So, he/she can manipulate the truth into

99
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.451 
the network and an example here

100
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.069 
is that the attacker in this way can spend his/her

101
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.029 
block, his/her bitcoins in a double

102
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.519 
for several things, typically, this is called double-spending.

103
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.828 
So, this procedure is also known

104
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.750 
as the 51% attack and

105
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.455 
the different consensus algorithms are in different ways vulnerable

106
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.208 
against attack. So, the proof of stake, this is the

107
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.884 
portion of the coins that are owned by the attackers, is

108
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.906 
more vulnerable against this 51% attack compared to the

109
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:35.179 
proof of work consensus algorithm.

110
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.504 
Let's consider an example of the double-spending attack: A cheater

111
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.389 
tries to reuse his/her already issued values

112
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.734 
several times. So, let's imagine that the malicious user

113
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.869 
has bought expensive photographic equipment

114
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.200 
for, let's say, half a Bitcoin

115
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.269 
and let's assume that his/her transactions to the seller

116
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.090 
of Bitcoins are recorded in block number

117
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.407 
700.000, then you remember after 6

118
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.131 
blocks the transaction is considered to be confirmed.

119
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.147 
So, after 6 blocks the seller says 'Ok', there is an order

120
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.218 
of such Photo equipment and this

121
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.529 
order is confirmed. So, he sends the goods

122
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.860 
to the user.

123
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.759 
In the meanwhile, the attacker, the cheater receives the

124
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.779 
Photo equipment, say, after half-day, the

125
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.392 
cheater wants to get back the money he/she spent

126
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.170 
and to do this, he/she creates a new transaction, a

127
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.042 
transaction in which he transfers the half Bitcoin already

128
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.679 
spent to him/herself.

129
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.829 
Both transactions, the old and the new have the same

130
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.410 
input and he/she

131
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.864 
puts this transaction also in a new block with

132
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.848 
the number 700.000, so that the old

133
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.070 
transaction is not contained.

134
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.210 
Let's assume a half-day, we had about 10 minutes

135
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.314 
for the creation of a new block, so we have 12 hours and

136
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.178 
6 blocks created. So, after half-day,

137
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.670 
72 new blocks have already been created, which are following

138
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.570 
the earlier block with a number 700.000.

139
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.279 
Now the cheater wants to manipulate the

140
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.099 
700.000 blocks, but he/she cannot, he/she cannot simply

141
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.294 
change the whole block against the new block because the

142
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.850 
new block with the other transaction has a new hash value.

143
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.099 
So, everyone could see that is not the original block,

144
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:28.169 
that's a new block and even worse, all the following

145
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.169 
72 blocks which are based on the old block

146
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.879 
with the number 700.000, need to be

147
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.504 
recalculated to get a correct hash chain.

148
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.389 
So, if the attacker, the cheater wants to exchange the block number

149
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.640 
700.000 for a new block, he/she has from the

150
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.436 
block 700.000, all the following, in our case 72

151
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.880 
blocks created in a new way so that they have

152
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.423 
the correct hash chain.

153
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.589 
But this is not enough, the malicious use must also enforce

154
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.156 
the new chain until it is longer than

155
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.570 
the other chains.

156
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.450 
So here, you see, if the cheater succeeds,

157
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.210 
it would look like that, he/she never sent his/her money to the seller of

158
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.799 
photo equipment at the moment he/she is able to manipulate

159
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.579 
the blockchain in the described way.

160
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.150 
And to this end, he/she needs more resources, more

161
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.940 
in our case, proof of work - Bitcoin, needs more computational resources

162
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.264 
than the other users of the blockchain.

163
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.809 
To summarize this, we have looked

164
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.879 
at 2 examples of attacks, 2 types of examples

165
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.671 
of attacks against the blockchain.

166
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.635 
So where the one type are the attacks against

167
00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.100 
the consensus algorithms, this was the double-spending.

168
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.618 
And the other type of attacks against blockchain is the attack

169
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.259 
against the network, the peer-to-peer network.

170
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.989 
And most effective attacks, of course, try

171
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.450 
to combine these two types.

172
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.900 
But if we look at the history and there were some attacks

173
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.279 
against Bitcoin and if we look at what's happened with blockchain in general,

174
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.043 
the biggest problem is the user, the

175
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.952 
user of blockchain, the user in this peer to peer network.

176
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.130 
Oftentimes the user is the weakest

177
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.610 
part of the system.

178
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.820 
So, for example, we have seen successful attacks by

179
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.979 
tricking users to make wrong transactions, to

180
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.530 
prompt transactions, or by tricking users

181
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.389 
to steal their private key which is, of course,

182
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.889 
necessary, and other things.

183
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.160 
So, blockchain systems can also be attacked,

184
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.170 
we need to know this. And the typical attack against blockchain

185
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.503 
are attacks against peer to peer network, against peer to

186
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.799 
peer character of the application and against the consensus algorithm

187
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.178 
of the blockchain.

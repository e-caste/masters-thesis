00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.880 
Hi everyone! In this video I'm going
to talk about the assignment

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.280 
of the course and give you some
tips. The goal of the assignment

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.670 
is to get you apply what you
learned in this course

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.120 
and make a prototype and
test it with others.

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.940 
In the assignment you will receive
three Idea Profile templates.

6
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.890 
Each template contains one idea,
a description of one idea, and

7
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.210 
who this idea is for. So your
task is to pick one of these

8
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
ideas templates and then build
a prototype for others.

9
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.300 
Now remember that you're supposed
to build a prototype for

10
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.030 
other people. Often when we
receive one idea, we think about

11
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.190 
how can we make this idea
better to fit what we need.

12
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.700 
So here we ask you to stay
with the idea as it is

13
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170 
and prototype and test it.
You will receive several

14
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.110 
templates in this assignment and
we ask you to fill them in

15
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.940 
and upload them to get
feedback from your peers.

16
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.250 
The first template is called
prototype description.

17
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.960 
So after you pick one idea
profile and build a prototype,

18
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.540 
we ask you to fill in this template
and don't forget to also

19
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.720 
take a picture of your
prototype and upload them.

20
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.750 
So you're supposed to describe
the prototype you have built

21
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.610 
but also tell us what
assumption you wish to

22
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.250 
test with this prototype. So
there is one example template

23
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.660 
that you will find in the downloads
as well, so I want to use this

24
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.370 
idea profile example to talk
about the assumption a bit

25
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.260 
more. So this idea is about
an app that connects

26
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.370 
people to peer up and do sports,
so it motivates you by having

27
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.190 
this peer pressure between friends
and once you decide who you

28
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.710 
want to partner up with, it will
send you push notifications.

29
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.140 
So I have designed this very
simple prototype of this app, as

30
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.460 
you can see it's a paper prototype,
I didn't code anything but

31
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.730 
I'm using each page to
basically represent different

32
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.090 
steps in the process,
and what I want to

33
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.300 
test with this app
is to see actually

34
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.210 
if people like the
aspect of peering-up

35
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.740 
with their friends for sports,
so this is my assumption.

36
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.030 
The next step after building a
prototype is to plan for testing.

37
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.260 
We also designed a template
for this and we want to ask

38
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.800 
you to fill in this template
before you go into testing.

39
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.530 
So take a moment to think about
who are you going to test with?

40
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.350 
Is there anyone around you who
has some sort of connection

41
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.700 
with this idea that you have picked?
Going back to the SportsBuddy

42
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.700 
app, I can think of a colleague
of mine who does a lot of

43
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.110 
sports but doesn't
have that much time.

44
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.500 
And I can also think
of a friend who

45
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.220 
goes jogging but she doesn't like
gyms, so she would also be

46
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.640 
a good testing partner. For the
assignment we ask you to test

47
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.910 
with two people, so when you're
collecting the notes and filling

48
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.790 
in the templates make
sure that you use

49
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.310 
a number or hashtag to
show who said which

50
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.300 
part or which quote. In the next
field we ask you to describe

51
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.860 
your testing procedure, for
instance the set-up or the place.

52
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.700 
And also tell us how your tester
will interact with this

53
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.040 
prototype. So, for instance going
back to this app, what I'm

54
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.370 
planning to do is to, first of all,
make my tester feel comfortable

55
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.050 
and basically give them the
prototype and ask them

56
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.590 
to go through different steps
and think out-loud and I'll be

57
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.110 
making notes and taking notes of
what they say, and if there

58
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.180 
is something unclear, I would
ask why and I would ask them

59
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.130 
to voice their opinion, and
I'd also pay attention to

60
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.790 
their body language to see
if everything is clear

61
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.910 
or not. And finally I would ask
some follow-up questions.

62
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.010 
So the next part asks you to
come up with some follow-up

63
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.240 
questions and of course these
questions may change when you

64
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.180 
go through testing, but it's really
good to go already prepared,

65
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.160 
have a couple of open questions
that you're curious

66
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.680 
to learn and this is a great
opportunity to still

67
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.210 
learn a lot about our
potential users.

68
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.570 
The last templates are designed to
help you sort out your feedback

69
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
and also reflect on your
testing. So in order to

70
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.940 
learn more about the tool that we
use watch the 'Feedback Grid'

71
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.520 
video. Also in the 'Iteration'
video we talk about how

72
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.910 
you can go with one key learning
and iterate from there.

73
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.810 
The final step is to reflect on
your testing, so in this course

74
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.430 
we really wanted to encourage
you to learn from things that

75
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.510 
don't work, so if you've got a
critical feedback or negative

76
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.710 
feedback it's not something
to be ashamed of,

77
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.310 
but we want you to look at it
as a very valuable learning,

78
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.740 
something that you can
use to move forward.

79
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.310 
Remember that you are supposed
to give reviews for others

80
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.750 
in order to receive a grade on your
own work. So I want to remind

81
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.860 
you of the course ethics video and
encourage you to write constructive

82
00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.000 
feedback, and for this use the
open box option underneath

83
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.670 
the assignment review part. And
finally, I wanna encourage you

84
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.410 
not to focus too much on
the grade but rather

85
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
the feedback that you will get.
Good luck with the assignment.

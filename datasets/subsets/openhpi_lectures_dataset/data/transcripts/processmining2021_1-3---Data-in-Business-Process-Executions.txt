00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.100 
Welcome to this video clip in
which we take a look at data

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.060 
in business process
executions.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.550 
So process mining is largely based
on data that's being created

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.810 
during business process executions
and we discussed that in

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.590 
the previous video clip
quite extensively.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.790 
To illustrate the main and
fundamental concepts in business

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.620 
on business process management
and also in process mining, for

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.030 
that matter we use a concrete
example that we have created

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.580 
for this online course. And it's the example
of an insurance claim handling process.

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.070 
It's not an example that is, well,
it's a simplified example. So we

11
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.500 
if we look at real world examples
of the process I'm aware that

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.510 
the fact that these examples are
much more complex and these

13
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.670 
process are much more complex. So
it's really a simplified version

14
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.280 
and the main purpose of this
example is to illustrate the main

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.350 
concepts used in
process mining.

16
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.260 
So our insurance claim handling
process has a number of steps,

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.010 
a number of activities that
are being carried out.

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.360 
So first of all we need to receive
certain claims or claims

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.100 
are received. Then there is a
completeness check, so I check

20
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.820 
whether the claim is
complete or not.

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.440 
We need to decide whether we can
cover the claim or whether we

22
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.840 
have to reject the claim and finally
we have to prepare letters

23
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.840 
and we have to send out letters quite
similar to our introductory example.

24
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.250 
In this example we do not have
a blueprint process model. So

25
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.320 
we do not start with a blueprint
process model but we

26
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.290 
implement the process through
organizational policies and rules.

27
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.270 
And this is often really the
case where the process is not

28
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.330 
really specified in a formal
process model but

29
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.750 
the process is implemented through a number
of organizational policies and rules.

30
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.870 
We then need to look for data about the
process execution. And in our scenario

31
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.760 
we have a number of documents and
tables that we can take advantage

32
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.550 
of. So first of all we have a claim
document. So the claim document

33
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.530 
you can think of as a form that
needs to be filled out and

34
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.080 
submitted. So here we have - it's
not readable on purpose - so it

35
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.980 
should just give you
an idea of a form

36
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.720 
to submit a claim.

37
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.090 
We also have information about
completeness checks that are

38
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.490 
being conducted by the insurance
company and we assume that

39
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.160 
these completeness checks are just
represented in a spreadsheet document

40
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.740 
also that's
probably quite typical.

41
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.630 
Finally we have a document
representing the decision on the

42
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.280 
claim coverage. So for each claim
we need to decide whether

43
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.660 
or not we can cover the damage and we
also have information about this

44
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.860 
and we have letters to inform
about acceptance or rejection

45
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.340 
and we have information about the
letters that were being sent

46
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.330 
during the execution of our
insurance claim business process.

47
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.040 
So now let's take a look at the
concrete data and what we do

48
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.740 
with this data. So as indicated in
the previous slide we have a

49
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.590 
number of documents and spreadsheets
that we use as input and

50
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.810 
the first thing we do is we need
to extract information and

51
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.650 
we need to create data tables. So we somehow
unified or unify all the heterogeneous

52
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.560 
data or data in heterogeneous formats.
We need to unify to have this in a

53
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.810 
certain data table. The example that
we have here, so this example

54
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.140 
should be the claim document or
this screenshot should be a

55
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.350 
claim document and we transfer the claim
document to a table called claim table.

56
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.040 
And you can think of all the
information that we have in fields

57
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.480 
in this form, these are now translated
to attributes in a table, a

58
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.340 
spreadsheet table you can think
of it as a spreadsheet table

59
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.070 
or as a relational
table if you wish.

60
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.020 
We also have letters.
So we have a letter

61
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.760 
and a letter goes to the letter table.
So there's a table representing

62
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.640 
information about the
letters that we

63
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.060 
have sent during the
execution of our process.

64
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.840 
I like to stress and I
like to remark and

65
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
also stress that the detailer of details of
this transfer is highly project specific

66
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.170 
and are therefore omitted.
So we understand that

67
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.440 
it incurs considerable effort
in process mining projects to

68
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.060 
extract the data and to have a unified
representation of these data.

69
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.970 
Here in this short online course
we can just sketch the idea

70
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.860 
that yes we have heterogeneous data
sources and yes we need to put them

71
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.800 
into a shared
and common format.

72
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.500 
Right. Now I'd like to walk you
through a number of cases that

73
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.360 
we have observed in our
insurance companies. So first

74
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.130 
of all we have the data about claims and
these are stored in the claims table.

75
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.350 
Alright, so let's look at the
structure of this table. So we

76
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.810 
have a number of attributes. So for
each claim we store a claim ID

77
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.610 
and that's an

78
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.810 
identifying attribute.
You can think of it

79
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.140 
as the primary key of that
table, if you if you are aware

80
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.720 
of this concept from database
theory. Otherwise we would

81
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.440 
just assume that it's a table
that identifies each tuple.

82
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.020 
We also have a client ID. So for
each claim we also store the

83
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.280 
client that has submitted the claim,
we have the theft value. So assume

84
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.710 
these are damages related to a
certain theft. So we have a value

85
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.920 
and we have a received
date and a received time.

86
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.460 
And this timing information is very
important in process mining. Why?

87
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.700 
Because we want to have information
about the ordering of events

88
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.670 
about the ordering of activities being
executed in a business process.

89
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.630 
So business processes consist of
activities that are executed

90
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.010 
in a certain order and in order
to look at the data to find

91
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.430 
out the ordering we have need to
have some timing information

92
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.130 
so that we can really deduce the ordering
of events which is obviously very

93
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.120 
important for the
business process.

94
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.580 
Now let's look at a number of cases
or a number of concrete claims.

95
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.330 
So the first claim that we have here
is the claim 1234,

96
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.130 
claim ID 1234, it's
issued by a client ID by the

97
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.390 
client with the client
id cid272

98
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.940 
the theft value is 890€,

99
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.060 
the received date is April 3rd

100
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.420 
2020 and the received time is
8:05 in the morning.

101
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.010 
So this data we extracted
from that document.

102
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.350 
Then we have here twelve
thirty five and

103
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.430 
there is client id cid 128, 900€,

104
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.740 
it was a bit later, two minutes
later received. So I can assume

105
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.910 
obviously in the morning the data
tells us that in the morning

106
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.470 
we have all these received
operations in place.

107
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.630 
Then we have 1236 and so
forth. And we have 1238

108
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.980 
and we see here that it's obviously
the same customer as the first.

109
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.190 
No, as the second one.
So we again have cid

110
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.230 
218, so we have the
customer with customer ID

111
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.780 
218 we have it here
and we have it here. So

112
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.590 
that's occurring here that is in the data
and just as an information that we have

113
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.370 
not each claim is issued by a
different person but we have

114
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.700 
here 128, this person
has issued two claims and that

115
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.340 
is in the data so we need to deal with
this and we come back to this point

116
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.190 
a little bit later
in this course.

117
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.190 
Alright, so this is the data
that we have for claims.

118
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.050 
Now look at the completeness
checks. I also said that

119
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.680 
we have completeness checks
carried out during the execution

120
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.980 
of this business
process

121
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.700 
and we again have a check
table so here it says check.

122
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.620 
And we again need to

123
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.680 
represent which claim is being
checked for completeness. So

124
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.780 
we need the claim ID,

125
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.390 
we have the employee with a certain
employee that conducts the check,

126
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.140 
we have the result of the check,
it might be yes or no, so it

127
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.430 
might be complete or it
might not be complete.

128
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.670 
Actually in two cases it's
incomplete in the other case

129
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.480 
is complete.

130
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.660 
And we also have the check date
and we also have the check time.

131
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.670 
Right, so that's the structure
of this check table

132
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.760 
and let's look at the first
tuples - we have here

133
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.710 
claim ID the claim with the
claim ID 1239,

134
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.480 
checked by employee 182,
yes it is complete and the

135
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.860 
check date is a few days later
is on the sixth of April

136
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.760 
2020 at 08:23.

137
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:51.300 
And the second one 1234 is also a bit

138
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.480 
at the same time it's a different
employee so they were conducting

139
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.470 
these activities obviously at the
same time and that's also perfectly

140
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.450 
legal. We have the case 1236
and this case is incomplete.

141
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.460 
Here we say no. It's no.
So it's incomplete

142
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.470 
and we also have the case or the
claim with claim ID 1240

143
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.690 
and it also is incomplete.
So these two 1236

144
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.800 
and t1240 are incomplete.
And we will also come back to these

145
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.420 
aspects a little
bit later.

146
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.770 
We also need to
represent decisions

147
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.660 
in data tables and here we have
the respective decision table.

148
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.190 
So again we have the claim
ID for the decision,

149
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.180 
we have the ID of the claim that
is decided upon the decision

150
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.410 
can be yes or no. So either yes
I can accept the claim and I

151
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.210 
will cover the
damage or not.

152
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.010 
We have a number of employees
here, we have a decision date.

153
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.570 
So that's more or less

154
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.610 
ten days after it came into the
organization and we have a decision time.

155
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.230 
And you see here that you have some
ordering here between these and we

156
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.900 
have we can see in this table but
we can also see in the previous

157
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.540 
table that the ordering is
a little bit different.

158
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.350 
So the order in which the claims
were received is not the same

159
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.160 
as the order in which the
decisions have been taken

160
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.980 
but this is what the
data tells us and

161
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.070 
this information needs to be taken
into account also a bit later.

162
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.110 
So finally we come to data stored
or to the letters. So we also

163
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.770 
need to store information
related to letters

164
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.380 
in a data table

165
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.630 
and here we have first of all
the letter has an ID. So each

166
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.650 
letter has an ID and each letter
is related to a claim and

167
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.430 
that's, I mean, the letter ID helps
us to identify certain letters

168
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.370 
for one claim ID I might be
able to send several letters,

169
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.160 
not in our example but in general.
Therefore we introduce this

170
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.440 
letter ID here as well.

171
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.380 
The letter ID or the letter
takes also decision. So the

172
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.220 
decision needs to be
represented here.

173
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.050 
Then we have two timestamps. So
we have the timestamp of the

174
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.220 
preparation of the letter. So
prepare date and prepare time.

175
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.810 
That's the point
in time when the

176
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.230 
letter was written or prepared
or the writing of the letter

177
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.490 
has been completed to be a bit
more precise. So we really have

178
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.690 
to look at where this data
actually comes from. So our

179
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.360 
assumption here is that is the time when
the letter was finished basically.

180
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.930 
The employee who has written or
prepared the letter and then

181
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.220 
we have a send date, so one day
later one day after preparing

182
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.260 
the letter the letter is sent and
that's also a process activity

183
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.980 
and it's also
important since this

184
00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:03.690 
sending event or the sending of the
letter marks the termination of this

185
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.550 
process.

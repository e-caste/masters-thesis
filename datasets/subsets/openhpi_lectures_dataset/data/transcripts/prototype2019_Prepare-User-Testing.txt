00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.700 
In this video we talk
about how to prepare for

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.610 
and plan your user testing. So
we will talk about who to test

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.530 
with, where to meet them and also
how to make them comfortable to

4
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.450 
gain valuable feedback.

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.370 
First think about who you want to test with. For
the start, it's easy to test with family, friends

6
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.290 
or colleagues. But in a real project it
may take some time to recruit people

7
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.350 
and find someone suitable
for your topic.

8
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.000 
Testing with people you don't
know can be very helpful,

9
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.920 
because strangers have a
different perspectives on your

10
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300 
topic and they won't try to please
you with their feedback like

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.770 
relatives sometimes do. It helps
especially to improve your

12
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.180 
moderation skills and also
to push your comfort zone.

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.990 
Overall it's very important that
you pick people for testing

14
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.720 
who are related to the topic or
who could be potential users.

15
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.890 
Think about your potential user
group, where could you meet

16
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.560 
them? Where do they spend most of
their time so you could reach out

17
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
to them? Or where could you approach
them in a relaxed environment?

18
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.990 
Also think about the surrounding
that you're going to test

19
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.900 
in. Should it be in a lab?
Could it be on the streets or

20
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.940 
can you do it in the office? Pick
something that is connected

21
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.990 
to your topic. For example if
you want to set up a space

22
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.850 
prototype, you also need to think
about where you could do this.

23
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.530 
It might be helpful to do this in
a frequently visited location.

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.480 
And if you for example have
students you want to test with

25
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.720 
you could go to university canteens
or university libraries.

26
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.280 
Before you start your user testing
it's good to think through

27
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.630 
the whole procedure once. How do
you want to start, run, and end

28
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.450 
your testing? What do you
need to prepare beforehand?

29
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.860 
What do you want to take with you?
How do you want to take notes?

30
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.400 
And what kind of follow-up
questions do you want to ask?

31
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.570 
Like we mentioned before, pick a
location that you feel comfortable

32
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.740 
in and that your tester
feels comfortable in.

33
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.340 
This could be a place that
your tester is familiar with

34
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.800 
or it could be a place that helps
your tester imagine the prototype

35
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.130 
in its real setting. Think about how
you want to introduce yourself

36
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.510 
and the topic. You can also tell
you tester why you chose them

37
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.550 
specifically to test your prototype
and what will happen to

38
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.650 
the information you gather. You
should emphasise that there

39
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.630 
are no right or wrong comments and
that you're truly interested

40
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.890 
in the opinion of your tester
about the prototype.

41
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.340 
So after introducing it
and giving some context

42
00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.390 
you will start by giving the
prototype to the tester

43
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.770 
and let them experience it. You
will learn most by observing

44
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.460 
and listening to them carefully.
It helps to have some questions

45
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.670 
prepared already so you can
follow their train of thoughts.

46
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.900 
And especially if your tester
is new to this whole

47
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.490 
situation or is a bit
shy to think out loud

48
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.730 
these questions will help. So for
example you could ask 'what

49
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.410 
are you thinking right now?'
Or 'why did you do this?'

50
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.760 
You definitely have to have some
follow up questions prepared

51
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.700 
that you can ask once the tester
experienced all features of

52
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.240 
your prototype. This
could be things like

53
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.470 
'what do you think the
prototype is and does

54
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.380 
in your own words?' Or 'where do
you see the prototype in your

55
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.300 
daily life?' At the end you should
definitely leave some space

56
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.460 
where you ask about open comments
or some questions that they

57
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.680 
have left. - After the testing is
over, you should thank the tester

58
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.050 
for their time and also the feedback.
Especially also the critical

59
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.860 
feedback because this is
very valuable to us too.

60
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.250 
Remember the tips from our testing
demo videos and always stay

61
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.390 
open to divert from your planned
procedure for the testing.

62
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.920 
So we hope this video gives you
an idea of how to plan for

63
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.580 
your testing.

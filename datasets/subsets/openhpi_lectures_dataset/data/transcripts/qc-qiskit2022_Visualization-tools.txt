00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.640 
welcome back in this video you will learn about the visualization tools

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.270 
visualization tools that you have available in Qiskit in order to plot

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.130 
to plot the data of your experiments

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.170 
so let's go back to the Quantum Lab

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500 
for this video we will be using the visualization tools file

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.300 
let me make this bar

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.390 
so when you're working on a tutorial on a paper or maybe just

8
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.460 
for clarification for yourself it's always important to have some

9
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.720 
way of visualizing what you're doing so this is why

10
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.610 
Qiskit has a full module

11
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.080 
that is dedicated for visualization and this is

12
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.870 
qiskit.visualization module

13
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.690 
so let's first import everything we're going to use and let's get started

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.990 
one of the main tools you have already seen it in other videos

15
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.300 
is the histogram but now we're going to have a look

16
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.180 
a more detailed look into it

17
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.220 
we're going to create first the circuit that we have been working with

18
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.160 
as an example which is the one where we apply a Hadamard gate

19
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.090 
to the first qubit and a CNOT gate to the second one

20
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.390 
and we're going to separately create

21
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.770 
another quantum circuit that only contains two qubits initialized

22
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.920 
to zero and then the measurement operation

23
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.030 
so with that what we're going to do is select as the backend the qasm_simulator

24
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.510 
and we're going to compose both circuits that we just created into

25
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.650 
a single circuit called circ

26
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.550 
then we're going to execute, we're going to run our circuit transpiling it first

27
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.480 
it first you'll see what that means in the last video of this week

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.040 
and we will say how many shots we want this experiment to be repeated

29
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.570 
we store the result in a dictionary

30
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.810 
a dictionary that contains

31
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.270 
the class so a state in this case and the number of times

32
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.160 
we observed that state

33
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.890 
and that we have to give as input to our histogram

34
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.500 
so what different things can we change in our histogram

35
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.300 
and what can we customize

36
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.510 
we can add a legend, we can change the size, we can even represent different

37
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.780 
multiple results in the same histogram so in this case

38
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.920 
this is an example of we're running a second

39
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.970 
execution of the same experiment and we are plotting

40
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.810 
both of them in the same histogram

41
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.940 
of course you can also customize colours

42
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.490 
and there is also the possibility to

43
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.150 
use different outputs in a plot_histogram() so we can change

44
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.590 
the object that it returns

45
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.940 
here you can choose the one that is more convenient for you

46
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.300 
another important thing that

47
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.300 
you might want to visualize is the vector state

48
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.830 
so that is why we have different visualization tools for that

49
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.530 
we have the 'plot_state_city' and that is

50
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.450 
the standard view of quantum states and we

51
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.380 
plot separately the real and imaginary part of the state matrix

52
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.450 
and it's called city because it looks like a city

53
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.430 
then the traditional 'qsphere' that you have already seen in some other videos

54
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.940 
the representation you see in Pauli operations as the bases

55
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.380 
then the 'hinton' representation that is the same as the 'city'

56
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.720 
but the size of the element represents the value of the matrix element

57
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.130 
a finally a multi qubit version of the bloch sphere which means

58
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.960 
basically that we represent each of the qubits in our bloch sphere

59
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.270 
so let's import all of these tools and create an experiment

60
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.580 
where previews bell a circuit in which we don't have measurements yet

61
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.790 
because otherwise we will not be

62
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.580 
plotting the result before measuring

63
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.250 
but the probability distribution once it's already measured

64
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.040 
so since we also want to upload the imaginary part with them measure

65
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.660 
so this is how the 'city' tool would like

66
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.480 
for the same

67
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.810 
state the 'hinton' one, the 'qsphere',

68
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.290 
the 'paulivec',

69
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.680 
and the 'bloch_multivector'

70
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.760 
ok of course here again we can also customize

71
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.100 
different things such as the size, of course the titles so

72
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.860 
a couple of examples

73
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.990 
and last but not least

74
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.300 
it's also always very important to be able also for educational purposes but

75
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.440 
sometimes when we only have a single qubit or we have

76
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.170 
the state of a concrete qubit it and we want to represent it with

77
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.710 
the bloch sphere we can give directly the 'bloch_vector'

78
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.800 
and plot it in our bloch sphere as you can see here

79
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.860 
some customizations

80
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.300 
that's it for the Qiskit visualization model

81
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.390 
so now you hopefully know how to make your tutorials

82
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.050 
or papers a more visually appealing and in the next couple

83
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.150 
of videos we will learn how to use the simulators module and

84
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.820 
how to execute

85
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.350 
experiments in real hardware

86
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.360 
thank you so much i'm looking forward to seeing you in the next videos

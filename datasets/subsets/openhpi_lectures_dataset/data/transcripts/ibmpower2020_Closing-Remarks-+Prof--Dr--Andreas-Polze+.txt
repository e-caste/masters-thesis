00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280 
Congratulations on mastering the biggest
part of the Future in Computing -

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.300 
on the road to
Quantum Computing

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.410 
course. We want to now talk a
little bit about the next steps

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.150 
and how to continue
from here

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.810 
If you remember in the introduction
we mentioned the Future SOC Lab

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.010 
which is a link to our
institute if you want to run

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.040 
projects here, if you want to
connect with people at the

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.670 
institute. And turns out that
the four heads you see here,

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.470 
the four people on the screen - two
of them are actively administering

10
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.060 
Future SOC Lab projects. So
these guys will be able

11
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.000 
to help you further

12
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.160 
And even if you don't consider projects
in the Future SOC Lab but just want to

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.370 
look at additional courses,
then you are invited to look

14
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.060 
at "openhpi.de". And here we see a
number of courses that have been run,

15
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.290 
some of them are in English, many of them
are in German. It's about many fields in

16
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.910 
computer architecture in IT but also
in application domains and also

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.340 
about fundamental properties of
systems like the cyber security

18
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.790 
and you not only can attend these
courses but you also can earn

19
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.040 
credits (ECTS)
by the way.

20
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.160 
And then I want to
use a few words of

21
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.530 
acknowledgments and gratitude. So we
are very grateful for the people

22
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.150 
at IBM who helped us building this course,
in particular, there is Hildegard

23
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.500 
Gerhardy, who was
all the time

24
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.010 
getting the right speakers, being
supportive, connected inside

25
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.990 
IBM and beyond. There is
Dr. Wolfgang Maier,

26
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.760 
he is the head of the hardware
research in the Böblingen Lab

27
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.050 
and Sven Peyer, who has been
working closely with us

28
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.810 
in designing the course and getting
all the speakers on board.

29
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.550 
And of course, I also want
to say thank you to

30
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
the people in my group, in
particular, Felix Eberhardt

31
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.250 
and Max Plauth, who are
senior PhD students,

32
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.480 
to Sven Köhler, Lukas Wenzel, Robert Schmid,
who followed them in the footsteps and

33
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.320 
they are all working in the field
of computer architecture.

34
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.350 
The course would not have
been possible without

35
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.170 
the support of
these people.

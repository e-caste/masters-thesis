00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.580 
Welcome to our online course "A Half
Century of Internet: How it Works Today".

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.140 
The internet. The internet global
communication infrastructure that

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.860 
is changing our world. Here is a
short image which shows that

4
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.930 
all the world is connected via the
internet and the number of users

5
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.530 
of seeing the net is almost half
of the world's population.

6
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.460 
Half of the world's population is
online with different devices

7
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.220 
most in most cases are such mobile
devices but also with computers

8
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.540 
and others and it's increasing
and more and more increasing.

9
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.420 
In the western states almost everyone is
online. Here is an example from Germany -

10
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.450 
this is a total number of
population which is online

11
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.540 
and the number of percentage of
the population it is counted

12
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.660 
from people from sixteen years to
the end of life. So internet

13
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.950 
is a basic infrastructure of
our world and what we want

14
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.180 
to do in this course is to help
to understand how internet

15
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.130 
is working, what's the technique
behind. Everyone is welcome who wants

16
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.500 
to know better about the internet
- how it works and what it means

17
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
for our everyday life.

18
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.200 
There are no participation
requirements needed.

19
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.880 
Everyone is welcome. The course includes
a huge number of short learning videos.

20
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.260 
There are for each learning video an
interactive quiz and tasks for self testing.

21
00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.280 
There is a discussion forum
which enables you to interact

22
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.680 
with other learners, to discuss with
another learners various topics

23
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.820 
and a number of
related materials.

24
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.280 
At the end of the course you can get
various achievement certificates,

25
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.010 
for example a confirmation of
participation in the course,

26
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.540 
you can get a record of achievement,
you can get a qualified certificate.

27
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.030 
Record of achievement means is
that from all the homework from

28
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.400 
as a final exam you manage to get at least
half of the points that are available

29
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.520 
and in a qualified certificate
means that when you make

30
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.380 
homework when you do the final
exam you will be observed and

31
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.490 
then you get a certificate.
Even with credit points.

32
00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.580 
So the course like all our openhpi
courses provides materials

33
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.320 
teaching materials, video, self tests,
course forum and we encourage you

34
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.860 
to study this teaching
materials which we offer, we

35
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.440 
encourage you to control
your learning progress.

36
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.300 
You can do this with the help
of supervised tests and we

37
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.830 
also invite you to actively
participate in our discussion form.

38
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.920 
Discussion forum helps to exchange
the learning material to have

39
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.760 
an exchange about the
learning activity

40
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.070 
material with other learners, to discuss
some questions in more details,

41
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.770 
to ask questions and others and
we also provide on our platform

42
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.490 
and individual collab space for
collaboration. So you can also open

43
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.560 
learning room to discuss with a limited
group of people about certain

44
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.310 
topics. What is the course about
though? Here is a content

45
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.130 
of the different weeks the course
runs over six weeks and each week

46
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.550 
provides material to one topic.
So in week one which starts on

47
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.000 
September first we speak about
digitalisation of the world.

48
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.600 
In which ways internet has changed
our world, history of internet

49
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.990 
and digitalisation, we discuss the different
aspects of digital transformation.

50
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.520 
In the second week we will discuss
about the technical basis.

51
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.590 
We will start to discuss about
technical basis and we will

52
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.230 
look to computer networks. What is a computer
network, how the data are transferred

53
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.760 
in such a computer network, which
network technologies are in used.

54
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.940 
Then in the third and in the fourth
week we speak about the internet

55
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.450 
the network of networks and
discuss the technique behind.

56
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
How do I connect to the internet, how
does data find their way through

57
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.320 
the internet? The internet is a
interconnection of different networks.

58
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.690 
So the question is what happens
on the border between one

59
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.840 
network and another network, how data
are transferred over such borders,

60
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.830 
which resources and systems are necessary
to let the internet work as it work

61
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.760 
and what are the internet
protocols and how do they work?

62
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.800 
Then in the fifth week, it starts
on september twenty nine,

63
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.110 
we will look on various
internet applications.

64
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.300 
How do such internet application
work in general, how do email

65
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.630 
work, how do world wide web work, which
technologies are used for social media,

66
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.880 
what is behind Netflix &amp; Co. and
how does online banking work?

67
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.510 
Speaking about such application
we see that also necessary

68
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.550 
to speak about web security and
this is a topic of the sixth week

69
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.940 
of our openhpi course about
internet technology.

70
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.880 
It starts on october six and is
about internet and web security,

71
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.350 
what dangers exist in the internet,
how can they be identified,

72
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.970 
who or what are so called hackers,
why is data so important, why

73
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.860 
data protection is so important
and how we can protect data

74
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.650 
and identities in the internet.
This is the content of our

75
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.720 
openhpi course. Here are some more
information - course start September first,

76
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.730 
course end October twentieth, the
final exam is in the week between

77
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.840 
October thirteenth to nineteenth, so
after the six week of learning.

78
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:26.580 
And what you have to calculate,
what you calculate

79
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.290 
the time you have to calculate to take
part in the course. So you should study

80
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:38.090 
the provided learning materials,
look to the video clips,

81
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.850 
deal with the quizzes and do
the homework. So what we

82
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.920 
the estimate is that you need about
three to six hours a week for

83
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:56.860 
dealing with the material and
learning about what we want to

84
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.470 
teach you. And then the weekly
homework. There you have a time

85
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.900 
span from sixty
minutes to do this.

86
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.540 
This is the teaching team. My name is
Christopher Meinel, I'm director

87
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.840 
of the Hasso Plattner Institute
in Potsdam, I am dean

88
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.640 
of the digital engineering faculty
of the University of Potsdam

89
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.230 
and I have a chair about internet
technologies and systems.

90
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:34.510 
In our chair we focus in the research
work about security engineering,

91
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.380 
about learning and knowledge
engineering, digital education

92
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.500 
is a very important part. So for
example the platform openhpi platform

93
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.790 
which is used also by partners
was developed on my chair

94
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.830 
and we also do with design thinking
some innovation research.

95
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.320 
And I get support. I get support
from my scientific co-workers

96
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:07.390 
from Raad Bin Tareaf, he is doing
research work and PhD thesis

97
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.570 
in social media analytics.
Christian Bartz, he supports me

98
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.440 
his research topic is neural networks,
deep learning, AI, computer vision.

99
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:24.790 
I am supported by GonÃ§alo
Mordido, he is also doing

100
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.650 
research work and a PhD
work in deep learning,

101
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:33.260 
in a generative models and Monte
Carlo models. Chris Pelchen

102
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.700 
is a member of the teaching
team. His research is focused

103
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:44.700 
on security engineering and digital
identities and then we have Muhammad

104
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.060 
Ihsan Haikal Sukmana. He is also
in the security team, his

105
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.320 
phd work is concentrated on security
engineering and cloud computing.

106
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.410 
So this is our team. We will
support you. In this course we

107
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.230 
will provide the material, we will
take part in the discussions

108
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:15.010 
but we hope that you become very active
because in such an active learner community

109
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:21.950 
learning makes fun and learning
has an effect. So very

110
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:28.120 
welcome. We are looking forward to you in our
online course "A Half Century of Internet:

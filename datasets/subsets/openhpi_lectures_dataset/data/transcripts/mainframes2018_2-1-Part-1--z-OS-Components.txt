1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.239 
Yeah, hello, it's me again, Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy,

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.099 
and in the next video clip, I want to talk about

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.629 
z/OS components. z/OS is the main operating system running

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.219 
on IBM mainframes and with this

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.959 
clip, I want to talk about the components that are the most important

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.429 
components, I don't talk about all of them, just the most important components

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.909 
that are running in a z/OS environment.

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.379 
And when we talk about these components, there are two components where

9
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.039 
we talk a little later in more detail.

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.899 
These two components have a direct interface to the users and these interfaces

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.690 
on the one side, the top management we see Job Entry Subsystem.

12
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.579 
Job Entry Subsystem is the component that is necessary

13
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.989 
for running batch jobs for running so-called starter tasks.

14
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.518 
I think Professor Brune already mentioned them, what are starter tasks,

15
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.769 
and also z/OS users get in contact with JES without

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.689 
having to know that. But other people who

17
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.279 
want to submit so-called batch jobs, they need, in any

18
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.029 
case, the interface to the Job Entry Subsystem.

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.679 
We have another component that has a direct interface to the

20
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.599 
users. This is the Data management and the IO supervisor.

21
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.620 
This is where the data is managed to and

22
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.009 
you have managed on the datasets and the datasets

23
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.071 
reside on DASD.

24
00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:51.749 
DASD is the abbreviation, for Direct Access Storage

25
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.339 
Device. In other environments, we just talk about disks, and also

26
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.649 
in the mainframe environment, sometimes we talk about disks.

27
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.930 
And now we have a set of components, these screened components,

28
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.929 
the so-called supervisor and the supervisor can be seen as something

29
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.499 
like a kernel in our operating system.

30
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.719 
It's a base of 'z' operating system and we don't go into

31
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.279 
more detail just to mention them here, we have an interrupt handler, as

32
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.559 
the name states, it handles interrupts and interrupts are really important.

33
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.239 
All stuff that is coming into an mainframe operating

34
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.639 
system comes via interrupts.

35
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.177 
We can say that the IBM 'z' mainframe is a

36
00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:47.519 
100 percent interrupt-controlledenvironment.

37
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.589 
So all the work that comes into the

38
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.059 
system and also works that ends within the system, all are controlled

39
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.129 
by interrupts.

40
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.869 
In the middle of the management of such an environment are the so-called

41
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.870 
Address Spaces.

42
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.689 
Professor Brune already mentioned them in the last video clip.

43
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.919 
Address Spaces, there are different kinds of address spaces, one of the more important

44
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.729 
address spaces as examples are the so-called Starter Tasks.

45
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.499 
In other operating system environments, you will talk about

46
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.949 
daemons. So a daemon is very

47
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.409 
well compatible with starter tasks and in general the address spaces.

48
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.119 
Again, there is a nice comparison, if you compare it with other

49
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.779 
operating systems, you would talk about processes.

50
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.429 
So a process on a Unix or Linux system for example

51
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.169 
is comparable to an address space and the address spaces have to be

52
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.729 
managed and the interface and the components that manages

53
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.169 
these address spaces is a so-called dispatch off and on

54
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.939 
the right side with these green rectangles, we

55
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.789 
have program management, how programs are managed.

56
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.559 
We have task management, task can be compared to other

57
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.699 
system environments like threads.

58
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.119 
A task is like a thread. So when we talk about multitasking in a

59
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.829 
mainstream environment, it's the same as if you talk about multithreading

60
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.859 
in a Unix or Linux environment.

61
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.659 
And then we have the storage management and just to emphasize,

62
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.799 
it has nothing to do with the disk management.

63
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.882 
It's really the storage management within the

64
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.319 
system and we have three subcomponents, it's

65
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.869 
RSM, VSM, and the ASM. This is the Real Storage Manager (RSM) controlling

66
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.400 
the real storage. It's Virtual Storage Manager

67
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.099 
managing your virtual storage, and the Auxillary Storage Manager (ASM)

68
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.389 
is the paging manager.

69
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.429 
The last components are System Resource Manager and the Workload Manager.

70
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.869 
These are really important subcomponents, the system

71
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.729 
resource manager as the name states, controls system resources

72
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.259 
and in very, very former days, it was the only component

73
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.899 
to control such an environment.

74
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.089 
Though in former days, we had a focus on resource management.

75
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.529 
In between, we got the workloadmanager, workload manager is an

76
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.659 
extension of these control management things

77
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.789 
and the workload manager, as although the name states, controls some workloads

78
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.739 
and it's really important because on our IBM mainframe,

79
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.299 
normally they are running very different workloads, they are

80
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.129 
running batch workloads, time-sharing, online workloads, databases,

81
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.719 
transactions and so on. These are workloads and the workload manager

82
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.153 
controls these workloads and in between, we talk about the so-called Goal

83
00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:11.989 
Mode. It means that we set the goals for each and every one of our

84
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.129 
workloads and the workload manager tries to keep this goal

85
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.649 
exactly as they are set, and they can do it normally really,

86
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.119 
really very efficiently. So it's not uncommon in a mainframe environment that

87
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.679 
we have for a longer interval, let's say, one or

88
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.069 
two hours, 100 percent CPU utilization.

89
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.119 
It's normally no problem at all because these different workloads have different

90
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.979 
priorities and the workload manager controls who gets control of the

91
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.980 
resources.

92
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.149 
This was a very brief overview of

93
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.829 
the z/OS components and this was this video clip for

94
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.859 
these components. If you have any questions, remarks, and so on.

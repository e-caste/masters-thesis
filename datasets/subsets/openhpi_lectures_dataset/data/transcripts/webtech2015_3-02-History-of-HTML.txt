1
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.190 
Now let's have a short look to the history of HTML.

2
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.970 
From the very beginning HTML was a part, was a central component

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.540 
of the first world Wide Web concept, which was introduced in 1989

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
1990 by Robert Cailliau and Tim Berners Lee- at the European

5
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.180 
Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN.

6
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.090 
The first HTML version offered,

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810 
this was the centeral part- the hyperlink concept.

8
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.700 
Hyperlink but only in a rudimentary document description

9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.930 
were possible. The headings in various hierarchy levels paragraph definition was

10
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.010 
in place and different

11
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.350 
definitions of list, and if one asked why exactly these parts are

12
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.900 
regulated in the HTML language, then the reason was this was exactly

13
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.150 
the need in this sum in the European Organization for Nuclear Research

14
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.490 
to communicate experimental results between

15
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.680 
the positions in the world.

16
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.920 
Then HTML 2.0 was adopted in 1994,

17
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.790 
and it went through multiple enhancements

18
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.190 
for proprietary browsers. So for the Arena, for the Mosaic browser and

19
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.380 
an important thing was that the HTML 2.0 was the first

20
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.390 
html version which had its own SGML Document Type Definition.

21
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
So this was designed in a touristic way.

22
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.990 
When we speak about that time 1994

23
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.300 
there was the World Wide Web Consortium

24
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.590 
founded. And it was founded as an organization committee and

25
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.410 
the advocacy group for developing the World Wide Web.

26
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.980 
And of course important part of this development was to give possibilities,

27
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.350 
to define web documents.

28
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.350 
So the first recommendation which was given by the

29
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.350 
World Wide Web Consortium was an HTML 3.0 version but

30
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.010 
this was a theoretical language version.

31
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.540 
Important was whether one can use it in practice, and the question

32
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
whether one can use a markup language in practice was the question.

33
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.820 
How much the browsers

34
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.940 
recognize the different elements of the HTML document, how the interpreters, the HTML

35
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.080 
interpreters were in place. And in that time in the early nineteen's,

36
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.460 
there was a very strong competition between the different browser manufacturers.

37
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.460 
Now we speak of the "browser war".

38
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.220 
And the idea the manufacturers had in that time was to come

39
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.170 
with very special own language elements.

40
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.870 
Their browsers are

41
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.700 
on the basis of which the browser were able

42
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.090 
to show nice features, to display documents in a particular nice way.

43
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.010 
But the other browser manufacturers did not recognize this at all.

44
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.060 
So the documents designed

45
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.140 
only could be displayed on one

46
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.540 
or two browsers, and not on the others.

47
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.490 
This was really a problem because the browser manufacturers did not recognize

48
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.210 
the standard that was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium.

49
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.620 
They tried to compete to each other by coming up with proprietary elements

50
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.800 
with idea to bind users on their browser.

51
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.960 
And in the end, was a complete incompatibility of the different

52
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.670 
versions of a document. On one browser looks very different

53
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.200 
from another browser.

54
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.170 
In 1997,

55
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.850 
people stepped back and realized that HTML 2.0

56
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:49.110 
was the only standard that were considered by all the browser manufacturers.

57
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.030 
So all the web browsers what was defined and what's possible

58
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.830 
to describe this 2.0 was displayed in the same way.

59
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.320 
But all the new features defined in HTML 3.0

60
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.430 
or which are defined by the different browser manufacturers

61
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.820 
they were not common sense.

62
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.750 
So people step back and say let's have a look what all the browsers

63
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.400 
use in common. To this, HTML 2.0 elements belong to it, and

64
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.770 
then some of the particularly successful

65
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.430 
browser proprietary elements.

66
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.530 
So HTML 3.2 was the

67
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.370 
least common divider, concludes many new features of the individual browser manufacturers.

68
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.810 
So for example tables or integration of Java Applets,

69
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.310 
text flow around images

70
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.130 
and it was the lowest common denominator with respect to the simultaneous

71
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.610 
expansion of HTML 2.0.

72
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.680 
On the other side, in that time also the browser manufacturers learned that it

73
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.070 
does not make sense to follow this development path to create very particular

74
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.320 
language elements, which are not a part of the other browsers.

75
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.830 
They learned that competition was not to bind the users to a browser

76
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:32.580 
on special elements. They realized that it makes sense to guarantee that the document

77
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
could also be displayed on that browser, in that browser, and

78
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.120 
they compete in the way

79
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.870 
of some switches or some as the usability of the browsers how

80
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.230 
speed and other things.

81
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.090 
Then the first proposal

82
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.580 
of HTML 4.0

83
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.060 
already came, although in that time in the end of 1997.

84
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:05.360 
The most important invention of HTML 4.0 was the strict

85
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.970 
division between that HTML is responsible for defining structure of a document

86
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.830 
and that there is a format language,

87
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.830 
cascading stylesheets were introduced which are responsible for

88
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.700 
the layout of the different structural elements.

89
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.670 
So HTML beside of HTML 4.0, the cascading stylesheets were introduced

90
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.820 
and the designers of web pages are

91
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.420 
asked to strictly separate structure definition and layout

92
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.730 
definition of a document using HTML 4.0 for the structure definition

93
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:51.050 
and cascading stylesheets for the appearance and formatting of the document.

94
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:59.440 
So using cascading stylesheets made many parts of older HTML

95
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.110 
versions unnecessary. I already mentioned in the early html versions.

96
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.670 
HTML also described some formatting

97
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.780 
elements. Now this could be replaced by CSS

98
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.120 
and in HTML 4.0 such old unnecessary

99
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.020 
elements for defining the layout, they are called,

100
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.610 
which are obsolete now, are called "deprecated"

101
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.270 
elements. HTML 4.0 further supports frames. Frames for

102
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:41.030 
improved implantation of tables and of multimedia objects, and forms.

103
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:48.630 
Then next step in the history was the development of XHTML,

104
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:58.050 
and XHTML this was simply a reformulation of HTML 4.01

105
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:07.180 
by means of XML. So it was described as an XML

106
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.880 
Document Type Definition.

107
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.800 
So HTML had for that reason to be adapted to the constraints of

108
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.590 
XML. XML as extended markup language, we

109
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:27.370 
have a closer look to it. And for example in this XML, it was

110
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.590 
mandatory to conclude every start tag with an end tag. And you

111
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.920 
remember that in HTML, this was not possible,

112
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.700 
not necessary as long as interpretation

113
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.440 
was possible of the document.

114
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.540 
The limitation of XHTML to the language elements in the Document Type Definition

115
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.410 
is Strict Document Type Definition. This was standardized by the

116
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.170 
World Wide Web Consortium as

117
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.270 
XHTML 1.1.

118
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.780 
Then work start in 2002

119
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.890 
on continued development of XHTML 2.0.

120
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.010 
Besides of this development,

121
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.130 
there was another development. In 2004, there was a

122
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:29.670 
WHAT Working Group- established the Web Hypertext Application

123
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.320 
Technology Working Group. And the members include for example

124
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.980 
Mozilla Foundation, Opera Software many of the browser

125
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.050 
vendors, and a director of this group was Ian

126
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.460 
Hickson, the author of ACID test. Later on I show you such an ACID test.

127
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.990 
The WHAT Work Group, they were working on the draft for Web

128
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.590 
Application 1.0.

129
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.560 
Later this result was called HTML 5.

130
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.190 
And this HTML 5 was a different approach to enlarge supposabilities

131
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.390 
to describe the structure of web documents,

132
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.480 
and it was an alternative to the XHTML 2.0 development.

133
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.230 
Then in 2006 Tim Berners-Lee published

134
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:33.280 
his famous paper 'Reinventing HTML'. This was a policy development paper

135
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.670 
on the principles of HTML 5.

136
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.220 
Then in 2009, the two different development were

137
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.270 
give up. So the development and the work on the a XHTML 2.0

138
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.680 
were closed and the people

139
00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:02.370 
step over to the WHAT Working Group to contribute to the definition of HTML 5.0.

140
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.360 
So the World Wide Web Consortium and WHAT working group was together,

141
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.010 
work together on the HTML 5, and

142
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.870 
XHTML 5. And then it needs a buyer in May 2011.

143
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.580 
The html 5 receives the status of last call from the

144
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.670 
world wide web consortium and this status means that the standard

145
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.280 
development of the standard were always finished, and people could

146
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.360 
have last remarks for improvement of the standard.

147
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:50.420 
So HTML 5 was then completed in October 2014. So

148
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:57.590 
quite recently. And interesting part now is how the browser support this

149
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:06.780 
elements of the new html version. So in the moment people already work on

150
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.250 
the improvement of HTML 5. They work in the

151
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:17.010 
world wide web consortium on the html version

152
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.980 
5.1.

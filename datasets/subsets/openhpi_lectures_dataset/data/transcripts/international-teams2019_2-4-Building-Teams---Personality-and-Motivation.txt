1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.300 
So, Salim you mentioned earlier the
importance of the personality

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.820 
of the worker, once it comes
to remote work you also

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.830 
mentioned motivation, how it's
also important from the company

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.860 
sides but also, how we as a remote
worker motivating ourselves.

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.490 
Could you please elaborate more?
Yes, personality and motivation

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.980 
as you say before we talk about
the personality there is some

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.660 
self-motivation, self-discipline,
and flexibility. All those are

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
definitely elements that
are relevant for working

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.160 
remotely, that you can work
at you at your own peace

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.660 
that you have some motivation
to do. I'm doing this

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.410 
the job here and I appreciate it
because I'm doing this job here

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.820 
and then, you are enthusiastic
in what you are doing

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.830 
this is definitely
something relevant. This

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.080 
is also related to your personality,
what you want to achieve.

15
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.480 
Also, your work lifestyle, that
it matches to all of this.

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.940 
In the socialization, we already
talk about the socialization may

17
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.560 
bring also a problem. If we are
not interacting constantly

18
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.990 
personally, face to face but
there are some channels we

19
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.130 
can use for this interaction and right
now. What problems would bring?

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.560 
Problems that they... our
expressions, our getting closer

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
is not as good as if we are working
remotely, and then they...

22
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.580 
when you express something, you
also try transmitting emotions,

23
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.140 
and probably we are discussing
a project, and you start

24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.820 
making...you know what... the project,
we just with this expressions

25
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.350 
with this mimics all the stuff, you
start giving more information

26
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.830 
than normal, and if this is
missing, this communication is

27
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.350 
missing, some knowledge is also
gone and this is sometimes a

28
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.330 
risk. Therefore, the socialization
plays also a very very big

29
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.530 
role in this, in our teams. Also
is very important when we

30
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.290 
are talking about people outside
working remotely, and we think

31
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.070 
about the manager saying ok, you
need to do this this this and

32
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.920 
the tasks that are defined at
completely unrealistic, because

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.160 
I expect someone to do one task
in two days but normally it

34
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160 
takes five days, what happened?
People, probably are

35
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.790 
working remotely, and they are enjoying
that they are not traveling,

36
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.910 
and all of these are good, but
if people are not overloaded

37
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.540 
in what they need to achieve then
you will have another problem.

38
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.280 
You will have stress,
you have people sick,

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.300 
you have people having other
problems, and we also

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.830 
listened about some experience in
the past, where people start

41
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.420 
eating a lot at home and even
taking some alcohol because they

42
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.640 
need to relax somehow and you are
developing another problem.

43
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.140 
Yeah, treating a problem with another.
Exactly, you are starting a new

44
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.380 
problem trying to make a solution
but you're bringing another

45
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.400 
problem on sight. Therefore, when you
define a task when you define a task

46
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.500 
just not because they are
working remotely, don't

47
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.670 
you think they have all now
all the time in the world.

48
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.410 
be realistic, you knew how did the
times were at any office. Keep that

49
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.180 
that people outside
will have more

50
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.070 
flexibility, that they will be
probably more creative in doing

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.130 
their job. Yes, but
keep things on the

52
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.650 
proper numbers.
It is difficult

53
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.420 
to have exactly the feeling what
is there, but this is the reason

54
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.910 
so the importance of the
communication, of the feedback.

55
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
Are you achieving this? No, why
are you not achieving this?

56
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.150 
because I miss this, I don't know
this tool of these resources.

57
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.530 
OK. Talk to IT bring
them more resources.

58
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.410 
It's because my internet
connection is down,

59
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.990 
because I don't know the
people that I am waiting for

60
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.950 
the information to be delivered,
or the resources to be delivered

61
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.220 
are not given to me. It is important
but don't put stress there.

62
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.680 
If you think that you started
putting stress outside

63
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.130 
you start making
a mistake.

64
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.020 
If there is stress bring it
here, discussed, talk,

65
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.300 
and exchange this, because
otherwise as I said before

66
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.300 
there are some conditions that
may lead people into trying

67
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.220 
to relieve that distress.... OK,
beside overcoming or trying

68
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.460 
to overcome these conditions,
what other factors we would say

69
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.580 
to motivate workers? OK, this is
a good point because whatever

70
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.300 
you say that you want to work
remotely is because of you probably

71
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.920 
will have... you want to see more
things, you want to learn more

72
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.630 
things. If you keep people
intellectually motivated because

73
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.190 
they need to read, the need to
take a challenge, they need to

74
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.480 
I do not know... to visit another organization,
and start exchanging more information.

75
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.710 
This richness makes the
motivation by far higher.

76
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.650 
We see already in some teams
that they move from Germany

77
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.130 
to the UK when they start now
interacting in another language.

78
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.650 
Normally, in Germany speak German
but they were interacting in

79
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.670 
English was a huge motivation for
them because they were learning.

80
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.760 
They were motivated to
doing something new

81
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.520 
and this is very challenging
for them, and this

82
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.260 
is very good for
the motivation.

83
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.690 
Work properly is
defining clear targets

84
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.470 
as I said before if you define
a target that is not clear

85
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.120 
not achievable in the deadlines,
you are killing the people.

86
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.050 
You are not bringing any
further to the organization,

87
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.520 
you are bringing people into
stress, your productivity will

88
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.090 
go down and of course, you will
not achieve the target that

89
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.280 
you wanted to achieve.
Therefore offer the

90
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.190 
people, the remote workers, something
doable. Offer them perspectives,

91
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.150 
after we achieve this, we are
going to achieve this, and then

92
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.010 
you define a line where they
see a there is progress there

93
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.690 
they are recognizing that
I'm working properly

94
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.150 
and then achieving some of
the different things.

95
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.940 
Whenever you are out there and
people start communicating

96
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.760 
you need to think that people
are communicating with whom?

97
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.420 
to customers, to competitors, also
to some part of the management,

98
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.710 
or to a part of the teams. Make
sure that you know who are the

99
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.910 
interaction with because based
also in the tools that are using

100
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.770 
for the interaction, you also will
need to make some adaptations.

101
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.320 
Probably for making meetings
internally you will have

102
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.010 
video channels, which are
open to more people

103
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.050 
but if you are talking to
customers, let's make sure that

104
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.840 
the customers are not
reaching his private line.

105
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.070 
They are not working, you're
not calling him at home.

106
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.200 
You need to make sure that
you are bringing all the

107
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.090 
infrastructure
there so that is

108
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.740 
the infrastructure is still under
control. If someone is going

109
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.660 
to call the customer sorry, the
employee later on but this employee

110
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.330 
is gone at least you route the
number to a different person

111
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.580 
and you are just keeping
this under control.

112
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.290 
This is very important
because when people start

113
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.750 
interacting outside of the
infrastructure that you define,

114
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.300 
it is really difficult to keep
control out of this and then you

115
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:45.790 
may at the end lose a lot of information and you
may also lose control of the infrastructure

116
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.640 
You need to track performance.
How you track performance?

117
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.560 
You define timelines because you
define a task because you have

118
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.640 
say "I want to achieve with these
three people in this team

119
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.990 
this task" and for that.
There are tools that

120
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.740 
allow you to coordinate these.
We saw already in the

121
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.080 
past with Tom, that there are
tools that allow you to

122
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.100 
interact and to say who is doing
what. What is achieved, what

123
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.010 
was not. Those are definitely
something (tools) that

124
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.530 
bring the team further. Not to
know what are they doing if they

125
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.860 
are... I'm ready to deliver something.
Make meetings, meetings also give

126
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.230 
a lot of motivation because
we will see each other.

127
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.740 
If we don't have internet
connection problems of course,

128
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.120 
we will see each other, we will
share all the information that we

129
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.130 
have achieved and also talk
about what you experience.

130
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.320 
It keeps the people motivated and
I have a problem because my

131
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.800 
dog I don't know... is
all the time here! Then

132
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.850 
who is solving this kind
of problem there?

133
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.800 
I need to travel also for
one hour to fetch my kids?

134
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.040 
All this kind of... Remember
we are humans and

135
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.540 
the reason why we are making also
this, or part of the reasons

136
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.010 
is because we want a work-life
balance and all this stuff they

137
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.710 
need to be cautious of course. If
there are some things private

138
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.260 
you will not go
and discuss

139
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.870 
in a meeting would we all the
people that probably you can

140
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.110 
talk to your leader and you
explain why things are happening

141
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.290 
like that but this will keep people
motivated. OK, they accept

142
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.910 
there is a situation and they are
part still of the organization

143
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.990 
and they count on this, When
you also share information.

144
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.960 
With people trying to make
video communication,

145
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.110 
video as I said
before, face time.

146
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.600 
Is fantastic but if you don't
have a face time then just

147
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.310 
try to go to the video and try to
exchange information per video.

148
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.730 
This is what we wanted to say
today about that. Thank

149
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.380 
you Salim. And now, we would
like to hear from you. What

150
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.000 
additional personality
aspects would you consider

151
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:50.280 
relevant to this topic? What factors,
what things might motivate

152
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.480 
you or demotivate you when
practicing remote work?

153
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.430 
Please post any questions, any
experience, any comments and join

154
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.330 
the discussion.
Thank you Hanadi.

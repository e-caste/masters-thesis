00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.520 
In our OpenHPI course about digital identities,
now we want to consider in more detail

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.390 
authentication methods

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.040 
There are various methods in place, methods
that are based on knowledge, ownership,

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.760 
biometrics, and behavior.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.250 
You remember that when you want
to use an online service,

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.570 
the online service is used
by your digital identity.

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.310 
You have interface of registering,
established a digital identity,

8
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.900 
and if you come back to the service you have
to prove that this certain digital identity

9
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.230 
belongs to you.

10
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
And this a process for proving
ownership of a digital identity

11
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.160 
requires two phases the Authentification
and the Authentication phases.

12
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.940 
Authentification is to produce evidence
to the system that you are the person

13
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.380 
that belongs to that
digital identity.

14
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.180 
And in the Authentication phase the
system validates this evidence.

15
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
In practice, this all together
this is called Authentication.

16
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.360 
But it is very
important

17
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
to use this system, otherwise
you will not get access.

18
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.300 
And if you remember the most popular
authentication methods are

19
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.230 
password entry,the use of passwords.

20
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.670 
So as the person produces evidence to
the system in the phase of authentification

21
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.720 
by knowing a certain password
that he or she owns

22
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.360 
a digital identity. So the system
asks for a secret password,

23
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
and if the user

24
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.300 
gives the right
password then the

25
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.570 
service considers this
as a proof that this

26
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.900 
identity belongs
to the user.

27
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.360 
There are different types
of authentication

28
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.470 
in the real world in addition to the use
of passwords, the most popular method

29
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.970 
there are other types
of authentication

30
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.710 
which are based for example,
on certain knowledge.

31
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.730 
This is a password or an ownership
of something, or a biometric.

32
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.090 
So in case of authentication through
knowledge, the knowledge of a secret

33
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.970 
is checked. A secret that's only
known to the user and the service.

34
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.560 
They share as a secret
for example a password, or

35
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.350 
a pin or a
TAN or other things.

36
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.360 
The secret could also be a
graphical one, for example,

37
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.550 
some specific points in an image
that need to be detected.

38
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.160 
Or that select pictures
with friends of them.

39
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:20.260 
So the secret the user is asked by the system
can be provided in different forms,

40
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.460 
most common in the form
of a password.

41
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.380 
What are the
advantages and disadvantages

42
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.810 
of an authentication
through knowledge?

43
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.210 
Advantage of course is its widespread
use, everyone knows and is familar

44
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.710 
with this work,
for example,

45
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.310 
he knows that he or she has to
give an user name and a password. It

46
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.660 
is a simple application

47
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.690 
and it is easy to change the
secret. Some systems insist on

48
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.560 
a regular basis that the
password is changed. Other systems

49
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.050 
provide the forgotten button
and in this way one can

50
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.830 
introduce a new password and there is no
special hardware no special system required.

51
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.390 
But there are also disadvantages,
the disadvantages are that the security

52
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.960 
depends on the
complexity of that secret,

53
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.490 
and we see a lot of misuse in the
internet because users select

54
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.810 
very weak passwords and of course
the more complex the secret is

55
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.670 
the better, the more difficult it
is to guess or in another way

56
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.870 
for a non authority
person to get access to it.

57
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.760 
But this is a problem, the more difficult
it is, the more difficult to remember.

58
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.920 
That is the reason why many people
choose very weak passwords,

59
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.690 
being not aware that this allows
attackers to get their digital identity

60
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.840 
in their hand and to
be able to misus it.

61
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.540 
And then, if you have to

62
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.230 
log in in many different
services, then many different secrets

63
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.560 
have to be remembered
and this is hard.

64
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.590 
So there are authentication methods
in place. One is through ownership.

65
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.220 
In the case of authentication by
ownership, the existence of a particular

66
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.830 
object is checked. So for
example, a signet ring,

67
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.900 
this was a traditional way, or an
identity card or a membership card

68
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.330 
or an USB token.

69
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
The system checks whether a user owns
this system, owns such a device,

70
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.940 
and the ownership gives a proof to
to the service

71
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:06.480 
that this is the real user
which belongs to the digital identity.

72
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.850 
After showing this object
the access is granted.

73
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.770 
Here the advantage is no special
knowledge is necessary, no secrets

74
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:27.730 
are needed, simply to prove that a
you own this special device.

75
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.850 
The disadvantages are
of course that the

76
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.910 
object in ownership can be
lost and without this

77
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.960 
signature card or without
the USB token,

78
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.340 
one will not get
access to the service.

79
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.600 
The object in ownership can also be stolen
or a thief can get direct access

80
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.450 
to the system by misuse
of the stolen device

81
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.470 
and in this way to take
over the digital identity

82
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.370 
for his purpose.

83
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:15.300 
In many cases to show this object to
the system, additional hardware is

84
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.150 
needed for example,
a card reader.

85
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:29.300 
There is another third way to authenticate
through biometric features.

86
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.080 
Biometric authentication
is based on verification

87
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.360 
of some physical characteristics for
example a fingerprint or facial

88
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.270 
shape or the
iris or others.

89
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.670 
Also the behavior can be
checked by means of a smartphone,

90
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.590 
after a few steps,

91
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:59.440 
by using the specifics of the
movements one can detect whether a

92
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.700 
person is the right
person or not.

93
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:10.040 
The typing behavior with the keyboard
is very characteristic from

94
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:18.140 
user to user and can be used for such
authentication methods. Or movement patterns,

95
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.380 
you knows as from
your smartphone.

96
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:27.070 
The advantage here is although no
special knowledge is necessary,

97
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.780 
no ownership is necessary,
your biometric features

98
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.770 
are unique and you
have it with you

99
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:41.390 
in any place, the features are
unique to each person. You remember

100
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.620 
this with the fingerprint, I spoke
about this behavior,

101
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:52.190 
this movement characteristics,
so this is very easy

102
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.120 
for authentication. But
there are also disadvantages.

103
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.190 
Special hardware is needed to
record a physical characteristics

104
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.530 
for example, to get
the fingerprint or

105
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.690 
see the face.

106
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.920 
The other thing the

107
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:20.920 
ID provider has to store this information.
These are very personal information,

108
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.750 
your fingerprint
or others.

109
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.120 
So testing is
also not simple.

110
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.570 
Because these biometric
characteristics

111
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:40.130 
hold only with high probability,
but are not an absolute proof.

112
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:47.310 
So it enables to produce counterfeits
and the counterfeiting

113
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.480 
has to be good enough

114
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.870 
to give the cyber attacker a chance to
overcome his is authentication methods.

115
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.470 
And then another disadvantage is, when
a feature is compromised

116
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.670 
then it's impossible to change
it. You have only ten fingers

117
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:16.160 
and if one fingerprint is compromised,
there are only nine remaining.

118
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.510 
So you see all these different methods
authentication methods have their

119
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.020 
advantages and have
their disadvantages.

120
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:34.090 
So the idea that becomes more and
more popular, is not using one way or

121
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:41.050 
one feature for authentication, but using
multi factors for authentication.

122
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.730 
And the idea behind it is exactly
to compensate the disadvantages

123
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.920 
of the single authentication methods,

124
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.060 
one applies two
or more methods.

125
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:59.870 
So in such a multi factor authentication, it
results in the simultaneous communication

126
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.170 
of several different
authentication methods,

127
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.780 
called factors in
this context.

128
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.740 
And two factor authentication of
course is a combination of two

129
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.120 
different authentication methods.

130
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.350 
Here are two examples, the first
example is the cash card

131
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.190 
for accessing a
bank account.

132
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.930 
You have to prove

133
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.320 
for authentication, you have
to prove to own the card,

134
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.790 
and then you have to prove a
knowledge to know the pin

135
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.410 
which opens the card. Or
another example,

136
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.090 
the website account with
two factor authentication.

137
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.640 
In the first factor you have
to prove to know a password,

138
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:54.180 
the knowledge and then you have to prove
the ownership of your smartphone,

139
00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:00.360 
for example, with a TAN generator
or receive TAN for using

140
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:06.820 
in the context of online banking,
and to guarantee that

141
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:14.970 
the person that is authenticating really
belongs to the right digital identity.

142
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.210 
Let's summarize these different
types of authentication.

143
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.430 
There are three classes or
factors of authentication.

144
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.150 
Authentications that are based
on knowledge, authentications

145
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.180 
that are based on ownership, authentications
that are based on biometrics

146
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.550 
on physical characteristics
and behavior.

147
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.810 
Each of these classes have its
advantages and disadvantages.

148
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:50.500 
So a secure method of authentication is the
simultaneous combination of several types

149
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.300 
of authentication methods. In a two factor
authentication, two different methods are

150
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.010 
combined in a
multi-factor

151
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.750 
authentication,
eventually more.

152
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.480 
However, the combination of
course increases the security

153
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.700 
of authentication, but
the price is the usability.

154
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.570 
There are more steps necessary
to authenticate and

155
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:25.140 
to produce the authentication
evidence. There are more means

156
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:32.450 
needed to do this. So we see here is a
trade-off between usability and security

157
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:39.230 
and nevertheless at least two
two-factor authentications

158
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.490 
are today considered secure.

1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.770 
a very dangerous family of
attacks with misusing on the

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.450 
open networks is spoofing. spoofing
is to work and to move with

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.400 
the faked address. spoofing is described
as the faking of all types of addresses.

4
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.630 
you remember that in the internet
there are many different addresses.

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.160 
hardware address of machine, the
addresses as that are used

6
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.590 
by the internet, address that is
used for domain name service.

7
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.310 
the addresses that are used
for different applications.

8
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.580 
and spooling is the idea
of to sent message

9
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.370 
with faked address. with
a fake sender address.

10
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.760 
usually this attack is done as a
preparation for further attacks.

11
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.410 
for example to send a email
from a family remember.

12
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.900 
then people are very
trustful and do something

13
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.930 
which force the family
member to do something,

14
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.440 
by this email. and the
email does not come from

15
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.600 
a family member, but
came from an attacker.

16
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.500 
the usage is that sending
packets with such

17
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.770 
fakes address to
cover a up attacks

18
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.000 
or to gain access to protect a
system under a false identity.

19
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.640 
for example working with a
third party's target address.

20
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
the idea behind is
to obtain data

21
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.480 
intended for that third party. for
example with men in the middle

22
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.850 
attacks and others. let's start
with considering ip address

23
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.480 
spoofing. that means spoofing the
internet address. ip spoofing

24
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
refers to the use of faked ip
addresses for message to third

25
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.980 
parties. the attacker spoofing
as a trusted sender

26
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.390 
generates and sends a data packet
with a fake sender address

27
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:16.510 
to the victim. this does
not work generally.

28
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.310 
the limitation is usually
this ip spoofing works only

29
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.290 
with connectionless protocols.
for example UDP and ICMP,

30
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.100 
where no response is expected.
because, of course, the response

31
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.370 
is sent to the fake
address. so the attacker

32
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.720 
does not receive does
not receive the

33
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.500 
response. the ip
spoofing works

34
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.380 
when we have connection-oriented
protocols,

35
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.900 
ip spoofing woks only with
connection-oriented protocols when

36
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.300 
access to an intermediate
system is possible.

37
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.490 
so the reason is that also
here is a response packet

38
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.120 
can be intercepted by the
attacker that in the interacted

39
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.100 
system. because he
cannot receive it

40
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.050 
on a direct way. take scenario
and it looks like follows.

41
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.980 
the attacker conceals him
or herself, take a fakes

42
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.720 
his or her own address, so that
it looks like to comes from

43
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.490 
somewhere else to perform an
attack. for example, to apply a

44
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.870 
denial of service attack or the
distributed denial of service

45
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.110 
attack. the attacker does
not use its own address

46
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.810 
he works with the
address of the victim.

47
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.850 
it cannot be determined
who is a real attacker.

48
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.180 
to shows this,
Alice is the user

49
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.620 
of the bank, the ip
addresses of the bank is

50
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.140 
192.168.0.1. alice,
which has ip address

51
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.940 
192.168.13.1/

52
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.970 
and here the attacker is
with the ip address with

53
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.460 
192.168.13.2.

54
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.820 
so it's different that what
from alice sends a mail

55
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.480 
to the bank misusing the
ip address from alice.

56
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.300 
so this is an attack for example
denial of service attack

57
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.720 
so when the attack is analyzed,
the result shows the attack

58
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.560 
should come from Alice, in
reality the attacker is

59
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.100 
naive, who misused the
ip address from Alice.

60
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.920 
what are countermeasures against
such ip address spoofing?

61
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.620 
one should set up a good
a filtering rules

62
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.800 
on the firewall. for example
blocking packets from an external

63
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.550 
network that come with
internal ip address.

64
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.240 
because this is a typical sign
that someone else from outside

65
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.970 
is misusing an internet
address to into.

66
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.240 
and this is also an idea
of the ip spoofing.

67
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.810 
if the rule of the
firewall is not

68
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.100 
carefully settled, the firewall
treats interna packets in

69
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.120 
a different way to
external packages.

70
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.260 
and in this way is
that the attacker

71
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.360 
by spoofing the ip address by
misusing in internal address

72
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.910 
but coming from the
outside to the firewall

73
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.980 
tries to get the
firewall or to apply

74
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.800 
and not to look at
carefully to the content.

75
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.470 
and then is another a
countermeasure is that one

76
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.710 
should use connection oriented
protocol. because the connection

77
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.480 
oriented protocols for
example such as TCP

78
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.850 
anticipate the creation of the
bidirectional connection.

79
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.800 
generally, an attacker
with a fake IP

80
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.360 
address cannot get a response.
because tcp establish a connection

81
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.000 
between the two communication
partners so the attacker

82
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.260 
can start to communicate
but then the

83
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.750 
reply is sent to the original
address and not to

84
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.200 
the attacker's address.
another countermeasure is

85
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.350 
a strong out indication. use of
secure out indication methods.

86
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.770 
for example IPSEC.
the IPSEC

87
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.520 
it's a protocol that
prevents sender false.

88
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.510 
i said spoofing can be applied
on different levels. we

89
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.870 
spoke about using spoofing, spoofing
of ip address on the network

90
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.680 
level, but spoofing can also
be a applied on application

91
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.880 
level. for example in
the context of dns.

92
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.600 
domain same service. dns spoofing
refers to faking an association

93
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.920 
between dns name ,that's the
computer name and ip address.

94
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.790 
the idea of the domain name
services that we are able

95
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.560 
to work with textual
names and not with its

96
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.840 
number names. so is there is, domain
name service has the possibility

97
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.740 
to connect to associated ip
address with such a textual

98
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.350 
address. and exactly the
idea of spoofing is

99
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.850 
to manipulate this association
so to place false entry

100
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.710 
into domain name service,
which a in the fact redirect

101
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.380 
legitimate dns addresses to the
ip address of the attacker.

102
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.040 
so the attack methods
are following:

103
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.470 
to manipulate the domain name
service cash, the DNS cache.

104
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.250 
on the victims' computer, the
idea of such catches is

105
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.190 
to remember the association
of the textual name,

106
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.530 
of an ip address. because
to computes, is difficult

107
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:29.600 
and it needs time. so in the cache,
there is the association it stored

108
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.970 
with the ip address and the
corresponding the dns address.

109
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.490 
and now is the attack
method is timing attack.

110
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.360 
the idea is that a response is faked
to the victims' dns request.

111
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.530 
so when the victim
tries to find out

112
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.770 
what is the
domain name or

113
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.660 
wants to find out ip address.
he sends a request to the

114
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.990 
domain name server and if
the attacker is able

115
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:08.110 
to send the wrong arms
before the original arms

116
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.800 
from legitimate dns server
to reach the cash,

117
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.690 
then the first response is sorted,
the first response is considered

118
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.440 
of the implementation
of the domain name

119
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.780 
server. for cache, it is
first come first served.

120
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.000 
what are countermeasures? the
countermeasure is one has to install

121
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.260 
updates for dns server software.
so with highlight ability

122
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.710 
to dns spoofing due to many
vulnerabilities in the domain name.

123
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.930 
this is very
complex software

124
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.000 
from time to time, new
vulnerabilities were

125
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.190 
found and with the update this
kind of vulnerabilities

126
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:57.520 
are closed. another countermeasure
one should use is DNSSEC.

127
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.820 
this is a secure version of a
domain name service protocol.

128
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.630 
here, the mapping
between ip and dns

129
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:14.880 
is certified by signatures.
so the receiver

130
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:22.180 
the dns client can see
whether the response comes

131
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.110 
from the dns
server or not.

132
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.630 
the verification of the digital
certificated of the actual target

133
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.820 
server. this means that the
signature should be controlled.

134
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.430 
the certificate should
be issued for domain

135
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.630 
name service name and after
establishing a connection to

136
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:53.910 
a certificate- based TLS/SSL
service. for example https,

137
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.810 
the validity of the
digital certification

138
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.950 
for a given domain can be
verified. let look at an example

139
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.100 
so we start we
have here, Alice

140
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:11.760 
we have here, our attacker, we
have here again bank.com.

141
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.710 
we see ip addresses i
already mentioned,

142
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.750 
and here is the a domain name service
and the domain name service

143
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.480 
is a connection association
between the textual

144
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.820 
name bank.com and an ip address
.and the idea of that

145
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.030 
attack is to manipulate
this to change this old

146
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.300 
connection association between
the textual name and the ip

147
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.490 
address which is exactly the
right ip address of the

148
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.190 
bank server to replace
the right ip address

149
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.920 
by is the ip address of
the attacker. and then

150
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.730 
in the consequence all
he send to the bank

151
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.740 
is not to the bank
but is sent to the

152
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:06.080 
attacker. so the attacker
manipulates now. let's discuss it.

153
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:11.620 
the attacker is able
to manipulate this

154
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.120 
dns table and now when
Alice asked for the ip

155
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:22.760 
of bank.com, there is the
table looked up to down,

156
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.400 
and she gets the answer,
the wrong answer.

157
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:33.810 
the entrance here
of the bank.com

158
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.530 
is associated with the ip
address of the attacker.

159
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.900 
and then when alice tries
to connect to the bank,

160
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.010 
in reality, they are
connected to the attacker

161
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.920 
and then for example the
attacker can present

162
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.800 
and look in page. and she is
assuming and is assuming she has

163
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.410 
is connected to the bank,
gives the user name, gives

164
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.930 
the password and then
the attacker has both.

165
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.970 
another example i want to
give is e-mails spoofing.

166
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:20.100 
it's also possible to send emails
and it's very simple way

167
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.890 
to send emails with a
fake sender address.

168
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.330 
use of bogus address when sending
spam and phishing emails

169
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.460 
and the idea of both cases
is to gain users' trust.

170
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.140 
and emails frequently obtain
malicious software.

171
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:48.090 
for example an attachment.
the e-mails says open

172
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.060 
this and then you will get something
or you win something or you

173
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:57.030 
can see something. and when
the user is openings

174
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.090 
the attachment, sender's
malicious software is

175
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.230 
loaded. you remember we
discussed this already.

176
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.310 
of course, if this email come from
an unknown address, the user will

177
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.640 
much more critical then if
such an email comes from a

178
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.260 
trusted person. so the
basic problem is

179
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.500 
the identity of the
sender. It is typically

180
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.380 
not checked by an
email server. so

181
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.910 
it's very simple to fake the
email address and then to send

182
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:36.250 
this email with a fake
address. the email recipient

183
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.300 
has no way to verify this
sender's address later.

184
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.620 
if it's not done by
the email server,

185
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:49.190 
then it's a impossible to do it later.
such a concrete attack method

186
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.820 
for e-mails spoofing can
look as following.

187
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.910 
the idea of attack is to
change and display sender.

188
00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:03.300 
email protocols, SMTP protocol
and those that designed to

189
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:08.050 
show the sender's adorers
and sender's name.

190
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.310 
for example that if the
sender's address is a

191
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.440 
quite complicated email address,
in this display, only the name

192
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.480 
can be shown, the sender.
so this diaplay name

193
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.870 
then is choose as
a trusted name.

194
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.980 
for example, OpenHPI is
displayed but in reality it

195
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.650 
is the attacker behind
the attacker address

196
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:40.580 
attacker@domain.come. so
correct email addresses is

197
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.610 
not displayed in every email program.
but what we have to say is

198
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.370 
that more and more
email programs are

199
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.400 
checking the sender in
the email program

200
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:57.170 
it becomes more common and
typically both name and addresses

201
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.780 
are shown. there is
another attack method.

202
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:07.380 
this attack method is
sending emails via open

203
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:14.400 
email server, or open
relay server. such type

204
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.590 
of e-mails server
accept the sending of

205
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.700 
each sender address without
verifying the sender's account.

206
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.390 
so this is misused for example for
sending bank emails or fishing

207
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.020 
mails. and it's simply a
false server configuration.

208
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.930 
but such type of service
offer this service.

209
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.680 
such a service is, however,
relatively quickly detected and

210
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.280 
blocked by email
providers.

211
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.470 
it's called blacklisting.
another quite successful

212
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.550 
attack method for e-mails
spoofing is using very similar

213
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.850 
looking domain names. and
malicious center registers and

214
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.770 
email domain that looks similar
to a trustworthy domain. for

215
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:09.660 
example uni-potsdarn
instead of uni

216
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:14.650 
-potsdam. at first, it
looks very similar

217
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.770 
and you need to look very careful
to find out that there is a

218
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.930 
difference. this is
the domain name

219
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.230 
of the university potsdam, and
this is a domain name of a

220
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:35.380 
cyber criminal person. what are
countermeasures to prevent

221
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.610 
email spoofing? first,
one countermeasure is

222
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.050 
to sign emails. only
a legitimate sender

223
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.650 
able by means of his
private key generating

224
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.420 
a signature in such a way that
it can be recognized that

225
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.360 
this email really comes
from that person.

226
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.910 
next week we will speak about
this such of signature

227
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.800 
procedures. another
countermeasure is generally

228
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.530 
not trusting messages
from unknown sources,

229
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.080 
especially when they

230
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.740 
prompting you to do
something. for example

231
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.340 
to open the email, to open the
file, or to entering user data.

232
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.490 
then you should be a
very very careful and

233
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:36.510 
not to trust. you see
the weakness of

234
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.590 
the internet protocols, of
all the internet protocols,

235
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.660 
the missing of indication
makes it possible

236
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.920 
that attackers can acts and
can run a number of attacks

237
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:55.030 
by using a wrong sender address. it
can be done with services like

238
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.100 
dns, it can be
done with the

239
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.310 
internet protocols, that
can be done with email.

240
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:05.310 
so here you need to know
there is a danger and

241
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.630 
you has to carefully apply the
proposed countermeasures.

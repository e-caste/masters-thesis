00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670 
hello good people.
my name is Reza Hadi Mogavi and i'm a phd student

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.770 
at hong kong university of science and technology.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.980 
today i will present you our latest work about a student
barriers to active learning in synchronous online classes.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.870 
this work has been conducted with my co-authors,

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.840 
Mr. Zhao, Mr.Haq, Dr.Hu and Dr.Ma .

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.150 
over the past decade online education has rapidly expanded in popularity.

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.260 
i am very recently due to covid 19 pandemic.

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.830 
many university instructors have shifted their classes online.

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.110 
online education can take different forms in a broad categorisation.

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.570 
it can be synchronous or asynchronous.

11
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.000 
synchronous learning is facilitated with platforms like

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.880 
zoom blackboard google mit and etcetera.

13
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.920 
i'm pretty sure most of you are already familiar with these platforms.

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.480 
in seconds learning instructors and students interact each

15
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
other at the same time in real time.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.710 
asynchronous learning is exactly the opposite. in this form

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.510 
of online education.
there is usually no real time interaction

18
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.180 
between instructors and students.

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
more platforms, such as dex coursera and shooting exe

20
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.390 
are good examples for this type of online education.

21
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.390 
our work here is focused on synchronous online classes.

22
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.640 
ok synchronous learning can also be offered with different

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
types of pedagogies or teaching styles. for example it could

24
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.580 
be either passive learning or active learning.

25
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.320 
impassive learning students are expected to assimilate information

26
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340 
only through listening to an instructor or watching lectures.

27
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.410 
passive learning often takes the form of memorization or rote

28
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.550 
learning. however, this is sadly not very practical or productive.

29
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.190 
in active learning on the other hand students participate in

30
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.630 
the process of learning by doing educational activities and

31
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.540 
thinking about what they really do.

32
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.390 
they try to own their knowledge through a hands on and minds on approach.

33
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.830 
the advantages of active learning include increased duration

34
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.850 
of attention retention in classes.

35
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420 
better critical thinking and improved inter-personal skills,

36
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.550 
and fewer course failures. because of all of these benefits.

37
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.340 
and its importance our work here is focused on studying active

38
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.340 
learning in synchronous online classes.

39
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.720 
we answer three research questions. first what are the student

40
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.590 
barriers to active learning in synchronous online classes.

41
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.180 
second how do expert active learning educators reflect on the student barriers found.

42
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.690 
our finally how could our findings be beneficial for novice educators.

43
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.120 
accordingly we conduct three qualitative studies with hong

44
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.540 
kong based academia to answer each of our research questions.

45
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.370 
the study one explores what students perceive as barriers to

46
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.040 
active learning in online synchronous classes.

47
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.030 
the study two shows how expert educators reflect on
the barriers students mention.

48
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.150 
the study two also once triangulated our findings from study one.

49
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.760 
and finally the study three shows how novice educators can

50
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.690 
benefit from our list of barriers for planning their
active online classes.

51
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.850 
meticulous details of each of these studies are provided
inside our paper.

52
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.760 
so if you're interested,

53
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
you can kindly check it there.

54
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.250 
through a careful thematic analysis

55
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.950 
rebuild a detailed reference for understanding student barriers

56
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.380 
to active learning in synchronous.
online classes. all in all,

57
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.030 
we find twenty eight granular barriers within the general themes of

58
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.120 
human side technological and environmental barriers again for

59
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.390 
more information, you can kindly check our paper.

60
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.740 
but what are the main problems?

61
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.210 
there six staying focused is still the biggest challenge for students

62
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.770 
in active online classes.

63
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.820 
second incentives for online active learning might
be insufficient and unfair.

64
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.290 
third students cannot get timely help from their teacher

65
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.920 
in this type of education most of the times.

66
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.450 
fourth the communication efficiency of group work in an online

67
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.360 
setting is lower than face to face.

68
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.260 
fifth,active learning could be even more time consuming online.

69
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.410 
finally active online classes are sometimes more prone
to be an equitable.

70
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.460 
okay, but how can our barrier list help novice educators?

71
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.740 
according to our summative study novice educators can benefit

72
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.130 
from our parallel list in three ways.

73
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.890 
first, the barrier list can help novice educators not
to forget about non-technological barriers,

74
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.390 
because they often do.

75
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.540 
second, the barrier list can serve as a trustworthy and scientific reference for online

76
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.880 
course planning. and finally the barrier list can inspire educated

77
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.950 
educators to modify old active learning strategies
and make them more inclusive,

78
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.340 
which is very important.

79
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.190 
our work also presents some design suggestions to improve the

80
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.480 
quality in this type of online education.

81
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.210 
we suggest that developing new interaction designs based on

82
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.510 
new input phrase for example una are might be advantageous

83
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.210 
to improve a student's communication.

84
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.630 
different virtualization techniques can be applied to protect

85
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.620 
a student's privacy and transmit more visual information between students

86
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.540 
to enrich their quality of communications.
and finally we suggest

87
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.610 
that using or enabling instant communication tools between students

88
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.270 
might actually be useful for students' learning.

89
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.690 
this paper is of course more detail and has more information.

90
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.870 
but in summary we want to recap these actually materials.

91
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.930 
this paper is the first systematic research to characterize student

92
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.140 
barriers to active learning in synchronous online classes.

93
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.710 
in this work we successfully reveal and characterize twenty eight

94
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.140 
granular student barriers to active learning.

95
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.520 
and finally in overwork we discuss the main
problems students face and show

96
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.590 
the advantages of using our priorities for course planning

97
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.630 
through a summative study with novice educators.

98
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.310 
and i want to thank you all for your valuable time and attention.

99
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.680 
if there are any questions i would be glad to answer, or we

100
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.560 
can just send us an email. thank you so much again.

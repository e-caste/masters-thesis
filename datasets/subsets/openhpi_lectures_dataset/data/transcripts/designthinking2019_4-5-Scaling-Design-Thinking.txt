00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.960 
So a very important learning for our

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.120 
students is that this whole process,
the design thinking process is scalable.

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.720 
It can be a 3 hour thing,

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.600 
It can be a 3 day process,

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.240 
It can be a 3 weeks process,

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.080 
or it can be a full year.

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.040 
And this learning was also a learning

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.760 
for our partners, for a project partners
at the same time, because they are

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.920 
delivering the challenges and they
realize, wow, they are loops,

10
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.800 
there are interesting outcomes.

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.680 
So one of the questions of our project
partners falling out of the program,

12
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.720 
the student program was immediately

13
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.680 
how can we as management
learn the same thing?

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.160 
And so we were challenged to set up

15
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.480 
a program focusing on the needs
of business people.

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.760 
And this is not a semester program.

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.440 
So we had to kind
of shrink the whole thing.

18
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.920 
And this is also what we recommend
to companies and large organizations.

19
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.480 
Start small, start with a teaser format.

20
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.360 
One day or two day workshop to address

21
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.760 
a problem that also can be solved
in that short amount of time.

22
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.040 
But we figured out if you really want
to implement design thinking in your

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.160 
organizations, this kind of a 3
day little workshop is not enough.

24
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.960 
That was the feedback we got immediately
from people returning back

25
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160 
to the organization, completely excited
about the new things they learned.

26
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
And then they figured out the whole

27
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
organization is still
in that kind of Brockhaus mode.

28
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.200 
And they were the only ones
recommending you things.

29
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.240 
So we started thinking of what is
the management level 1, level 2?

30
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.760 
What amount of time can they
afford to spend here to learn more? And

31
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.360 
what is it? How should we scale that?

32
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.720 
So therefore, once you start scaling
design thinking as a mindset,

33
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520 
as an approach within your organization,
you will have those learnings

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.880 
on the outcomes side,
but also about the process in itself

35
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.080 
and also what's really needed in terms
of innovation and capacity building.

36
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.040 
So whom to actually initially to train,

37
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.920 
but also how to make use of that first
resource within your organization

38
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.240 
to trigger this across other functions,
across other departments,

39
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.280 
and then in the third step actually
to ignite this organizational change

40
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.880 
through also an organization
that not just uses the process,

41
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.000 
but also uses this process
in order to work differently.

42
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.600 
And this is the challenge

43
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.400 
a lot of organizations are facing right
now, who want to change their organization

44
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.920 
from a brockhaus structure
to a networked culture.

45
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.560 
They need tools for supporting thousands,ten

46
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.040 
thousands, hundred
thousands of people,

47
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.520 
And there's not time to wait.

48
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.760 
There is not the chance

49
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.520 
to physically get all people involved
in new environments at the same time.

50
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.920 
But there is probably a little chance

51
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.480 
using new technologies
to spread the word much faster.

52
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.640 
And besides initiating in such a way

53
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.600 
that change on a larger scale,
it's also about sustaining it, because we

54
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.440 
have these digital means as for example,
also where this kind of MOOCs

55
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.080 
we can share new learnings with also new
generations of co-workers,

56
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.280 
of employees. We haven't been there when we started

57
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.960 
the change, but we gonna take the
change a step forward into the future.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.530 
Hello everyone and thank you
for listening and viewing

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.120 
a short overview of cloud in two
thousand nineteen. My name is

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.540 
Boss Betzler. I'm a distinguished engineer with
IBM. I'm also a master inventor.

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.640 
In my day job I lead
the architecture guild for our solution

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.160 
activities that we do together
with customers, which means that

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.570 
I help our customers to better
realize their business potential on clouds

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.240 
and lead a team of different
individuals that ensure that architecture

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.620 
for a cloud is deployed in the
best possible way in solution designs that

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.360 
deploy different applications and workloads on
various clouds. These could be

10
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.780 
clouds on premise, these could
be different dedicated clouds

11
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.760 
or these could be a
variety of public clouds.

12
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.520 
What I'd like to spend
time today talking about is

13
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.980 
why there's so many clouds and
how can I tell them apart.

14
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.310 
And enterprises companies
established businesses start-ups

15
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.930 
how do they all differ or
are the same in exploiting, using

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
and deploying the
workload on cloud.

17
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.640 
And as a individual who is
tasked to develop applications for

18
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.920 
different companies, who is tasked to
consult companies, who is tasked to

19
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.310 
do operations or management
of workloads on cloud,

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.520 
what should I know about the use
of cloud? What should I know about

21
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.720 
building a cloud maybe a private
cloud? What should I know about

22
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.520 
building applications and building
workloads that are requested

23
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.860 
to run on clouds? As well as
how do I move an existing application

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.680 
maybe with minor modifications
onto cloud and

25
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.530 
in general what I need to
consider when managing applications on cloud.

26
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.390 
So in a variety of different
roles that you might find yourself,

27
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.570 
if you advise on cloud, if you
build for cloud or build a cloud,

28
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.370 
if you're moving into cloud, if you manage
cloud or if you are requested to

29
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.590 
assist with the governance and
optimization of IT,

30
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
which might include cloud and
a couple of other infrastructure,

31
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
then you want
to understand

32
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.510 
why is there a difference between
clouds. Why is there really

33
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.910 
a challenge in understanding how
to run a traditional application

34
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.850 
that runs on some dedicated IT
in a data center

35
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.810 
and deployed on cloud.

36
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.640 
Basic driver of cloud and cloud computing
as well as more distributed computing

37
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.900 
is really driven by
business requirements.

38
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.670 
We've traditionally seen that companies
who derive a value chain

39
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.240 
maybe out of different elements of
their value chain are able

40
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.660 
have been able in the past
to put them together and basically

41
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.510 
think of them as delivering
this value chain out of

42
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.790 
a building, out of a data centre, out
of their own company. This might include

43
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.250 
things like product
development, RnD,

44
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.020 
build and manufacturing of that
product, optimisation of that product,

45
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.300 
and an interaction with within customers.
But what we see increasingly

46
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.090 
with new entrance into businesses be
that into the retail business, into

47
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
the mobility and transportation business
or maybe also as an

48
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.560 
example in
financial services,

49
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.990 
we see new entrants, new companies
that come up, that do not

50
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.180 
realize the complete value chain
but optimize and specialize

51
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.870 
in individual elements of
such a value chain.

52
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.550 
To derive such a value out of
a specific element of that value chain,

53
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.330 
they might not require or need
their own data center or

54
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.270 
they might be a lot more
flexible in delivering that value

55
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
if they do not have the baggage
of building up their own IT

56
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.220 
staff to run a data center. So, many
of the year startups for example in

57
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.270 
financial services are able to
attract a lot of

58
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.260 
consumers, a lot of customers to
their a banking platform because

59
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.210 
they're able to deliver new
services quickly, they're able to

60
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.150 
deliver those services at a
very cost-effective price point

61
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.150 
and they're also able to use
different forms of media and different

62
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.850 
forms of interaction application or
form factors of mobile

63
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.950 
devices to interact
with their customers.

64
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.430 
That means that they do not have the
baggage of some of the traditional companies

65
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.860 
when it comes to the capabilities
of a data center and maybe

66
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.470 
also the capital investment in
such a data center.

67
00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.580 
Now out of that mix of
new entrants into the marketplace as

68
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.250 
well as some existing and
traditional companies, we see the

69
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.380 
emergence of new ecosystems. As
new ecosystems develop, that

70
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.330 
also means that they need to be
able to connect, to mash, to

71
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.630 
interact with one another which is
also driver for additional capabilities

72
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.360 
around APIs and
calling of services.

73
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.950 
So all of that together

74
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.920 
really drives a couple of requirements out
of business capabilities that are needed

75
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.760 
into demands for the
cloud that businesses demand.

76
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.670 
One is the example of
cost flexibility, the ability to

77
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.130 
quickly be able to use resources, use
services at the very cost-effective price point.

78
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.490 
Or the element of business
scalability. Many of these new entrants,

79
00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.260 
they might start they may start
with an online bank and within

80
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.810 
a couple of months a couple
of years at hundred thousands if

81
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.610 
not millions of new
consumers, new customers.

82
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.220 
In order to keep keep pace
with that increasing number of

83
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.670 
consumers and customers obviously also the
required resources in the IT

84
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.790 
fabric need to scale
at the same level.

85
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.380 
Market adaptability might need that
maybe for a seasonal

86
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.930 
workload maybe quickly for
a couple of weeks, months

87
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.590 
or even just days if
we think of black friday,

88
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.550 
a lot of resources are available
to support the number of transaction

89
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.140 
that happens during
such a day.

90
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.930 
Another element of
it is also

91
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.200 
mass complexity. So, handling of
hardware, cabling of servers,

92
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.810 
connecting different servers
to a network,

93
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.850 
maintaining storage platforms

94
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.260 
is characterized by a huge set
of complexity for those that

95
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.480 
operate and interact with those
IT resources. That also means

96
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.480 
that for a new entrant
quickly building out consumer services,

97
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.230 
they would like to rid themself
of the baggage of having

98
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.550 
specific skills that are able to
do these task and rather try

99
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.840 
to delegate these to experts
that are experts in

100
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.260 
setting up data centres, cabling
servers and maintaining the

101
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.710 
environmentals for
data centre.

102
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.780 
Now another element is

103
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.890 
ecosystem connectivity.

104
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.910 
I mentioned before that new ecosystems emerge
that are really a match or

105
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.930 
a set of connected elements in
an ecosystem. Now obviously that requires

106
00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:03.020 
a strong network capability, a capability to
connect to services, to consume services

107
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.910 
and to move and interact workloads as
well as the data with it.

108
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.520 
And these business drivers that
I quickly went through,

109
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.920 
interestingly enough they're very closely
related to the elements

110
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.900 
of the NIST cloud definition. There's
in the early days of cloud, NIST

111
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.970 
institute came up with a set
of definitions what cloud is

112
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.710 
and interestingly enough the
business drivers mapped quite

113
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.770 
clearly to several
of the

114
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:41.380 
specific definitions out of NIST. For
example, you can easily connect the

115
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.780 
need for cost flexibility with
the on-demand self service capability

116
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.510 
that a cloud is described to
have. What does that mean? That

117
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.670 
basically means that services
resources capabilities are available

118
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.870 
at the point in time when they are
demanded as well as that the consumer

119
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.540 
and be that a
application or a

120
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.030 
human requesting resources is able
to provision those resources

121
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.870 
maybe through an automated interface
but definitely at the

122
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.460 
point in time that
these resources are required.

123
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.510 
Business scalability

124
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.520 
is provided through resource pooling, which means
there is a huge resource pool.

125
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.400 
In this resource pool typically these
resource pools typically are shared

126
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:33.860 
and then as each user has their
own level of consumption of the resources,

127
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.220 
there is a certain white space
available in the pool for other

128
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.200 
participants or for other tenants or for
other users in the pool to use.

129
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.720 
That gives, the huger this
pool is, a tremendous scalability.

130
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.300 
Market adaptability can easily be connected
with measured service. If I

131
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.840 
a consumer service
and if I

132
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.630 
am required to pay exactly for
the part of the service that

133
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.700 
I consume, for the consumption time,
then of course I can quickly

134
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.890 
adapt to market requirements, I
can maybe scale down services

135
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.470 
that are not needed after black
friday or quickly scale up

136
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.840 
the resources that I need to
get that additional million of

137
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.160 
consumers for
my business.

138
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:26.770 
Mass complexity has to do with
the different abstraction layer that NIST defines.

139
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:33.320 
Infrastructure layer being a relative
coarse-grained and relatively low level

140
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.530 
and very high complexity level
of infrastructure and of service

141
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.510 
than a more abstracted service, platform
as a service where higher level

142
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.630 
capabilities of a
platform are provided

143
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.690 
for the consumption
by the workloads, by the applications,

144
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.420 
by the application programmer or even
software as a service where

145
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.580 
complete software or even
business processes over time

146
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.980 
being provided services and can
be consumed by users directly.

147
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.820 
Now the context driven variability
means that I can quickly

148
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.590 
react maybe even in a programmed manner.
If I have a web server

149
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.940 
and a web server
currently has the capability

150
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.300 
to handle maybe one hundred
requests per minute,

151
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.960 
then if I quickly need to scale
that up and suddenly see a

152
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.800 
thousand or tens of thousands of
transactions in the same time period,

153
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:37.670 
I need rapid elasticity or rapid scalability
to be able to quickly have those

154
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.390 
additional resources applied to
that specific challenge of

155
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.300 
handling web
server transactions.

156
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.490 
And ecosystem connectivity obviously a
base element of that

157
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.940 
is the broad
network access.

158
00:11:52.210 --> 00:12:00.160 
Now reality is that not every data
center not every IT infrastructure

159
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:07.560 
follows all of those cloud definitions of
NIST in minute detail. Reality is

160
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.580 
that there is a mix
of existing traditional infrastructure,

161
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.480 
that there are private clouds
that are may be built in

162
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.990 
specific data centers for specific
enterprises or customers or businesses

163
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:29.340 
and that there is a public cloud
space that can be further divided into

164
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.390 
dedicated elements or dedicated segments
of that public cloud.

165
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:39.510 
Now if you look at the numbers here,
you clearly see that although the traditional IT

166
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.750 
is declining nine percent year
over year, it is still

167
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:51.530 
a major or the major part of
the market today. So the traditional IT

168
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.880 
is and will stay around for quite
a number of years. Now the more

169
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.670 
quickly growing elements of the marketplace
of the IT marketplace, IT services marketplace

170
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.330 
are public clouds but even to a
larger extent the public clouds and the

171
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.350 
dedicated elements of
the public clouds.

172
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.680 
Now considering
that reality,

173
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.770 
that we have
the different

174
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.710 
target areas, traditional IT public
dedicated as well as private,

175
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.060 
the challenge now becomes how do I
manage the collection of all of these.

176
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.770 
It is not as easy as saying
I deploy my complete business in

177
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.740 
one or the other. The reality
is that most businesses, especially

178
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.490 
large businesses and enterprises not only
use one or two but

179
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.840 
all of these different
elements of cloud together.

180
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.590 
Which of course raises a couple
of challenges. One of them is

181
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.880 
how do I move an application
or workload from one of those

182
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.930 
landing stones to
another landing stone.

183
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.780 
How do I connect the
different landing stones together?

184
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:04.810 
It might be relatively easy to
have the same logic deployed

185
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.880 
on one cloud and on another cloud.
However it is a lot more

186
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.720 
effort to also move data from
one of these elements to another

187
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.450 
element and to move the
data between the clouds.

188
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.470 
And of course the third challenge
is the consistency of management.

189
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:25.410 
How do I ensure that from a security
posture I have the same level of

190
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.690 
visibility to my workload no
matter where in these different

191
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.310 
landing zones it runs. How do I
ensure that from an availability perspective,

192
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:39.710 
I have the same set of transparency
have the availability and the same capabilities

193
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.750 
for having resiliency and fail over
and maybe even capabilities

194
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.480 
to recover from disasters when I
look when I look at workload

195
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.790 
that is deployed across
those different clouds.

196
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.460 
Coming back to
the statement of

197
00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.370 
reality is that we do have a
mix today and reality is that

198
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.250 
this mix will stay
around for some time.

199
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.320 
Then we have to realize that maybe
only twenty percent of the workload

200
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.640 
is deployed into the
clouds today. Eighty percent

201
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.610 
the majority of workload anyway
is still deployed on traditional

202
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.130 
workloads. Over the next ten years we
will have the reality of a mix.

203
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.870 
Now what does that mix in IT
infrastructure mean for you as

204
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.720 
you develop application, what does it
mean for you as you

205
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:37.160 
maybe consult from an idea
strategy and idea architecture perspective,

206
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:42.610 
what does it mean for you as
you maybe fill roles in operation and

207
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.840 
deploy and run elements of some
of the workload or what would

208
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.230 
that mix mean for you as
you govern and optimize environments

209
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.280 
that run workload?

210
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.610 
Well, let's drill deeper into
some of the traditional approach

211
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:08.050 
to management of IT based for example
on the ITIL standards that defined

212
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:13.780 
processes, methods and roles
in organizations, to ensure

213
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.780 
proper change management,
proper release management,

214
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.740 
proper incident management, when it
comes to problems and incident,

215
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.550 
proper monitoring
of environments,

216
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.010 
proper service request handling as
well as proper security

217
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:37.620 
management and compliance management. Now
while while those service disciplines

218
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:43.120 
were clearly structured and clearly
defined with methods to ensure

219
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.780 
that these would be
transparent and documented

220
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.890 
and had a certain
structure around them,

221
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:56.130 
they also meant that they provided
quite a strict and sometimes also

222
00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:01.010 
quite costly process that required
a lot of effort, required

223
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.650 
a lot of time
and was very inflexible.

224
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.520 
Some of these characteristics directly
collide with the requests

225
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.730 
we had from the businesses to
be more flexible, to scale rapidly,

226
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.190 
to quickly address new
demands in the marketplace.

227
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:23.270 
So that's when some of the
new approaches to handling for example

228
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:28.330 
the deployment of new versions or
new releases of applications came out.

229
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.930 
The keyword there is
DevOps which

230
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.500 
quickly builds a pipeline, going
from thinking about new ideas

231
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.610 
capabilities to quickly coding
them, delivering them running

232
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:47.120 
them and then being able to manage and
then again tying it back learning from

233
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.100 
values out of those changes and
maybe identify improvements or maybe

234
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.150 
identify elements that want to be
removed from the code.

235
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.960 
Now all that requires

236
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.580 
still some discipline

237
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:10.070 
over to elements of security, compliance,
availability, problem and incident management.

238
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.050 
How do those two worlds come
together? Well, the only way they

239
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:20.250 
come together is if we define
shared responsibility. And that's especially true

240
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:28.460 
if we not only have a single
provider namely an in-house IT department

241
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.120 
but if we start to have
a multiplicity of clouds and different

242
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.320 
elements of clouds.

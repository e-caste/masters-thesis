In this video I'm going
to prototype an idea.

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.660 
So the idea that I'm going to
prototype is called 'Sports Buddy'

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.940 
app and it's an application
that will motivate people by

4
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.550 
helping them to partner up
with their friends and to

5
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.440 
do sports. So it uses peer pressure
and sends push notifications

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.810 
to both parties and motivates them
to go and do sports. So I'm

7
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:55.170 
going to prototype it using the simple
material that I have around me.

8
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.570 


9
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.550 


10
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:17.230 


11
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.150 
So this is the prototype I've built, and
next week you will see how we test it!

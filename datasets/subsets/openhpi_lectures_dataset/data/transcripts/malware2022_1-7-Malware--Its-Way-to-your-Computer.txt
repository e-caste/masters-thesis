00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.050 
In our openHPI course about
Cyberthreats by Malware,

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.060 
we now want to discuss how malware
finds its way to your computer.

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.520 
We already mentioned malware is the
central attack vector in the internet.

4
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.860 
It is one of the central
weapons of the cybercriminals.

5
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:32.350 
The devices of users, the computer systems
they could be a potential target

6
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.410 
for malware. So
with malware,

7
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.040 
the end user systems can be infected, with
malware all the service providers

8
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.780 
systems can be infected.
So potentially home computers

9
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.780 
are more vulnerable to malware attacks over
the internet because typically the protection

10
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
is less than with professional
service providers.

11
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.420 
So malware are especially
easy to use for attacks.

12
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.960 
So a malware offers a wide
range of functionalities

13
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.700 
and unlimited possibilities
for attacks

14
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.010 
when the attacker
manages to

15
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.500 
install such malware on the
computer systems of the users,

16
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.090 
on the devices of the users
then they have an easy

17
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.300 
game to do their
better work.

18
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.980 
So what they want to use by such attacks?
They want to misuse computing power

19
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.990 
they want to utilize computing power
for their own purposes, typically

20
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.780 
criminal and bad purposes. They
want to do data destruction -

21
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.280 
data theft, data
manipulation.

22
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.050 
They want to destruct
entire computer systems.

23
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.310 
They want to send and

24
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.350 
show advertisements to earn
money for doing this.

25
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.820 
They often create
fear in the user

26
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.310 
and then they misuse this
fear for their purpose.

27
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.970 
We will see this in more detail. To send
blackmail, to perform espionage,

28
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.480 
many other activities are
performed by means of malware.

29
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.220 
Now the question is how the
malware here from the hacker

30
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.650 
comes over the internet to
the system of the users.

31
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.240 
So the cybercriminals
first they developed the malware.

32
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.890 
They developed the malware to infect
the victim systems. There is a large

33
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.680 
library of such malwares, often
malware is adapted to a certain

34
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.140 
purpose, to a certain attack
process. So the cyber criminal

35
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.270 
prepares such a malware and then
they send it as they try to

36
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.970 
get it installed on the user
systems. So one way, for example, is

37
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.090 
that the cyber
criminals

38
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.930 
inject the malware to a medium, for
example to such an application an email

39
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
or a website or others and then in
case of email, send this email

40
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.920 
over the internet
to the

41
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.310 
user and when
the victim

42
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.120 
accesses a medium, for
example to open

43
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.160 
the email and to open the
attachment of the email,

44
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.640 
then the malware which
is hidden in that

45
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.390 
attachment is installing itself
in the victim's computer system.

46
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.490 
The victim - the user doesn't
become aware of that.

47
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.790 
So at the end his system or certain
programs or applications are infected.

48
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.970 
The user is not aware of that. The user
uses the systems, uses the applications

49
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.730 
and then the malware
can do its bad work.

50
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.560 
So the attack vector of such
malware attacks is in general

51
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.160 
that the malware need to be installed
on the computer systems of the victim.

52
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.370 
There are different
possibilities to do this.

53
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.720 
The human factor, social engineering
methods to convince the user

54
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.090 
to do for some
good reason

55
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.020 
installing the software,

56
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.640 
or technical factors technical
failures can be misused

57
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.220 
so that the malware is
installed at the user's system.

58
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.880 
And then it becomes
easy for the attacker.

59
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.990 
So the attack here is how
to get the malware

60
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.120 
installed on the user system. Let's discuss
this attack vector human - the user.

61
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:32.630 
So often a victim's lack of attention is
enough to get a malware installed

62
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.740 
on his or her
computer system.

63
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.910 
So the malware could also be injected
into the computer system

64
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.280 
by social engineering.
For example

65
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.950 
promising the user to
install some important

66
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.090 
program the user wants to have and
misusing this also to install then

67
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.830 
malware beside of
the software.

68
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.870 
So examples, I already
mentioned this, open an email

69
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.760 
an email with a malicious attachment or
downloading something from the internet,

70
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.640 
for example a new
application or

71
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.490 
special information or a game

72
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.640 
or something like that and then
after opening that

73
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.680 
system which was infected by
malware, then malware is installed

74
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.060 
on the side of the user. So if we
look at some statistics, then

75
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.520 
it's about half and half
that people open an

76
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.460 
unknown attachment
or application.

77
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.010 
About a half doesn't
do this.

78
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:59.780 
So here we see almost a half which opens
such unknown attachments for curiosity

79
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.970 
or carelessness or
negligence or others.

80
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.790 
So this is then the
attacker have one.

81
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.700 
This way as soon as a

82
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.410 
user opens his
attachment the malware

83
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.660 
will be
installed on his system.

84
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.580 
Also the promise here in internet you
can install some helpful software

85
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.790 
to clean your system or even
to find out whether

86
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.420 
there is malware on your
system. Often such systems

87
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.890 
that are available in
the internet are

88
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:46.140 
infected with malware. Malware is
hidden in that

89
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.460 
programs and the user that wants
to have this functionality

90
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.490 
on his system is installing is
downloading that system and then

91
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.490 
he or she also downloads the
malware hidden in that system.

92
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:07.100 
Another way to your computer is
to misuse USB sticks.

93
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.990 
So connecting a foreign USB
stick which was in fact, in which

94
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.290 
a malware was installed,
and in the moment the

95
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.340 
USB stick is
connected and the data

96
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.030 
explorer is used
to see what is

97
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.010 
stored on this USB stick, then in that
system the malware already infects

98
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:43.760 
the computer. And then public
WiFi networks are a way to

99
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.760 
bring systems

100
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.880 
malware to your computer.
We will discuss

101
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.670 
certain points when we speak about
different types of malware

102
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.690 
even in more detail.
Here in the general,

103
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.860 
after the attack vector human, I want
to also mention the attack vector

104
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.550 
technical. Technical is that, malware
could, in fact the computer system

105
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.740 
without any user
interaction.

106
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:22.240 
So this is more difficult for the
cybercriminals. They exploit

107
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.620 
available vulnerabilities in the system
of the victim in the system

108
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.820 
they want to target and then if they
see that there are inadequate

109
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.490 
security protection measures or that
there are some failures in the

110
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.160 
configuration, then
they find a way to

111
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.460 
bring, to install
their malware.

112
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.360 
In the same network, if sometimes a
computer gets infected in the network

113
00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:01.220 
then it's also highly probably that
also other computers in that network

114
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.670 
get infected without any
kind of interaction.

115
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:13.750 
So it's really dangerous - this
malware and the attack vector is

116
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.930 
for the cybercriminals
how to get the malware

117
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.080 
installed at the
user's system.

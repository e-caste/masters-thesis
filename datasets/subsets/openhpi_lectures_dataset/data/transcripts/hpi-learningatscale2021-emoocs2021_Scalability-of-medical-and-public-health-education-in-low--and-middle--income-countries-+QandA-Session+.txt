1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.579 
I'll now open the floor for any

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.740 
questions, comments,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.320 
and really welcome you to

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.921 
also contribute from your area of work,

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.904 
if you are doing if you have similar

6
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.529 
findings or any findings from the low

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.940 
and middle-income countries, it's very

8
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.409 
interesting to hear.

9
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.517 
I'm joined here by my colleague,

10
00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.680 
Ngouille, who is behind all the data.

11
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.979 
All the findings in this presentation

12
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.050 
is produced, by Ngouille, who's

13
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.550 
our data expert.

14
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.649 
So I'll open the floor if there are any

15
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.949 
interventions that the

16
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.700 
participants want to make.

17
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
Yes, Patrice, go ahead.

18
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.750 
Hello, everyone, thank you

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.999 
for the session.

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.539 
I am here as a

21
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.540 
private person that

22
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.049 
is interested in

23
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.390 
helping people from

24
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.889 
my country

25
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.509 
I am coming from Burkina Faso.

26
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.219 
I would like to know how

27
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.650 
someone from

28
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.845 
this country can directly

29
00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.067 
participate.

30
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.010 
First question and

31
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.709 
second question.

32
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.830 
Yes, I

33
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.860 
am active here

34
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.459 
in Germany as

35
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.370 
an I.T.

36
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.080 
professional.

37
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.610 
And I would like to

38
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.409 
set up some kind of

39
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.360 
MOOCs or

40
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.891 
participate in the deployment

41
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.660 
of a MOOC in the country

42
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.189 
where I am coming from.

43
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.049 
Yes, it will be very

44
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.909 
nice if I can

45
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.729 
have help as

46
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.380 
a private person

47
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.110 
and in a

48
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.250 
non-profit way.

49
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400 
Yes, thank you.

50
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.120 
Thanks so much, Patrice.

51
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.689 
Yeah, so currently we are servicing

52
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.356 
the whole world, all the materials

53
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.770 
that we have are also relevant

54
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.325 
for Burkina Faso, such as the Ebola

55
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.379 
and COVID-19, of course, but

56
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.389 
many other topics, measles and

57
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.789 
others are all open sources

58
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.917 
available for everyone.

59
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.059 
Sowe would always direct

60
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.479 
participants on online learning, just

61
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.499 
doing any course they wish.

62
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.357 
But then at the same time, we are

63
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.870 
producing country-led resources.

64
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.178 
And I perhaps hand over to Ngouille

65
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.179 
who's developing

66
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.879 
viral haemorrhagic fever related

67
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.595 
materials together with our country

68
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.180 
office in Burkina Faso.

69
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.789 
So a couple of words of the process

70
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.750 
and how they set courses for specialised

71
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.830 
infectious diseases are

72
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.620 
produced on the platform.

73
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.870 
Over to you Ngouille.

74
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.841 
Thank you so much, Heini, and thank you

75
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.319 
so much for your question.

76
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.673 
Just to follow up with what Heini had

77
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.879 
said. We also indeed

78
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.229 
develop country-specific

79
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.680 
content, and it's really a collaborative

80
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.210 
process with the country.

81
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.879 
Currently, we are on a project

82
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.290 
with Burkina Faso,

83
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.169 
on viral haemorrhagic fever training.

84
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.779 
And this is really, as I mentioned,

85
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.849 
a collaborative

86
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.979 
process with many entities

87
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.569 
involved.

88
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.893 
And it's with universities.

89
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.349 
And as Heini said, it's really technical

90
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.219 
content.

91
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.300 
So it takes

92
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.599 
various rounds and it has to comply

93
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.300 
with our own OpenWHO standards.

94
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.669 
And this is actually a long process.

95
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.751 
When people or entities reach

96
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.379 
out, we really work together

97
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.699 
in order to produce the courses.

98
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.939 
So this is

99
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.868 
really valid for all the content

100
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.310 
we put out on the platform.

101
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.264 
And just to refer back to your first

102
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.702 
question, we have many, many

103
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520 
topics.

104
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.819 
We have 100 topics available

105
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.820 
on the platform

106
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.100 
across 44 languages.

107
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.419 
And this is really open access.

108
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.862 
So anywhere in the world and

109
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.600 
we really focus on

110
00:04:20.835 --> 00:04:22.746 
accessibility. So anywhere in the world

111
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.810 
from Burkina (Africa), Indonesia,

112
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.940 
people can access the course

113
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.660 
and it's free.

114
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.999 
And yeah.

115
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.100 
To go back to your second question,

116
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.559 
we need to develop a course on

117
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.890 
OpenWHO.

118
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.399 
It really based on

119
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.529 
WHO content and

120
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.589 
really in a collaborative manner we

121
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.590 
develop the course.

122
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.709 
Many of the colleagues like yourself, if

123
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.019 
they speak the national or local

124
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.339 
language, we've also

125
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.130 
collaborated with many volunteers

126
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.379 
to translate into these national and

127
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.269 
local languages. So that's always a

128
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.459 
possibility to work

129
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.319 
with us while we cannot produce

130
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.574 
content outside of the WHO's

131
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.100 
expertise or evidence-based

132
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.279 
materials, and we can then

133
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.126 
multiply the learning by providing

134
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.779 
it into the languages of

135
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.399 
the populations.

136
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.282 
So we've done this work a lot with the

137
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.209 
Democratic Republic of Congo,

138
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.361 
where we produced materials in Lingala,

139
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.838 
Congolese, Swahili and

140
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.039 
many other languages.

141
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.455 
We have cholera materials

142
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.970 
in Hausa and others.

143
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.079 
So we're trying to see

144
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.893 
how we can best reach the populations

145
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.390 
in the right

146
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.709 
languages. So this is something that we

147
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.327 
are always looking for volunteers

148
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.800 
to help us.

149
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.480 
So that's been the crowd power

150
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.727 
we've had over the past couple of

151
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.180 
years.

152
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.010 
Many thanks.

153
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.910 
Anybody else just to say

154
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.691 
I hope these conference proceedings will

155
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.919 
capture some of the very similar

156
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.959 
findings all of us have made on

157
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.369 
our platforms. And I was really

158
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.529 
delighted to listen yesterday

159
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.000 
on Coursera presentation where

160
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.402 
they, for instance, had seen a similar

161
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.639 
increase of women participating

162
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.649 
in online learning, as we have

163
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.959 
actually witnessed on OpenWHO.

164
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.689 
So I think the pandemic has also

165
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.307 
positively changed the attendance

166
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.489 
of some groups

167
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.110 
like women that have gone from

168
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.839 
40 percent to now currently

169
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.359 
50+ percent of learners

170
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.609 
on OpenWHO and the same

171
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.769 
many changes on the low

172
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.209 
and middle-income country

173
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.234 
enrolments that we are yet

174
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.146 
to depict and understand

175
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.740 
and analyse in more details.

176
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.709 
But these all are actually quite

177
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.119 
interesting findings that the learning

178
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.800 
providers such as ourselves

179
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.829 
and other platforms have witnessed

180
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.910 
over the pandemic.

181
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.472 
Martin, is there, over to you.

182
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.810 
I have a question on the marketing

183
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.903 
ways of OpenWHO,

184
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.949 
do you know how

185
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.501 
participants in these low-income

186
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.644 
countries find the courses?

187
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.019 
Because I'm always

188
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.659 
a little bit confused about the

189
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.443 
marketing race in those countries.

190
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.470 
I think Messenger play a big role, for

191
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.810 
example.

192
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.112 
Do you have any insights there?

193
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.572 
Yes, we have great data that

194
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.026 
we need to remind ourselves on the

195
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.230 
channels that people access the

196
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.819 
learning, but for instance, for the

197
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.069 
African Francophone users,

198
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.197 
we noted earlier during

199
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.209 
the Ebola time that many of them

200
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.519 
came through the US National

201
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.040 
Library of Medicine link.

202
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.649 
So there was a link on the French

203
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.910 
page of the U.S.

204
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.790 
National Medical Library.

205
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.629 
And this was the main avenue where

206
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.904 
people not typing directly

207
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.459 
OpenWHO on the platform would access,

208
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.609 
then for our African

209
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.325 
integrated disease surveillance and

210
00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.499 
response courses.

211
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.799 
It is true that there is a massive

212
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800 
5000 people Telegram

213
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.220 
group. I don't even have Telegram.

214
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.359 
I don't know what it is.

215
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.758 
So, the Telegram group

216
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.438 
for us, for the African diseases

217
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.049 
is a very important

218
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.799 
avenue and channelled it to bring

219
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.819 
people to the platform.

220
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.019 
And we've done this.

221
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.439 
Ngouille, do you have more better memory

222
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.149 
than I have on any of the channels, like

223
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.865 
how do people access and what about

224
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.300 
these channels? Over to you.

225
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.450 
So as you said, we've done this work

226
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.481 
previously with the Ebola courses where

227
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.889 
we really made like a research

228
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.359 
on how they access it.

229
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.369 
And this is something to be done,

230
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.769 
perhaps more with our COVID-19

231
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.019 
topics and our area definitely

232
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.020 
to explore.

233
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.169 
But as Heini said, so

234
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.570 
it's a little bit a case by case

235
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.740 
scenario.

236
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.039 
So this idea is, of course,

237
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.320 
there's a large network where this

238
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.169 
course is promoted, but for other

239
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.120 
courses then we actually

240
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.369 
noticed some links

241
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.309 
that are more popular.

242
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.940 
But this is definitely an area

243
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.817 
that we should dig into

244
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.459 
to really identify where

245
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.560 
these LMIC countries

246
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.720 
mainly access it and

247
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.690 
that pattern would really help in

248
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.956 
really identifying where

249
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.529 
they come from and how to perhaps

250
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.902 
address barriers in terms of

251
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.489 
access to increase the use.

252
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.145 
And that having said WHO,

253
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.440 
as the World Health Organisation, we

254
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.249 
cannot do any

255
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.257 
marketing in the useful channels,

256
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.929 
we go through the countries'

257
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.039 
country offices.

258
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.549 
So it's more like practitioners sharing

259
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.506 
their links and contents.

260
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.299 
We don't do, we cannot do any paid

261
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.499 
marketing. So we are a little bit

262
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.620 
limited in that we are just

263
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.305 
hoping for people to find

264
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.559 
this information. And one of the key

265
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.049 
places where people access

266
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.799 
from is the WHO website.

267
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.539 
So each infectious disease, we currently

268
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.059 
host materials for 20

269
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.285 
different diseases across

270
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.883 
the board, from diphtheria to cholera

271
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.149 
to COVID-19 to plague.

272
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.959 
So the WHO website has actually

273
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.059 
had millions of visitors every day.

274
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.533 
And links in those infectious disease

275
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.400 
pages actually bring quite a lot of

276
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.782 
users. But yeah, this is an area where

277
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.879 
we definitely need to with these figures

278
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.169 
and numbers at the entry

279
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.080 
of the platform. We are also interested

280
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.290 
in capturing ourselves.

281
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.979 
While the colleagues Dr Titi

282
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.619 
from Indonesia, it's quite late

283
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.809 
hours, and for Dr

284
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.427 
Matthew, it's early morning, very

285
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120 
early morning in

286
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.370 
the US, in the

287
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.480 
West Coast.

288
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.449 
They've actually not able to join this

289
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.609 
time, but they're the three of us given

290
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.649 
we all had very similar findings and

291
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.512 
all the three organisations, we have a

292
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.369 
willingness to go from

293
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.554 
not only self-paced learning, but go

294
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.940 
to the next formats.

295
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.029 
Go to the more hybrid, virtually

296
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.549 
engaging learning programmes

297
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.679 
where you have more blended learning

298
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.359 
formats. There's actually quite a lot of

299
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.124 
work that we want to do based on the

300
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.230 
findings we have in the low

301
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.102 
and middle-income countries and see how

302
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.879 
we can re-engage, reactivate,

303
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.429 
engage with the learning retention

304
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.379 
for online performance and build,

305
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.779 
like Dr Titi here mentioned, the full

306
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.909 
competency-based learning programmes

307
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.070 
that can run online.

308
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.893 
And this was also one of the Coursera

309
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.190 
findings from yesterday where they run

310
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.499 
IT related learning programmes

311
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.499 
from the scratch, no prior experience

312
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.608 
degree programme that runs fully

313
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.389 
online. So really massive

314
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.190 
learning programmes. I know they've

315
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.070 
been there before the pandemic, but

316
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.179 
latest by the pandemic, I think the

317
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.438 
magnitude of such training programmes

318
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.659 
are expanding vastly.

319
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.619 
And I think for us who are providing

320
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.850 
medical and public health

321
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.759 
training resources, we are also

322
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.903 
in our own team, in the learning team

323
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.959 
of the Health Emergencies programme, we

324
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.399 
are looking into the ways how, for

325
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.649 
instance, for Burkina Faso, the viral

326
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.779 
haemorrhagic fevers programme can

327
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.779 
match this online,

328
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.669 
the face to face, the simulation

329
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.709 
and the on-site training in the clinical

330
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.299 
setting. So it's the whole training

331
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.369 
curriculum that carries across

332
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.589 
all these elements and

333
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.809 
requires the professional to attend them

334
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.574 
all. While we are not the certifying

335
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.214 
body, we can still provide

336
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.719 
the knowledge and skills elements

337
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.179 
for the health emergency workforce.

338
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.917 
And this is the kind of challenge

339
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.478 
that actually all the SEARAME,

340
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.169 
Stanford and ourselves in

341
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.970 
OpenWHO team all have

342
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.102 
concluded in the previous discussions.

343
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.259 
We have a very similar need

344
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.807 
to try and convey learning to the

345
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.059 
frontline and we are trying to

346
00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.249 
see how better improve this work.

347
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.049 
And this is an invitation to everyone

348
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.210 
who has good ideas to join this work.

349
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.626 
And we've already we are

350
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.559 
receiving huge support from the

351
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.350 
HPI team who is providing practical

352
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.089 
ways for us.

353
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.160 
Also, evidence from the research that

354
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.675 
HPI students and doctoral

355
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.559 
students and the PhD

356
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.159 
already teachers

357
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.499 
actually have witnessed from

358
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.500 
the use.

359
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.169 
And this has been critical for us to

360
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.150 
also successfully go into these

361
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.579 
massive figures on our learning

362
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.289 
intervention for the pandemic.

363
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.185 
But there is more chapters to come.

364
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.092 
I think the long nativity of

365
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.009 
the learning programmes online,

366
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.400 
this is only the beginning for it.

367
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.038 
And there's a lot of need to see

368
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.549 
how we best can maximise the

369
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.679 
reach and access for those who

370
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.870 
have connectivity issues, have

371
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.470 
Internet

372
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.629 
and need to

373
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.059 
be able to produce materials in the

374
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.279 
formats that that suit the learners.

375
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.649 
And this is not only learners of my age,

376
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.359 
but also the younger generation who

377
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.889 
learns very differently to what,

378
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.610 
for instance, I've learnt.

379
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.690 
So this is just to say that the

380
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.429 
findings are here for now and today.

381
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.430 
We will be very

382
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.869 
pleased to join the next session

383
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.789 
probably one year from now and see

384
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.159 
how we've progressed in

385
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.532 
different areas of the work.

386
00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:25.539 
Hendrik?

387
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.989 
Yeah, if I may just

388
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.510 
my synapses just triggered a question

389
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.269 
regarding your data and maybe

390
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.669 
you can deep dive a little bit more into

391
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.659 
those constraints.

392
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.473 
You already said, like, when it comes

393
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.590 
to electricity and

394
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.489 
network constraints,

395
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.009 
so to speak. And in combination

396
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.880 
with that kind of

397
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.119 
these kinds of constraints, I have the

398
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.031 
question, is it when it comes to mobile

399
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.719 
learning, I'm always wondering, is it

400
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.789 
rather anywhere?

401
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.830 
So I want to take a look

402
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.110 
in the bus or at home,

403
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200 
at the office. Is it

404
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.684 
anyhow, tablet, phone?

405
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.889 
And if you can see that in the

406
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:08.968 
data, because my point

407
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.210 
so far is that people still

408
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.950 
sit at one desk

409
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.649 
at one place where they can focus

410
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.929 
and then they go and mingle and

411
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.059 
ask and all the social aspect.

412
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.491 
I know it's a pretty nitty-gritty

413
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.289 
enquiry right now. I'm just curious if

414
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.399 
you have any insights on constraints

415
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.049 
and mobile learning in that regard.

416
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.620 
Thank you. Thank you so much, Hendrik.

417
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.770 
That's actually an excellent question

418
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.909 
and in the context of

419
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.250 
LMIC, that's really a great question.

420
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.039 
So Heini mentioned quickly

421
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.310 
the multipliers.

422
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.063 
So in the platform, in the OpenWHO

423
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.769 
platform, we always make

424
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.349 
available of the content

425
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.722 
downloadable, so for offline

426
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.795 
use. So that is something

427
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.700 
quantifiable.

428
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.539 
People can download the videos, they can

429
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.239 
download the documents, the transcripts,

430
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.199 
the slides.

431
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.299 
So this can be taken to another

432
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.427 
classroom or as some we

433
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.769 
have some people from the fields

434
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.150 
who actually said that they

435
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.849 
would download the materials and

436
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.009 
translate it in a local language and

437
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.090 
then for a wider dissemination.

438
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.090 
So that's one way to go about it.

439
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.580 
Also on the platform, we can

440
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.851 
actually measure whether the course was

441
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.490 
accessed by desktop or by mobile.

442
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.210 
So roughly 50-50

443
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.759 
for some courses.

444
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.259 
So it gives us an

445
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.485 
idea of how they accessed

446
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.369 
the course. We also have an app

447
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.835 
for the OpenWHO platform.

448
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.410 
People can access the content and

449
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.750 
courses through the app.

450
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.960 
So really, in terms of how

451
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.749 
they accessed it, it's really

452
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.179 
depending on their needs and

453
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.080 
whatever is easier for them.

454
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.409 
But we always make sure that

455
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.720 
our courses are built and designed

456
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.489 
in a way that would suit

457
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.519 
their preferred format of accessing

458
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.890 
the learning materials.

459
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.459 
And that's why when we developed the

460
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.529 
course, we really insist on our

461
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.029 
OpenWHO standards.

462
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.429 
For it not to be too complex, even

463
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.559 
if there is an animation would be

464
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.200 
preferred. We always think of the mobile

465
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.230 
access of it.

466
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.439 
So it's really that's why

467
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.180 
we have a very, very

468
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.489 
huge focus on accessibility, because

469
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.139 
we know that the bandwidth aren't the

470
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.179 
same, isn't the same everywhere

471
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.258 
in the world, and each

472
00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.937 
format and each course is really

473
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.999 
developed to suit

474
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.330 
any context.

475
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.289 
And yeah, so

476
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.460 
to answer the question

477
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.520 
at this moment, we're able to

478
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.366 
quantify whether it is accessed by

479
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.259 
mobile or desktop.

480
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.909 
So usually it's a 50-50

481
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.839 
depending on the course.

482
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.799 
And in terms of format,

483
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.359 
people can download for offline use

484
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.510 
mainly even if the

485
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.760 
content is mainly video-based.

486
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.249 
We have transcripts and slides

487
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.739 
and every course material available

488
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.140 
for offline use as well.

489
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.070 
Thanks for the insights.

490
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.069 
Sure, sure. It was a fairly

491
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.079 
it was an unfair one.

492
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.549 
So thank you.

493
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.750 
OK.

494
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.490 
OK, unless other

495
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.090 
interventions, I think we are

496
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.859 
probably with the videos already

497
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.079 
providing such a great

498
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.720 
background and hoping this comes

499
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.160 
available also for other users,

500
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.460 
later on, we

501
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.695 
really think HPI and this

502
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.489 
conference organisers for putting this

503
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.619 
session together, Martin for

504
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.509 
providing the video is excellent.

505
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.390 
And the Hendrik for

506
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.640 
hosting it for us.

507
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.019 
So we've got

508
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.849 
space to also

509
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.279 
dig into more of the findings and

510
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.093 
probably publish more that we've been

511
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.460 
doing this work together with HPI

512
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.059 
in the past years and continue to do

513
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.459 
so. So also to quantify

514
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.900 
the work and publish it

515
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.630 
so that it can be also

516
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.204 
informed to the rest of the world in

517
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.829 
their online learning work that we've

518
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.830 
done.

519
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.349 
So really lovely

520
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.062 
to have had this session hoping

521
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.789 
everybody enjoys the rest of the

522
00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.199 
conference. There are a few sessions

523
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.809 
still to come and I

524
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.400 
guess we are good to go with

525
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.950 
these few exchanges here.

526
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.049 
Thanks also Ngouille for having joined

527
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.880 
and produced all of our findings.

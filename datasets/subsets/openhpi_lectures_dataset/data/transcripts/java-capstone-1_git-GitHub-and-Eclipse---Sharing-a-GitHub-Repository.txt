WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.450 
actually repository
once more

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.460 
so what we want to do now
is we want to clone

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.640 
the are the get repository
from from get up to

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.730 
all ok machine so that
can work locally

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.070 
and in order to do that we just
click on the green but here

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.100 
and we can copy the u l
here and then we can

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.670 
go to the command

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.540 
first thing we need to do
here is we need to switch

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.530 
to the repository to do the
directory where we want to have

10
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.120 
to repository and
this is actually

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.940 
workspace eclipse workspace so
i we already did that and now

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.790 
we say gave no no

13
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.440 
case the url that we just
copied from from the

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.130 
get a page and
say return and

15
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.300 
it will clone repository
to workspace and now we

16
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.880 
did it already did was was
much faster than you who

17
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.670 
had on the slow so
we need to go

18
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.190 
to the clips not eclipse
now we already open that

19
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.880 
i'm trying to speed up
years you notice many

20
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.200 
and we say we want to have a
huge our project and then you

21
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.360 
to our project will be
called kept don't want

22
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
and i'm going to slow it
down because this is

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.950 
important what you're doing here
is we're naming the job project

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.810 
the same way we named or repository
that will lead to the fact

25
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.650 
that eclipse will just
create a photo or noticed

26
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.250 
the order is already
there and it would

27
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.900 
then just create all the files
which we need for that java

28
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.070 
project inside the existing for
which is all good repository

29
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.900 
so if we just click
finish now yeah

30
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.990 
we have travel project
now in here and you

31
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.710 
can see the redoing means already
that and maybe you already

32
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.790 
noticed that there was
some kind of with

33
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.510 
symbols things and
that means eclipse

34
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.650 
also notice that this
repository of this

35
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.150 
directory is good because
of that so you could use

36
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.220 
the builders support for good
in eclipse from now on

37
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.450 
actually we don't really like
that so all we rather used to

38
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.770 
command for that so let's have a
look want to the command-line

39
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.280 
what happened there so that what
happened in our different

40
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.430 
for the two or we

41
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.830 
want to do a status not
repository yet of

42
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.250 
course we need to go into repository
for so now we're in the

43
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.360 
workspace we need to go to
the directory so c d e

44
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.180 
one of those you can see
you can use it had to

45
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.090 
our complete those were not so
familiar with the command i'm

46
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.050 
very slow in type
i mean and then

47
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.630 
get status again get status get
actually you know you have

48
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.820 
to type that again you could
also use something else which

49
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.980 
i will show you next
time so we can

50
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
see there's a couple
files here which are

51
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.720 
are rare and that means
it kind of doesn't

52
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.680 
know them yet so they they
are there it sees them

53
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.410 
but they're not added
to the stage here

54
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.560 
so we do that so we set
it at now we can either

55
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.980 
do that for each of the
files or we can do it just

56
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.270 
for all and this is not just
thought and it's as at all of

57
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.240 
these finds we do that

58
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.530 
we can do it says again

59
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.620 
using just the arrow up which
says give me they would command

60
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.890 
that it says that you're
kind of with that

61
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.140 
it's green they were at their
wedding but they're not permitted

62
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.640 
yet so before we can read
this isn't the real

63
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.980 
so this is a project
already but i want a far

64
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.140 
and we need some
code there

65
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.210 
so vector it lets here we
have to source or maybe you

66
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.380 
saw that it doesn't have the photo
in there and this is because

67
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.910 
it doesn't at mt photos so
on let's have a new class

68
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.460 
were again mean
fly the main

69
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.270 
method and it says the use of
evil advantage is discouraged

70
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.020 
and we actually also to
discover that and this is

71
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.610 
why we say let's it
put it in a package

72
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.790 
you already know we either the
backwards you l thing in order

73
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.140 
to have unique identifiers
or package that we

74
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.850 
try to call it t e they
guy kept through

75
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.160 
finish that there is

76
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.210 
we have i have here and now let's
go back to the command-line

77
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.530 
to get started once
more and now we see

78
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.740 
the source code or as
also there abstract you

79
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.620 
know tracked and it also includes
all five such as holderness

80
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.140 
of that so random one

81
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.210 
status again and now we also see
the fires in the source for

82
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.630 
that we all the other
photos the packages

83
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.390 
and now on we can actually
committed so here

84
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.430 
and that's as message so
that's kind of shortcut

85
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.740 
we give the message
say in english

86
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.210 
we show him

87
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.440 
the input ok so now we have
all itself and is it on it

88
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.930 
no now it's not because we
just created a committee

89
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.590 
at this commit is locally
so we know that

90
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.260 
all there all the comments
will be on several

91
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.470 
yeah machines later on
to also take account

92
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.790 
capabilities it's
a distributed

93
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.200 
version control system and in order
to make it more less public

94
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.860 
to make it available
to the master or to

95
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.340 
get up in this case
which is the region

96
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.260 
all repository we have to push
it there so we've got to logan

97
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.390 
commit right now and we're
going to push this

98
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.810 
is the it push it would
have thought that

99
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.070 
and knows writing or the
objects and it's a as yet

100
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.940 
total ten objects pushed
from all local most

101
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.260 
to the remote last so that
we wrote one from it

102
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.370 
so let's have a
look at it no

103
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.900 
leaders you think
but if you refresh

104
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.260 
we can see we've got cast
at it ignore five of

105
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.530 
the project orders
so in the

106
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.670 
great project
i wanna had

107
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.100 
so what do you do know i
don't do anything not

108
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.980 
i do something i go to you it's
a hit hong and ran like you

109
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.000 
project could you please add me
as a collaborators so that

110
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.060 
i can probably work
together with you

111
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.700 
if i just wanted to see
what's in your project

112
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.640 
in there just want to check it
out i can do it without asking

113
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.410 
you because public so i can do
that but let's say i want to

114
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.750 
really work with your
collaborate with you

115
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.920 
therefore i need you to have
the we are the possibility or

116
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.450 
the rights to push to your
repository or at least it would

117
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.730 
simplify techniques if so
how do we do that there

118
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.470 
is some but with things
we just settings

119
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.950 
and he we have the collaborators
that sounds like a good option

120
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.710 
for what what to do
and now we can at

121
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.100 
good users so i
could have user so

122
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.500 
it's what's your name r and
then more or less then

123
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.660 
so you know laws
allows it up

124
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.040 
for the story you can find all
sell it tall some you answer

125
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.650 
has taken i could have
and i will that causes

126
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.740 
a collaborator
brought now has to

127
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.890 
say well yes i want to
collaborate with you

128
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.350 
you also

129
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.700 
can and then i can also push
to your report to you

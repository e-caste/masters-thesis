1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.620 
now we consider security
protocols security protocols

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.550 
the to achieve served
to guarantee security

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.180 
objectives so partisans have
to follow different steps

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.210 
in such a distributed
information processing process

5
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.640 
a to ensures a specific
security requirements

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.650 
requirements like for
example out education

7
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.950 
so in out indication man so two
different steps have to be

8
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.950 
done by the centers and the
message to the receiver receive

9
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.240 
on suspect and at the end of ces
are distributed information

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.700 
process so both sides a can be
sure a about a out and about

11
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.640 
identity of the partner all
encryption they can be done hybrid

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.250 
approach in ditches signatures
this are all a security

13
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.900 
as this all security protocols
to achieve a certain goal

14
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.620 
when we define such as
security protocols

15
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.670 
then we have clearly to explain
clearly to say is that

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.060 
the aim of a security protocol
is not to secure the process

17
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
see aim of a security
protocols in a to ensure

18
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.430 
that the prescribed safety requirement
so as a security protocols

19
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.680 
helps to realize
one security go

20
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.960 
it's not one protocol to a it
to a is secure all kinds and

21
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.630 
to help to reach all
kinds of security calls

22
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.020 
unlike in the case of communication
protocols one cannot assume

23
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.670 
one cannot assume set security
protocols are used in the core

24
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.520 
eight way by all parties what's the
difference in a communication

25
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.150 
protocols of people want
to communicate as

26
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.890 
who does not want to
communicate with other

27
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.000 
we're not follows protocol
will start to lose

28
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.280 
in the security protocol to
reach a certain security will

29
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.280 
say our attack us for
example interested

30
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.430 
and not to reach to undergoes
a security protocol

31
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.840 
and if they find a way to apply
is a security protocol not

32
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.660 
in the right way to reach for
example access to data all to

33
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.780 
to fake something or
do other things

34
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.210 
and they were not follow
the steps say try

35
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
to misuse a protocol and the design
of such security protocols

36
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.440 
they need to be aware of set
duration so attacks on security

37
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.810 
protocols are aimed to leveraging
security protocol also encrypting

38
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.740 
method used by it in order
to achieve a one-sided

39
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.650 
advantage by cybercriminals sappho
one must ensure that a security

40
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.130 
protocol cannot be
misused without notice

41
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.630 
perhaps one cannot prevent
misuse but one needs to

42
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.080 
a it guarantee that if
it's meath used see a

43
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.520 
partner is informed about that
also part that the possibility

44
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.520 
to find out that it was misused if
you look falls on the requirements

45
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.200 
for security protocols
there is a variety

46
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.180 
for example it starts this
arrow tolerance a lot

47
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.150 
of runs that means so
even this faulty usage

48
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.340 
with or faulty
user inputs

49
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.280 
the protocol does not stop
but offers solutions

50
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
so it's not too easy to perform
a denial of service attack

51
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.720 
so is that the protocol does not
stop but a is a protocol even

52
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.190 
in cave of misuse should
show away what to do

53
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.780 
negotiating capacity a is this
is very important because in

54
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.210 
security a to reach
security goes for example

55
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.810 
in case an encryption there
are many different methods

56
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.490 
they are the same method with
different implementation with

57
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:22.440 
different healings so it needs
to a it is security protocols

58
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.800 
a need to provide see as the
feature sets the participants

59
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.590 
can negotiate can
negotiate to a create

60
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.630 
a what kind of parameters what
kind of keys what kind of

61
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.780 
a is we have been
procedures say apply a

62
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.720 
out of a variety of
difference a it offers

63
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.410 
minimum disclosure
is a nasa

64
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.750 
requirements are for
security protocols

65
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.250 
and it says that only the
most necessary information

66
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.670 
is disclosed

67
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.950 
all secrecy this is the property
is that even if an encryption

68
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.120 
key is cracked set anti data
traffic must not be a endangered

69
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.180 
there must be no possibility of
drawing conclusions from previously

70
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.910 
used session keys to the keys
and to the information

71
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.820 
that is encrypted nation that
and now so is this arm recall

72
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.680 
i am ends when is the designer
design that security protocols

73
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.910 
and on the other side what at
tax again security protocols

74
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.410 
the idea of a is the attack is a
hit different so some of attacks

75
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.300 
are a are aimed a to attack
security prop protocol itself

76
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.330 
but some of the attacks attack
not security protocol itself

77
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.710 
but they attack c involved for
example is involved encryption

78
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.120 
methods attacks do not attacks
a suit purity protocol itself

79
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.220 
to not attack c involved
in christian method

80
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.320 
but try to attack seeing
keys that are used

81
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.450 
when we consider attacks again
security protocols we have to

82
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.970 
distinguish between passive
attacks he has a take a follows

83
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.220 
the flow of communication and
tries to gain information out

84
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.630 
of set flow e he tries to gain
information about its content

85
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.800 
its participation the participants
for example by eavesdropping

86
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.600 
all by a traffic flow analysis
and the other group

87
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.810 
or some more dangerous
group of attacks

88
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.820 
are the active attacks here the
attacker intervenes in the

89
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.780 
protocol and tries to
change it in his favor

90
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.720 
for example is proving
injections awesome

91
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.010 
against passive attacks
there are no means

92
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.940 
protocols in the net is open and
active attacks one can see

93
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.770 
that there is someone trying some
a is some a is some activity

94
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.020 
e by which is the his security
goes that are protected

95
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:27.240 
by security protocol are undergone
here are some examples

96
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.420 
of dangerous attacks on
security protocols

97
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.630 
for example the replay attack
replay attacks the idea is

98
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.410 
to recall a message and resented
for example recalls package

99
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.620 
with a password and then sends a
possible to sit package with

100
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.710 
a possible to buy said
decorous and self

101
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.170 
spooling attacks we already
discussed a lot of such spoofing

102
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.930 
attacks which consists
a in the idea is

103
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:03.630 
to communicate under a false
identity to you use and service

104
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.820 
to use an application or a
under a false identity

105
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.800 
to get some it wantage also men
in the middle attack men in

106
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.710 
the middle attacks we
have a it discussed

107
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.790 
in various applications the
idea here is to get an

108
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.430 
unnoticed into position
in the communication

109
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.650 
between two communication
polytunnels hijacking attack

110
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.830 
also fire checking attack we're
he had seen some example

111
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:38.110 
side here is too high check and
already a establish communication

112
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.850 
link already established means
there walls an out indication

113
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.810 
phase phase which was
successfully a finished

114
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.040 
and then z a a a data are
communicated and now say attack

115
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.810 
tries to hide checks
that communication

116
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.540 
after out education so he can
get access to the data without

117
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.660 
without indication denial
of service attacks

118
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.950 
a is the idea to
interfering with a

119
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.350 
preventing communication
with a service

120
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.350 
to a in there is two
to reach the result

121
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.260 
that the service is no more able
to work in a correct way or

122
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.700 
even to break
down at all

123
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.940 
and a short look on some
security protocols

124
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.720 
i give some example first example
is a security protocols for

125
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:37.240 
encryption so z security object
if set a is you should be

126
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.570 
ensured by such encryption
security protocols is

127
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.900 
that the users one to ensure
the confidentiality

128
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.790 
of sent messages when they
are transported through

129
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.460 
an open and communication
channel here is the users are

130
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.860 
to run such a security
protocol for encryptions

131
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.670 
so user initially agree on a
common encryption system

132
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.900 
a is the user must be it
technically capital

133
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.890 
a capital to execute say algorithms
used in set encryption

134
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.480 
scheme as is and not needs to be able
to runs agonism for encryption

135
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:22.310 
and the receiver a needs to be
able to run the procedures

136
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.150 
are for decrypting the
message and here are

137
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:33.310 
the typical way as we said c a
security protocols in need to

138
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:38.230 
have nature to it a or a
negotiation a capability is

139
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.940 
that typically users
are able to a creed

140
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.540 
on the strongest i algorithms
for encryption and decryption

141
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.810 
that both can master

142
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.150 
this was that the users have to
agree on a common encryption

143
00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.710 
system but the users also have
to create a agree on a session

144
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.770 
key we discussed no one key and
the two key encryption it's

145
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.230 
a different ways for a
agreeing on such a session

146
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.940 
key and then if this is done the
encrypted communication can

147
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.600 
start so each message
that are gives the than

148
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.900 
the ones to send a in a
is encrypted with the a

149
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:29.130 
a a negotiated method and we see
a a it was is negotiated key

150
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.280 
and then see a a common this and
it's no more possible to see

151
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.140 
what sick output it's a
content of communication

152
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.160 
the sender and receiver
can exchange message in

153
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.410 
a secure way here is an example
of a security protocol

154
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:53.490 
c so cared dicha signature for
encryption we already discussed

155
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.210 
in other reduce ditches signatures
we will a explain in more

156
00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.700 
detail in z and next
video but here are

157
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.500 
a is the idea is to show
why a digital signature

158
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.250 
is a security protocol
as that a is alps to

159
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.650 
ensures the security
object of ensuring

160
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:20.020 
the i would tend to city of
san are have says center

161
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:26.090 
and integrity a of somesuch
here which is sent a it by

162
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:31.200 
this and the open open adverb so
his idea here of cystic signature

163
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.680 
is not to take careful
convergent ality

164
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.130 
it's not to two to encrypt
something he has the idea is to

165
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:46.350 
provide means that see a receiver
can check whether this message

166
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.760 
comes from his under a
a and a weather's the

167
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.980 
message comes in and faked
in and modified way

168
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.240 
security protocols works
roughly as follows

169
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.470 
the users agreed on a two
key encryption system

170
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.070 
he he procure key palace
both sides needs

171
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.730 
to applied such a two
key encryption system

172
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:19.260 
and a they ensure that they
are public keys released

173
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:25.630 
so everyone can access then
these then signs a message

174
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.440 
before sending sample
and what does it means

175
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.650 
says nr takes a measures computes
a fingerprint computes a

176
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:40.660 
hash of the message and then a in
a sense that creates so cared

177
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.120 
digital signature and
digital signature

178
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:51.100 
is a consists of seeing
a encryption of c hash

179
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.030 
well you have
some message

180
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.540 
and say encryptions of see
a hash of some message

181
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.260 
is done with a private
key of system

182
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.600 
on the basis of set a signature
can verify is out in the city

183
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:16.070 
of since then and the
message why when the

184
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.750 
receiver receives a
message his then it

185
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.370 
he or she hatches
a message

186
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:29.780 
and then a on one side and then
as and as a receiver takes

187
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.990 
a digital signature and decrypts
the stages in a with a public

188
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:41.660 
key of says and and if it works
fine then he obtains the hash

189
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.370 
of message is under
has as ended and now

190
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:50.090 
the receiver can compare hash
he computed from the received

191
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:55.990 
message with a hash laos images
that was decrypted with a private

192
00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.260 
key of sustained no so
everyone is able to

193
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.890 
decrypt as with a
public key a ascender

194
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.430 
so as a co incident of
sir generate tesh

195
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.230 
and decrypted seems to show that
proves that the message comes

196
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.560 
from the center and it proves is
a message was not a modified

197
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.690 
on the transport away and the reason
a in why it is this verification

198
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.790 
is possible seno walls only one
by means of his private key

199
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.680 
to decrypt this hash of some
message in such a way

200
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.550 
that it can be decrypted
with his or her public key

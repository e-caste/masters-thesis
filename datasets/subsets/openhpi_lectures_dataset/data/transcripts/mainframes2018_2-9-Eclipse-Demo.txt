00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.909 
Hello, it's me again Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy,

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.129 
and in this next video clip, I want to do a short demonstration

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.899 
on Eclipse and how you can use Eclipse

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.489 
with some plugins to use interfaces

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.049 
to mainframe systems and subsystems.

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.179 
And I want to emphasize again, it's really a pure eclipse environment,

7
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.019 
it has, in this case, nothing to do with RDz.

8
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.459 
It means it's pure eclipse environment

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.289 
where you can download without any fees from the Oracle

10
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.999 
site. And in this case, you may see above.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.589 
It's the Java EE version of Eclipse, and now the Java

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.059 
EE perspective is opened, and now I could do and

13
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.529 
start Java EE project, but that's not

14
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.999 
what I want to do now. What I want to do now is show you that there are some

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.619 
extensions to eclipse, you can very easily plug

16
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.469 
in into this eclipse environment.

17
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.089 
And in this case, now I want to look at window and perspective

18
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.679 
and open perspective and other and I want to show you

19
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.809 
there are some already plugins installed,

20
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.819 
and in this case, we see as example, we have the CICS

21
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.709 
system messager, we have some other

22
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.419 
things available. And what I want to show now in this demonstration

23
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.929 
is the so-called z/OS Explorer.

24
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.569 
So I select now is a see the z/OS explorer.

25
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.219 
You can also plug in as example, MQ Explorer, there's as

26
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.079 
an IMS explorer, there are, I think, nearly for all

27
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.789 
subsystems on z/OS, you can have an explorer

28
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.649 
where you can extend your eclipse environment with

29
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.479 
such a plugin. And now I call the z/OS explorer selected

30
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.429 
and click on OK, and here you see, this is now

31
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.659 
the z/OS Eclipse Explorer.

32
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.309 
There are different possibilities to connect now and what

33
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.809 
I want to do because it's really the easiest interface is to do it

34
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.429 
via ISPF. So there are different possibilities and one thing just to mention

35
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.699 
is that also z/OS MF is available

36
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.669 
in this case.

37
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.489 
Also the z/OS MF the management facility is also

38
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.979 
an eclipse extension.

39
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.599 
Now I want to go to our z/OS, select the

40
00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.059 
FTP file transfer interface,

41
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.709 
and I want to add now our

42
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.319 
system. And here I can see the name.

43
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.047 
I say I want to go to our EMA z/OS.

44
00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:15.689 
Here I put my host name in, the

45
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.129 
IP address in this case.

46
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.689 
The port is the standard port 21.

47
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.069 
I have to select extended passive version and I

48
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.379 
do save and close.

49
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.199 
And now I want to connect

50
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.499 
and use existing credentials credentials.

51
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.709 
Yes, this is my user I.D. should be OK.

52
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.970 
I select okay and I am

53
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.729 
connected to the system, but it doesn't

54
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.730 
work.

55
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040 
Let's try with this one.

56
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.659 
OK, maybe I did a mistake, any case, as you see, I'm

57
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.699 
now connected to our system.

58
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.119 
And what is shown here now in this data set

59
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.539 
window, you'll see data set names.

60
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.519 
And in our last session, we see demonstration for

61
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.070 
TSO. I showed you

62
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.199 
the TEST.COBOL File. It's here and let's

63
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.029 
select the hello and now you see here, this is

64
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.139 
the hello information, it's the same we've got

65
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.629 
with our ISPF demonstration.

66
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.980 
OK, now I say hello mainframe @

67
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.300 
MOOC.

68
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.200 
I think I can save it, yes and

69
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.769 
no maybe I have to do this number on the right position.

70
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.449 
But now you see, I changed now the COBOL program

71
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.263 
to hello mainframe @ MOOC, now

72
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.119 
I save it.

73
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.649 
And then I go, It's the same procedure as with

74
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.960 
the ISPF demonstration. I go anow to TEST.CNTL and

75
00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.106 
here we got the member COBCLG for COBOL

76
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.149 
compile link and go.

77
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.079 
This is a JCL calling the procedure.

78
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.089 
This is a procedure which is called and I now use the

79
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.339 
right mouse button and say, I want to submit this job.

80
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.499 
OK, we submitted before we submitted it.

81
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.129 
We see, I say, you know, the two distinct

82
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.979 
it from the other submit we did in our ISPF demonstration.

83
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.559 
And I want to say I want to submit this job and the job is submitted

84
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.759 
to you on the console.

85
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.799 
OK. And I think we have to do a refresh

86
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.109 
here. Yes.

87
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.369 
And we see this is the the No.

88
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.259 
What are the the top name we selected

89
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.699 
here and now I double click on our

90
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.929 
D and here you'll see.

91
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.559 
Hello, mainframe @ our MOOC.

92
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.419 
So I think you can see it works and we can

93
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.219 
do such kind of stuff also in eclipse based

94
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.139 
environment. Just to mention it again, the the administrator's

95
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.969 
assistant program was working on IBM mainframes normally still use,

96
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.369 
and in my opinion, it's still useful to use ISPF as an interface.

97
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.049 
But the COBOL developer normally used such a graphical

98
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.729 
user interface, and I don't do a demonstration on RDz

99
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.529 
because I'm not see the expert in it, but especially

100
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.179 
we see RDz, you are as a developer, you are really, really much

101
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.579 
more productive than you will with ISPF.

102
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.259 
I just wanted to show you that you could also use a pure

103
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.729 
eclipse environment without any commercial extensions or

104
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.769 
things like this to use explores and has interfaces

105
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.129 
into the z/OS environment.

106
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.089 
That's what I wanted to show you in this demonstration.

107
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.799 
I hope you had some fun with it, and I hope we

108
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.339 
see us in one of our next video clips.

109
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.229 
Thank you very much for attending.

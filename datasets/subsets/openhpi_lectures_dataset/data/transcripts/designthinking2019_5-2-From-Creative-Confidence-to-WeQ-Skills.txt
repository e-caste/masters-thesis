00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.120 
So one of the things we were asked quite

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.000 
often through the last use was,
what is our first step?

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.240 
What can we do as first thing to start
a change process in the organization?

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.600 
And usually what I would answer is

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.680 
think of your space and start what I
would call a protected space to fail.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.320 
Look at your conference rooms and try
to redesign it in a way that is suitable

7
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.840 
to teams and create something where people
can try out all the three core elements,

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.000 
new environment, intuitive processes
and also collaborative work.

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.920 
And it should be protected also

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.800 
in the sense that there is no

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.240 
punishment for any crazy idea
which is happening there.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.120 
No punishment, but also no incentives.

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.040 
And building on that also allow the teams

14
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.240 
to pick something that's
meaningful to them.

15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
So don't impose a challenge on them
that they have to deal with, because

16
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.960 
otherwise, they can't experiment around
also playfulness and trying things out.

17
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.920 
And they also won't take ownership

18
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.320 
of the whole project because it has never
been their problem in the first sense.

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.960 
So therefore, meaningful challenges as

20
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.120 
a grassroots strategy to come out of
the team member's ideas, brains and heads.

21
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.400 
And if you then talk later to those
organizations who have started this kind

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.320 
of processes, that are running
kind of protected space to fail.

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.480 
You'll figure out that the people are
running through this environment

24
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.680 
and through the new experiences will
return back to the normal office space.

25
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.520 
And they liked it usually so much that they
start changing their whole environment,

26
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
their own environment,
talking to their colleagues

27
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.280 
and rearranging the way how they do
things, rearranging probably their

28
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.440 
conference room, and starting to spread the word.

29
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.200 
So that feels somehow like a virus,

30
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.320 
like a healthy virus, which is
spreading through the organization.

31
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.960 
So we've seen organizations,

32
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.280 
companies like having this little nut-shell of protected space and then growing

33
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.560 
into the first floor and then another
floor and then the whole building.

34
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.280 
And all the sudden you see the whole

35
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.520 
organization somehow infected
by this new kind of thinking.

36
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.720 
But what we've also noticed over a longer
period of time is that,

37
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.880 
yes, then the institution is kind
of running with a new mindset.

38
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.600 
But sooner or later,
you see the rest of the Brockhaus

39
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.720 
thinking are getting stronger
and stronger and stronger.

40
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.720 
And so what we need is somehow refreshment
booster injection of design thinking

41
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.000 
to refresh the minds of the people,
to get them more back into an agile mode.

42
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.680 
And this pattern of emergent strategy
that we actually do see an organization

43
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.760 
also want to foster is also reflected
in our recommendation when it comes to

44
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.880 
get to the future skills that are actually
needed to become a networked organization.

45
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.920 
Also for a person working there,

46
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.120 
because it's not something that you can
learn in one day, two day or three days

47
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.160 
training and then you are done
for the rest of your life.

48
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.400 
It's actually the other way around

49
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.200 
it's the approach of lifelong learning
and also getting those fresh injections

50
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.280 
also from the outside,
there might be new methods that might be

51
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.200 
new concepts that you have
never been trying out.

52
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.680 
So therefore,
this room for experimentation within

53
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.560 
the organization is needed
for the whole time.

54
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.000 
These spaces you create for new
experiences is a little bit similar

55
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.920 
to what we have here at the
School of Design thinking.

56
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.600 
It is a place for de-learning because

57
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.200 
we're all so trained to think in rigid
structures and linear structures that it

58
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.040 
actually takes a while, that you
will learn this new kind of habits.

59
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.640 
This new kind of skills.

60
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.720 
And this is also the place to develop
the new skills further on.

61
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.120 
We started actually some years ago
with a focus on creative confidence.

62
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.440 
We want to make every person more creative

63
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.480 
and being really creative on and confident
on their own, create creative power.

64
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.960 
No matter if I'm a lawyer,

65
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.960 
if I'm a medical person, if I'm a business
person, if I'm a creative person.

66
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.560 
Everyone has this kind of creative power.

67
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.440 
What we're focusing much more now is, we are
focusing on the collaborative creativity,

68
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.600 
the collaborative intelligence
and building bridges and bringing people

69
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.080 
together and joining forces, which ends up
with a much higher level of creativity.

70
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.400 
And this development is also reflected

71
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.120 
in our learning model that we have been
designing here for us

72
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.560 
at the HP D-School,
that actually ties all together to meet

73
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.920 
our competency in terms of being able
to take reflective action in a team.

74
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.280 
And this actually rests on four pillars.

75
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.240 
And just one of those four pillars is
procedural knowledge and competency,

76
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.920 
meaning that you are good
in terms of new processes.

77
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.600 
What typically design thinking is often
reduced to, which is not just a process.

78
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.880 
The second pillar is about gaining
inspiration from new content

79
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.120 
and developing yourself
further in that field.

80
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.280 
But the two others that are far more
important than the two before mentioned

81
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.640 
are the ones about personal development
and also the team development,

82
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.080 
leading to a new concept
that actually is shared leadership.

83
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.520 
And this you could also see
as the development of WQ

84
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.480 
skills.
So we have the IQ skill set and all

85
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.160 
of the people are coming
with that in the process.

86
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.120 
What will we do here at the school
and also in the workshops?

87
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.120 
And what you could do at your places,
at your new spaces is to develop

88
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.400 
the skills,
the skill set,

89
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.200 
which is not really developed yet,
the collaboration skill set.

90
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.360 
And actually, we have a lot of tools

91
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.520 
to measure the IQ, the intelligence
and the individual process.

92
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.280 
But we don't have a lot, if at all

93
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.080 
WQ tests so far.

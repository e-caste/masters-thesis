00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.180 
So, welcome again to our coffee
talk session for our openHPI

2
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.250 
course "Digital Entrepreneurship".
With this course, we aim to

3
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
introduce students to the world
of digital entrepreneurship

4
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.520 
with an emphasis on
entrepreneurship research.

5
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
We are very glad to have Erdinç
Koç as the leading start-up

6
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.330 
expert and one of the advocates
for building comprehensive

7
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.050 
entrepreneurial ecosystems
with us today.

8
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.200 
Now, we're eager to learn about your
take on the state of entrepreneurship

9
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.260 
in Berlin, randenburg and beyond and what
digital entrepreneurship does to this

10
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.420 
and I hope you have your coffee
or water ready and let's go. So,

11
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.760 
Erdinç, what's your background
what do you do?

12
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
Yeah, hello everyone and first of
all thank you for this invitation.

13
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.150 
My name is Erdinç and I'm working
for the Hasso Plattner Institute and

14
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.540 
I'm the head of the
MediaTech Hub Accelerator

15
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.140 
and what we do is we support early stage
startups with a six month program.

16
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.130 
And right now we have twenty
four startups in our portfolio

17
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.930 
and help them with all kinds of
challenges regarding sales,

18
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.930 
regarding HR, regarding fundraising and
whatever it is that the early stage

19
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.490 
founder faces right now.

20
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.910 
Yeah, in the last four years I
worked around with round about

21
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.260 
seventy early stage startups
and supported them

22
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.560 
within like for six months and beyond.
This is like mainly what I do.

23
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.210 
And for me, if I may just reflect personally,
Erdinç, you are the person who

24
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.250 
knows like everyone. So if I think
about entrepreneurial ecosystems,

25
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.740 
for me you are the one who actually
knows all those different

26
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.500 
partners and how to connect them.
So this is like, if I have

27
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.610 
a startup that comes to me and asks
me a question like, oh you know,

28
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.870 
would you have
contact there? So,

29
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.590 
I always kind of give them to
you. So this is kind of how I

30
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.460 
see your role. And what would you say now if we
come to the topic of digital entrepreneurship?

31
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.390 
What does digital entrepreneurship mean to you?
Is that different than other entrepreneurship?

32
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.690 
Yeah, it's a
good question.

33
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.970 
I mean, the definition of
entrepreneurship is

34
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.250 
it's really not so
clear, I would say.

35
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.790 
Like my perspective on
digital entrepreneurship is more

36
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.240 
from the perspective of the
venture capital world.

37
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.680 
So, for me the definition of a
start-up is its organization

38
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.820 
which is built for growth. So, that is
really important. So, you try to build

39
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.060 
organization and software specific
problem with a digital business

40
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.510 
model and try to grow
as fast as possible.

41
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.580 
And this is for me the definition
personally, but if you ask

42
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.690 
different people, you will get
different answers and what we

43
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.060 
do with our accelerator,
we not only support

44
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.480 
startups who are focusing on
venture capital, we also support

45
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.280 
startups who say like, hey
you know what, I want to grow

46
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.660 
organically, I don't need venture
capital, I want to bootstrap

47
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.350 
and I want to build a digital
agency that's totally fine for

48
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.080 
us, but as long it's a
digital business model.

49
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.310 
So, for you basically digital
entrepreneurship is entrepreneurship,

50
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.790 
right, because that's what
you do right? Exactly.

51
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.360 
So if we think about

52
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.870 
this term which I introduce as
entrepreneurial ecosystem,

53
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.400 
how would you describe that? I mean,
how how does it manifest for you?

54
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.150 
I would take the example of
the digital entrepreneurship

55
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.810 
ecosystem in Babelsberg, Potsdam
or Brandenburg.

56
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.640 
And, I mean, in Babelsberg we have
the privilege that we have three

57
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.670 
universities, we run about
twenty three thousand

58
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.960 
students, I would say,

59
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.060 
and then beyond that
we have a different

60
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.460 
organization from the
economy or from politics

61
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.260 
and we all have one mission to empower
entrepreneurship and innovation.

62
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.380 
That's why we come together and
try to work together and build

63
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.360 
the MediaTech Hub Accelerator. It's an
initiative of three universities

64
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.780 
which is supported by the
government and by the

65
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.790 
economy and we as an
accelerator we can't

66
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.740 
we have somethings that we are really
good at and something that we lack.

67
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.930 
And if we don't know we try to
connect the relevant startup

68
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.980 
with the relevant key
players in the market

69
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.810 
and we always say we are only
as good as our network. So, we

70
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.970 
are not the solution for everything
but we knows but when we

71
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.580 
collect the whole network, I think
we can support the startups

72
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.470 
in a different way.

73
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.040 
In your experience,
because we have

74
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.240 
kind of sit in similar meetings
within this ecosystems and

75
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.440 
I sometimes have the impression that some
of the actors work together better

76
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.160 
and some always kind of fight because they
feel like "oh I'm the most important

77
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.580 
actor", so what's your impression
here and how can you actually

78
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.160 
kind of get them away from
this "oh, I'm the alpha

79
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.780 
person in the room"? Yeah, yeah,
it's a challenging situation

80
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.840 
for sure. I definitely
faced the situation.

81
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.030 
My experience so far is

82
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.080 
the cooperation or
the collaboration

83
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.940 
is based on the people who are in
power in the different positions.

84
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.620 
And it's not related to the
organization. So, let's say if

85
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.670 
if I wanna work with a specific
university, it's based

86
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.930 
on my present relationship to the relevant
person. So I need to build trust

87
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.330 
and in some cases it needs

88
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.910 
quite some time to build the
trust, in some cases pretty fast.

89
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.910 
In Berlin for example, so I personally
live in Berlin but I work

90
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.840 
in Brandenburg. And it's a different
eco-system in Berlin, it's like

91
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.710 
you go straight to the point. And in
Brandenburg, you build the trust.

92
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.190 
But as soon you get to
trust you can build

93
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.420 
you can build a strong
connection on that.

94
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.540 
And what we say
is always

95
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.780 
only together we can build
something great. And that's always

96
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.590 
what we try to remember
the people on.

97
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.950 
That's an interesting
observation, that Berlin

98
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.890 
comes very quick to the point
and Brandenburg needs this little bit more.

99
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.330 
Where else do you see
differences?

100
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:39.540 
Where else - I mean when it comes to the
eco-system or if I connect or

101
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.180 
compare Brandenburg and Berlin,
in Berlin you have like a

102
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.420 
world wide community.

103
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.590 
Like you have different investors
from all over the world,

104
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.740 
you have start-ups from
all over the world,

105
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.150 
you have reputation, you created
an eco-system. Not overnight but

106
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.430 
since years. And it's driven
the cosystem is driven by the

107
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.610 
private economy. And in Brandenburg
there is the feeling the start

108
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.880 
up is driven by the
public institutions

109
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.990 
and the public institutions
have a different kind

110
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.650 
of mindset and
different interests.

111
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:22.150 
And you can feel that when you engage
with them in a different levels and

112
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.300 
but I would say Brandenburg
may be smaller but

113
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.550 
more intense because people know each
other. So there you have shortcuts.

114
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.730 
So if I'm not the relevant person
I know for sure who could

115
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.210 
be the relevant person. Just a
quick call, a quick message and

116
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.760 
then you can open doors for the
startups. Right, that's really

117
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.670 
interesting because, I mean, you
would assume that if you have

118
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:52.060 
such a strong political influence,
that the ecosystem could be slower

119
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.770 
or maybe more formalized but what
you just described shows me that

120
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.860 
it might actually work if you
have political parties involved.

121
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.190 
So what would you say,
I mean, if you had

122
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.430 
if you had a wish, I mean,
how would you shape

123
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.930 
this ecosystem further or what
would you say could Berlin learn

124
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.480 
from Brandenburg and
Brandenburg learn from bBerlin?

125
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:28.030 
Oh, I think, I mean, COVID is a good
example. With all the challenges

126
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.430 
it created, also opportunities
and if you observe right now

127
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.570 
I think there will be

128
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.160 
or you will see
less borders between

129
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.770 
the ecosystems or between the
federal states or countries

130
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.550 
because when we engage with startups right
now, we can see they're participating

131
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:56.100 
in the office hours format in the US, they
participate in accelerator program in Munich

132
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.620 
but they sit in Brandenburg, but they
got the first investment from Hamburg.

133
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.120 
So, within the startup world and
especially venture capital world

134
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:10.720 
there are no borders as in our real
life I would say. So nowadays

135
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.440 
when we encourage founders when
they look for fundraising, look

136
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.010 
beyond Germany. Look at least to
Europe or the US because

137
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.630 
there are a lot of
opportunities.

138
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.550 
And what we can
learn from

139
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.560 
Berlin or on the
upsidde, I think

140
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.560 
we have a strong

141
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.340 
mission

142
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.490 
coming from the public institutions.
I mean, the collaboration

143
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.810 
between private and public is really
good in my opinion in Brandenburg

144
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.610 
and because of the trust relationships
where we have like really short

145
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.730 
connections and I think it's
really powerful when you

146
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.910 
support start-ups. And this is
this is like our advantage and

147
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.540 
this is what we see when we
collaborate with all the startups

148
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.640 
that we can help from
different angles.

149
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.580 
And if you say that

150
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.160 
this is an opportunity that
actually for the founders it's

151
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.450 
not Berlin or Brandenburg anymore but
it is the world, but on the same

152
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.690 
side I would think that

153
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.560 
if you are an entrepreneur, you're
a young entrepreneur or an

154
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.830 
olerd entrepreneur, but
you just started,

155
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.780 
that might make it very difficult.
If, you know, once it was only

156
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.420 
Potdam and you know like okay,
there's the bank and there's

157
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.380 
the university and this is kind
of people I have to talk to. Now

158
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.820 
you tell me, well dear founder
look to the world. I mean, where

159
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.610 
do I start, how do I do
this? Don't they feel overwhelmed?

160
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.370 
Tthat's true.

161
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.980 
I mean, what we see in our work, we mostly
engage with first time founders

162
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.180 
and I always say these are
well educated people

163
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.880 
from a specific industry

164
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.830 
but they engaged the first
time with entrepreneurship

165
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.860 
and it's a different
mindset and

166
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.090 
and then within, so we help them
to understand the language

167
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.070 
of the start-up world.

168
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.050 
And then also within the language,
there's a dialect of the

169
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.450 
venture capital world. So it feels
like if someone would tell

170
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.860 
me Erdinç, you will go to Beijing
China and you will learn, you

171
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.830 
have to learn within six months the
accelerator program Mandarin

172
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.890 
and then on top of
that Cantonese.

173
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:47.690 
It's overwhelming and also you have to
do so many things at the same time.

174
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.820 
Fundraising, sales, hiring, building
the product, building the

175
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.300 
organization and so on. It's really
overwhelming and what we tried

176
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.610 
we helped to decides the focus
what's really relevant right now.

177
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.050 
And our job is also to
show opportunities.

178
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.860 
And then the founders responsible
which opportunity do I take.

179
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.690 
That's why we create a different
database. We share experience

180
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:21.090 
from other founders, we connect
them with other founders. So

181
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.790 
as a founder you have the
opportunity to see the

182
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.690 
world from
different angles.

183
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.500 
So basically, I mean, if I take
that, if I've kind of put it all

184
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.150 
together, I would say, well there are
great opportunities and challenges -

185
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.120 
great opportunities but
also challenges and if you have

186
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.350 
an ecosystem that becomes so
digital, international and fluid,

187
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.230 
you need to have people like
you, for example, that actually

188
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.050 
help them to navigate through
this ecosystem, right, because

189
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.340 
as a founder I only
focus on my venture?

190
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.160 
I always encourage the founders
to surround themselves

191
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.500 
with people who
believe in

192
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:12.190 
them and also surround people who are
successful already in that business.

193
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.950 
Surround yourself with other founders
who already raised money, who already

194
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.780 
launched a product, who already
sold the product, who already

195
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.380 
hired the first team members and
then also with different people

196
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.750 
who are ahead of you, so you
can keep up with them.

197
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.690 
That's really important.

198
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.810 
And then there's the mix of the
people we're surrounded by,

199
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.270 
who are surrounding you. That's really
really important. Yeah, I think

200
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.900 
that's a great
recommendation.

201
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.630 
Unfortunately, we come
to the end of our coffe-talk

202
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.800 
and today's your lucky day
because I'm a fairy.

203
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.950 
You know, you cannot tell but sometimes
I am a fairy and you have

204
00:14:52.950 --> 00:15:01.430 
a wish. I grant you a wish, only one.
So, what would be your final wish?

205
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.280 
My final wish is

206
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.430 
that we would teach people to think
in visions and not only goals.

207
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.470 
This is, like, my wish.

208
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.090 
That's very nice. Thank you so much. This
has been a great pleasure

209
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.670 
and hope to see you soon.

210
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.930 
Thank you.

1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.250 
Let's have a brief look at the
history of computers in our

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.550 
OpenHPI course half-century
of internet.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.600 
When we look for the starting point of the
development of the first universal computer.

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.140 
We have to point to the

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.470 
calculating
machines that

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.740 
this was the first program-controlled
mechanical calculation machine.

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.890 
In US Aiken, in the time
mainframe HARVARD Mark I,

8
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.650 
which also needs to be
mentioned. It was developed in

9
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.570 
1939-44. And from Zuse

10
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.780 
an improved machine no more a
mechanical calculation machine

11
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.180 
but an electronic computation
machine Z3 was developed

12
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.800 
in 1941.

13
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.950 
And then World War II pushed the
development of the computers.

14
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.820 
Because the people in
Lab for which worked

15
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
on decoding the Enigma machine,
the encryption machine of the

16
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.770 
German army. So when they worked on the
decoding, they saw that they could get

17
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.010 
much support
by devices,

18
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.070 
like a computer. So they
designed to develop Colossus

19
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.480 
as a supporting
machine.

20
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.530 
And they were successful with the
encoding of Enigma. And then when we

21
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.690 
we speak about the first fully
electronic universal computer,

22
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.970 
we have to
mention ENIAC.

23
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.620 
ENIAC came in 1945,

24
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.330 
the build it was created and
designed by Eckert, Mauchly,

25
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.440 
Goldstine, Neumann and with
18,000 electron tubes.

26
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.800 
In that time the transistor
was not yet developed.

27
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.170 
Let's have a look at two more
milestones in the development

28
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.070 
Of course, the invention of the
transistor. was a very important step.

29
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.020 
That was 1947. Development
of a magnetic disk storage

30
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.310 
was in 1956 by IBM.

31
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.680 
and 10 years after the invention
of the transistor, already

32
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.630 
first integrated circuits
were produced.

33
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.110 
Then in the beginning
of the 60s,

34
00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.500 
with these devices and technologies the
first microcomputers we have developed.

35
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.430 
So in 1917, we have
to mention Intel

36
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.380 
4004 microprocessor, we
have to mention in 1979,

37
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.810 
the first microcomputer Apple II, which
was a developed, Jobs and Wozniak.

38
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.770 
And so we have to mention the
first PC, the personal computer

39
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.230 
developed by
IBM in 1981.

40
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.790 
The development of computers is
divided into different generations.

41
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.310 
So it's the first generation,
its developments

42
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.230 
in the years
1945 to 1956.

43
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.790 
So this was a time to develop
modern computer systems

44
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.580 
starting from the
punched cards.

45
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.310 
by the Second World War, so machines, were
designed for very specific purposes comments

46
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.470 
and work instructions were designed
for very specific purposes.

47
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.310 
So different instructions that have made
programming very difficult. It was exactly

48
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.890 
designed for one type of computer.
There was no standardization.

49
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.720 
And so basic technologies that were
used in time in the first generation

50
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.640 
of the computers is electron tubes,
punch cards and magnetic drum storage

51
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.250 
and the second generation
It was from 1956 to 1963.

52
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:53.220 
This was a generation of
transition-based computers.

53
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.460 
transition-based
computers is a period

54
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.320 
of different developments but characterized
by the programming become simpler,

55
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.570 
computers allow batch operation,
and then input and outputs are

56
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.220 
punch cards or even
magnetic tapes.

57
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.260 
The third generation in the
U.S. in 1963 to 1971,

58
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:31.700 
and this was at the time the computers used
integrated circuits so-called chips.

59
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.540 
So based on this technology the
computers could become smaller,

60
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.720 
they could become more powerful,
more energy-efficient.

61
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.320 
And this was also the time that one was
thinking and developing operating systems

62
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.450 
for multi programmable operating systems,
this is what the computers need

63
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.260 
to run programs of different type
and is this operating system which

64
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.520 
allows to run several
programs in the same time.

65
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.160 
And then the fourth
generation.

66
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.750 
It's not clear exactly, is
accounted for 1971 till today

67
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.280 
which is characterised by the
usage of microprocessors

68
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.500 
and highly integrated circuits, circuits
with millions of transistors.

69
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:35.710 
The prices were going down drastically
and graphical user interfaces were

70
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.890 
in the phases, we develop which made
it possible is that computers

71
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:48.160 
developed, which made it possible that computers are also used
by people, which are no specialists in computer science.

72
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.770 
So is this graphical
user interfaces

73
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.790 
which make it so simple to control
and operate and use a computer,

74
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.660 
they brought a computer into private
households and lead to this

75
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.000 
huge expansion
you see. Also,

76
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.830 
you see local networks
become more common.

77
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.450 
So the question of how to interconnect
computers become more and more important.

78
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:26.130 


79
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.810 
People are also speaking about
the fifth generation they do

80
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.520 
They do this worldwide and they say
that the computers of the future

81
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.240 
So the development here get
inputs from the field of

82
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.510 
artificial intelligence and ubiquitous
computing, Mobile computing.

83
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.570 
As a parallelization was a very important
trend in the multi-processor system.

84
00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.880 
A large amount of memory is available.
So, for example, in memory-technology

85
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:08.330 
and memory, it becomes cheap,
speech recognition becomes

86
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.980 
possible and works quite well. So one can
interact with computers not only by

87
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.760 
by using keyboards and writing down
words, but also speak with computers

88
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.900 
and then the transformation
of the computers from

89
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:32.020 
the classic desktop into small devices
to a tablet PC to a smartphone,

90
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.630 
to other devices, and then, of
course, increasing in the

91
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:43.620 
usage of memory and computing power
outside of of the own hardware.

92
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.390 
This is what's possible
in the cloud.

93
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:54.620 
This was a brief history of computers.
And again, you see such devices,

94
00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:02.470 
cloud computing play a more and more
important role. And these are unthinkable

95
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.940 
without the internet.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970 
I'd like to invite you to our
new online course on openHPI.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.640 
The course is about internet and
internet technology and the

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.540 
title is "A Half Century of
Internet: How It Works Today"

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.190 
and the course start
on first September.

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.570 
These are all the countless applications
and services of the upcoming

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.510 
new digital world. Email, instant
messaging and chats, voice-over IP,

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.810 
media streaming for video and music,
online gaming platforms for

8
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.520 
cooperative work, file transfer, cloud
services that provide in the back

9
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.550 
computational services computational
spaces for storing data.

10
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.130 
In our flats in our cities we see more and
more Internet of Things application.

11
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.990 
And all is accessible via
the world wide web.

12
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.090 
And if you ask what is the basic
technology of world wide web, then

13
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.970 
it's the internet. The internet
provides the basic infrastructure

14
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.040 
of this new digital world. And the internet
- this is a network of networks.

15
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.400 
And by means of the internet
protocols this network as networks

16
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.240 
looks for the user like a uniform
and homogeneous network.

17
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.080 
So what we want to do in our course
is that we in the first week

18
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.070 
speak about the many applications
of the new digital world

19
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220 
to see the great variety of
things which are provided here.

20
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.300 
And then in the second week
we look how computer

21
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.430 
how smartphones communicate
with each other.

22
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.300 
We need to understand this
because the internet

23
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.660 
is a network of such
computer networks.

24
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
And by means of the
communication protocols this

25
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.060 
network of networks looks like a
homogeneous networks for the user.

26
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.530 
We have and we will do this in the
fourth week to discuss how transport

27
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.370 
is organised over
the internet.

28
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.830 
How it's guaranteed that the data
are received in the same way

29
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.840 
they are sent from
the origin.

30
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.480 
And then we go
back to the

31
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.610 
colorful world of
internet application.

32
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.560 
Applications may use the internet,
is only possible by means of

33
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.570 
communication protocols that connects
the internet, connects the application

34
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.960 
to the internet. And then in the
final sixth week of our course

35
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.250 
we want to discuss
cybersecurity aspects

36
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.390 
of all this. So we want to enable
you to move safe and securely

37
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.140 
in this digital world.

38
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.810 
What do you
need to know

39
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.220 
when you want to take
part in our course?

40
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.460 
Everyone is invited. What we want to provide
is a better understanding of the internet,

41
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.280 
of the technologies that are used
there, we want to understand how

42
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.850 
it works and what it means and we
want to present this in a form

43
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.970 
that's usable, therefore everyone. So
everyone is welcome. There are no

44
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.780 
pre-requirements that are need to be
fulfilled to take part in our course.

45
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.740 
The learning material is presented
in short learning videos,

46
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.420 
in interactive quizzes and tasks and
for such interactive courses the

47
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.480 
forum discussions are very important.
Here the learners have the possibility

48
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.830 
to interact and discuss
with other learners

49
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.330 
to interact and discuss with members
of the teaching team which

50
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.310 
support me in this course, to get
a full understanding of all

51
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.410 
the presented
learning materials.

52
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.930 
And at the end if you successfully finish
the course then you can receive a

53
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.090 
certificate. There are different
certificates - participation certificates,

54
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.340 
qualified certificates, Learn more on
the website of openHPI about it.

55
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.990 
And these are the dates of our course
"A Half Century of Internet".

56
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.680 
Course start I mentioned
already is first September

57
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.870 
and the course ends on
October twentieth

58
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.430 
and it consists of six
weeks with learning

59
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.660 
and a final week
with the exam.

60
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.490 
I hope to see you in our new
online course on openHPI "A Half

61
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.490

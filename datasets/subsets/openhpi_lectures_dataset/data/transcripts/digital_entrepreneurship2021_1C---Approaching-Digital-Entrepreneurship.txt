1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.270 
So what does digital entrepreneurship stand for?

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.964 
How does the scientific community define it and how does it relate to entrepreneurship

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000 
as such?

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.021 
During today's session, you will learn what VUCA stands for

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640 
and how and why this acronym is relevant in an entrepreneurial context.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.670 
Further, we will share with you our understanding of digital entrepreneurship.

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.760 
By the end of the session. You should be able to explain some defining

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.509 
aspects of this concept.

9
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.272 
Perhaps you've already heard about it during your studies or at work or read about it in

10
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.890 
the newspaper: VUCA, or the phrase "We live in a VUCA

11
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.819 
world". VUCA stands for the words Volatility, Uncertainty,

12
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.979 
Complexity, and Ambiguity and it aims to reflect the perception

13
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.550 
that the world we live in today is ever changing.

14
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.779 
We have to deal with volatile and unstable markets, we have to consider

15
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.040 
uncertain futures and that some future developments might not be able to predict.

16
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.779 
We have to understand that this leads to the increased complexity of the challenges we

17
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.579 
have to deal with. And lastly, this complexity can lead to increased ability

18
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
and makes us question our own decisions.

19
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.708 
That's entrepreneurship researchers, we must keep in mind the challenges

20
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.029 
that come along with a continuous change of the VUCA world we

21
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.469 
live in. Through entrepreneurship research, we have developed

22
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.870 
an understanding of how entrepreneurial thinking can tackle

23
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.819 
the VUCA world and what entrepreneurs can contribute to addressing

24
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.530 
the grand challenges of today and tomorrow.

25
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.127 
Digitalisation has created one of the most fundamental shifts of our time

26
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.650 
and has changed the business world forever.

27
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.739 
Today, we live in a so-called digital economy.

28
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.379 
The digital economy consists of four major parts: Digital

29
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.222 
Transformation, Digital Ecosystem, Digital Education, and,

30
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.940 
of course, Digital Entrepreneurship.

31
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.840 
For this open HPI, of course, we will take a closer look at digital entrepreneurship.

32
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.849 
Digital entrepreneurship is about people discovering

33
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.398 
and identifying new opportunities within the context

34
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.203 
of digitalisation. Through digitalisation, new businesses

35
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.831 
have developed and have tremendously challenged established

36
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.550 
businesses and non-digital traditional entrepreneurs.

37
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.710 
Digital entrepreneurs clearly differentiate from traditional entrepreneurs

38
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.803 
because they use novel digital technologies to create new

39
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.227 
businesses or transform existing ones.

40
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.789 
Examples of these mentioned digital technologies include social media,

41
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.679 
big data or cloud infrastructure.

42
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.949 
Through this shift from traditional entrepreneurship to digital entrepreneurship,

43
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.907 
new businesses are growing much faster and oftentimes

44
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.342 
in an international context.

45
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.039 
The degree of how digital an entrepreneurial endeavour is can differ

46
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.590 
depending on which aspects of a new venture are digitalised.

47
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.059 
Some digital entrepreneurs merely offer a digital product or

48
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.804 
service, such as an app, whereas others have digitalised

49
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.620 
the whole business model and build upon a digital infrastructure.

50
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.639 
So, not only the degree of digitalisation effects entrepreneurship, but

51
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.700 
moreover, digital technologies can play three different roles within the context

52
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.289 
of digital entrepreneurship. Firstly, digital technologies can shape the entrepreneurial

53
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.929 
opportunities as so-called digital artefacts.

54
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.597 
Digital artefacts are a digital software or hardware that is part of a new physical

55
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.629 
product or service. Examples of digital artefacts are fitness apps that

56
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.590 
run on smartwatches.

57
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.449 
Secondly, digital technologies can take the role of the digital infrastructure,

58
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.999 
which we need to create new things.

59
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.069 
Digital infrastructure helps entrepreneurs communicate and collaborate

60
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.892 
with others. An example of digital infrastructures that play an essential role

61
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.750 
for many entrepreneurs are crowdsourcing platforms.

62
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.479 
Here, they can raise capital for new ideas, collect new ideas

63
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.100 
or find collaborators.

64
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.459 
Thirdly, digital technologies can take the form of digital platforms,

65
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.109 
digital platforms have received increased research interests as they have been growing

66
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.110 
extensively over the past years and have influenced the worldwide economy.

67
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.110 
Digital platforms bring together different Akhurst together in one place.

68
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.709 
Famous example of digital platforms are social media platforms such as Facebook or

69
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.760 
Instagram or service oriented platforms such as Airbnb.

70
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.790 
These different roles of digital technologies should give you an impression

71
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.853 
of how complex entrepreneurship has become in the context

72
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.278 
of the digital economy.

73
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.136 
As entrepreneurship researchers, we want to shed some light on the relevant research

74
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.029 
findings concerning digital entrepreneurship.

75
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.785 
For the upcoming sessions, we will go more in-depth into the core

76
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.660 
topics of digital entrepreneurship, such as collaboration

77
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.839 
and entrepreneurial ecosystems.

78
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.022 
Before we do this, however, we want to establish a unison scientific

79
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.520 
understanding of how new knowledge in this field of research

80
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.170 
is created and how it is then communicated to the scientific

81
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.860 
and practical world. So, let's get started.

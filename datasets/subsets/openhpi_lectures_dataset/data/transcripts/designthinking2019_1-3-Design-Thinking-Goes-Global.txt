00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.870 
Let's even zoom a little
bit further out and let's

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.390 
look at the world map, and see how
design thinking was spreading out.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.770 
Through the last years and if
you look at the map in 2007,

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.030 
you just see two dots. Those are the
two institutions training students

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.880 
basically in Design Thinking, and
that was at Stanford D School

6
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.980 
and the D School in Potsdam, the
sister institution. If you

7
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.460 
look at the world map right now,
you see a lot more dots popping

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.150 
up and a lot of interest growing
through the last years.

9
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.470 
And we get actually visitors nearly every
week from somewhere on the planet,

10
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.100 
of both people who are interested
in implementing Design Thinking,

11
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.380 
and their Organization, their University,
their Learning environment or even starting

12
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.340 
initiatives and institutions
from scratch. In 2017,

13
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.010 
on our 10th anniversary, we were thinking
it's time now to start a Global

14
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.680 
Design Thinking alliance and we are now
having eleven members, in five continents.

15
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.410 
This global network is actually
very strong, not only for us,

16
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.400 
but also for our project partners
very interesting. Because

17
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.380 
we have large organizations,
globally acting companies, who are

18
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
really interested in innovation
processes, in a one continent

19
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.310 
and at the same time in other continent,
to get out the differences,

20
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.100 
the cultural differences between
Asia, United States or Europe.

21
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.620 
And we also started using that global
network for the exchange of coaches

22
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.190 
and students, and also starting
something which we call the

23
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.880 
Global Design Thinking week, a highly
interesting format, incorporating

24
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.660 
project partners from the outside
and also people from different

25
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.710 
places on the planet. Different D
Schools joining forces for one very

26
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.660 
intense Design Thinking week. And
if it is staying with a view

27
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.110 
on the Globe, there is also a growing
network of companies, of organizations,

28
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.610 
using Design Thinking at their
daily practice and it's called

29
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.600 
Design at business and network,
started by Nestle and Philips,

30
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.300 
and SAP some years ago, and there
are more than 130 companies now

31
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.360 
joining forces, meeting on a regular
basis, it is a kind of virtual

32
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.180 
network, but it's probably highly
interesting also for you.

33
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.980 
And now since you know there is
an academic network, a global

34
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.210 
one, and there is also a global
network of business institutions,

35
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.990 
I have the wish that our online
learning course for the next

36
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.510 
five weeks could also generate a new
kind of network with another dynamic.

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.730 
Hello and welcome to the mainframe mooc part two about Fujitsu

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.170 
BS2000 with reliable and innovative platform for business critical applications.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.970 
My name is Felicitas Birkner and over the next minutes I would

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.240 
like to give you a brief introduction about Fujitsu BS2000

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.480 
mainframes in particular.

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.180 
Let's have a look on some key developments.

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.660 
The roots of BS2000 mainframes

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.660 
date back to nineteen sixty eight and are time-sharing operating system TSOS

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.250 
which was the first operating system providing virtual addressing

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.120 
and which Siemens used for developing BS2000

11
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.960 
and for example which Siemens used also for providing data processing support

12
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.370 
for the Olympic games in 1972

13
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.130 
in Germany in Munich.

14
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.950 
The focus of all the developments will always intensified in response

15
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
with the eye to trends and customer demands

16
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.980 
and all the developments also enabled

17
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.680 
the adoption of changes necessary to compete in a world driven by internet technologies.

18
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.460 
We are facing a lot of key innovations and developments such

19
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.680 
as in nineteen ninety with virtual machine VM2000

20
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.430 
which opened up a new dimension

21
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.100 
enabling BS2000 systems to run in parallel -

22
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.870 
several BS2000 systems to run in parallel only on one mainframe

23
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.950 
even with different release versions

24
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.910 
or in 1997 with the launch of the web transactions

25
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.690 
the BS2000

26
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.740 
applications got internet compatibility

27
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.420 
without having to modify the applications.

28
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.820 
Generally speaking since 1996

29
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.290 
BS2000 evolved from the classic three ninety architecture

30
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.490 
to the open hardware platform to the open standard hardware platforms

31
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.410 
and the porting of BS2000 to RISC to SPARC to x86 architectures

32
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.430 
as well with support of net storage were important milestones

33
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.840 
and important building blocks for the future viability of mainframes.

34
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.260 
In the early two thousands Fujitsu acquired the complete commercial

35
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.640 
IT area from Siemens

36
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.460 
including the BS2000 development division.

37
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.190 
The launch of the SE series of BS2000 mainframes in 2014

38
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.260 
enabled the systems

39
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.390 
to operate the BS2000 linux and windows in one mainframe architecture.

40
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.520 
This was a great milestone in the whole history of BS2000 mainframes

41
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.730 
and today

42
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.180 
BS2000 as the infrastructures provide a complete infrastructure covering server,

43
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.410 
software, peripheral and network under a common management

44
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.680 
and goes hand in hand with BS2000 next generation developments.

45
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.980 
In light of the digitization

46
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.960 
the SE concept is very interesting for organizations especially

47
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.690 
as it's based on integration and openness.

48
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.990 
As digitization continues to grow,

49
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.780 
so do the volumes of data that needs to be processed.

50
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.270 
And as transactions processes increase,

51
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.960 
where is more need to cope on integration, complexity and security

52
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.670 
key technologies demand for secure, flexible,

53
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.640 
strong and adaptable platforms.

54
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.880 
And today's mainframes

55
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.250 
provide such kind of platforms

56
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.120 
with outstanding perspectives

57
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.270 
and re-supplies to the democratical development

58
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.340 
aspects such as training,

59
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.670 
know-how transfer, experience change, IT talent recruiting

60
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.180 
are increasing critically in the mainframe sector across

61
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.210 
all the industries.

62
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.660 
And therefore Fujitsu

63
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.270 
has established the so called enterprise platform services mainframe academy

64
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.820 
in order to provide training initiatives, holistic training,

65
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.650 
targeted trainings for all the target groups of students and employees

66
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.470 
and customer area and partners

67
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.070 
providing corporations with academics and with customers and

68
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.020 
partners as well.

69
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.150 
Why? To offer trainings, know-how transfer,

70
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.790 
insights into the mainframe technology

71
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.410 
and to support carrier paths

72
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.010 
for an exciting environment.

73
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.480 
An environment which covers integration, management and running.

74
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.240 
Running the operations of different applications,

75
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.740 
running of BS2000 linux and windows within one infrastructure

76
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.050 
with mainframe quality

77
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:22.590 
and all of these provided BS2000 comprehensive services

78
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.680 
to make today's mainframes ready for a digital world.

79
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.300

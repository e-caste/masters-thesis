00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.690 
Welcome to the fourth week of our openHPI
course - A Half Century of Internet

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.470 
how it works today

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.680 
and in this fourth week we
concentrate as to the protocols

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.020 
on the transport layer of the
internet of the transport layer of

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.680 
TCP/IP protocol stack

6
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.030 
communication is a very complex task,
all the communication in the internet

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.420 
and for that reason we need something
like a network operating system

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.280 
to handle communication

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.230 
and remind you that we already discussed
and have seen that communication

10
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.440 
if we look to its nature then
it's a very hierarchical one

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.310 
and following this hierarchical nature it's
possible to subdivide the communication process

12
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.720 
in a sequence of
different smaller tasks

13
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.480 
that can be attributed to the different
layers of the internet communication model

14
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.410 
and here is internet communication
model we already introduce

15
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.970 
that the TCP/IP protocol stack with
the hardware layer, which often

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.230 
is not counted to be part of the
TCP/IP protocol stack to the

17
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.910 
link layer which describes
the work in the physical

18
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.440 
in the physical network technologies
then we have the internet layer

19
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
last week we discussed on all
the tasks that communication

20
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.020 
tasks that were fulfilled on the
internet layer by means of

21
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.490 
the IP protocols the internet
protocol and now we want to speak

22
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.910 
about the transport protocol as transport
layer and the protocols on that layer

23
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.980 
then next week we look to the
application layer to discuss

24
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.920 
how application can use the
internet for their communication

25
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.610 
so let's have a closer look to the
protocols in the transport layer

26
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.890 
and the protocols in the transport layer
are based on a connectionless service

27
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.930 
which is provided by the protocols
on the IP layer - the IP protocol

28
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.500 
you remember? The IP protocol is a
connectionless as a resistance packet-oriented

29
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.450 
all the communications messages
are subdivided in the packages

30
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.050 
packets are then through
the internet one by one

31
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.510 
there is what the protocols on the
transport layer can make use of

32
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.930 
we have a very popular TCP protocol -
the transmission control protocol

33
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.040 
and the UDP protocol - the user data
protocol which is much simpler and

34
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.410 
TCP protocol besides the IP protocol
are the most important parts of this

35
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.020 
network operating systems and we
will understand and consider

36
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.680 
in this week

37
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.280 
there are more protocols on the
TCP/IP protocol stack on the

38
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.540 
transport layer they are based on
TCP or UDP and to mention are

39
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.590 
ISO/T1 until ISO/T4, NetBIOS,
Real-Time protocols (RTP protocol)

40
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.450 
System Network Architectures
(SNA protocol) and others

41
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.050 
So, the main topics this week is that we
will consider TCP and UDP in details

42
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.020 
TCP - the transmission control
protocol is based on an unreliable

43
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.700 
IP protocol and TCP offers a
reliable transmission service

44
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.390 
for data exchange between
two communication partners

45
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.380 
TCP makes use of IP, IP provides
us packet transport service

46
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.710 
and TCP guarantees that all the
packets reach the communication

47
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.190 
partner in the right order, also TCP in
contrast to IP provides a reliable

48
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.950 
a transmission service

49
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.850 
and beside of IP, the well designed
and very complex TCP protocol

50
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.120 
contribute most to the
success of the internet

51
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.450 
and besides of the very complex
TCP protocol, there is a second

52
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.130 
important protocol on the transport
layer that the user data protocol

53
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.170 
it's much simpler than the TCP
protocol and it offers a simple

54
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.830 
insecure and connectionless
transmission service in the internet

55
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.320 
TCP provides a connection-based
transmission service, UDP provides

56
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.910 
connectionless transmission
service like the IP protocol

57
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.620 
and UDP is used, for example, for
video streaming and voice over IP

58
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.100 
we also will
consider this week

59
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.270 
how we can make the data transport
more secure and for that

60
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.790 
reason we will discuss the
transport layer security

61
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.820 
a protocols by means the messages which are
sent over the internet can be encrypted

62
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.740 
where authentication can be done and
others so this is a program of

63
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.160 
this week I hope you will enjoy,
let's start to work now

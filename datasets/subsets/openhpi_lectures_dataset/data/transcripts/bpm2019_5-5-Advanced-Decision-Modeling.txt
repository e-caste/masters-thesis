00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.270 
Yeah welcome to video clip
five point five in which

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.430 
I want to show you some ways to model
with these advanced decision logic.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.880 
Therefore I'd
like to create

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.500 
a new decision model in
the process manager.

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.990 
And here I want to show you how to
calculate values to use multiple inputs

6
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.250 
in order to provide or to
use them and calculate one

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.330 
final output
like a sum.

8
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.740 
And imagine you have three
inputs one of them is the unit

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.230 
or the amount of units
you want to order.

10
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.090 
The costs per unit

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.410 
and we could also
have a discount.

12
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.330 
Now we've learned that we need
to define the data types

13
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.790 
and this could be done
either on the table

14
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.560 
or a much faster way is if you know
that all of these are number

15
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.810 
types, you can also select
them open the attributes bar

16
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.280 
and set the data type to number.
Then all data types are number.

17
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.130 
What we can do now is

18
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.300 
we can use an expression to
calculate the final output.

19
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.450 
We could say instead of using the
input directly I've clicked

20
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.890 
into the name or the
header of the input

21
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.150 
type and the equal sign. And
the equal sign allows us to

22
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.620 
yeah to write an expression
actually. And this could be

23
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.440 
the calculation. So we want to use
the cost per units as a variable

24
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.080 
multiplied with
the unit.

25
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.770 
I would like to set a full screen so
that can see the entire expression.

26
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.250 
And multiplied with a discount but
since we provide the discount as

27
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.200 
zero point two for example four
twenty percent discount we need to

28
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.080 
use the expression or you'd
use a formula one minus

29
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.990 
the calculated or the
provided value.

30
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.250 
What happens now is before applying
any rule the decision table

31
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.310 
to calculate the value cost
per unit multiplied by units

32
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.520 
multiplied with a discount
and now we can set the rule

33
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.230 
on the calculated value. The
value itself for now is visible

34
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.820 
but we could say if
the calculated value

35
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.950 
is for example
greater or equal to

36
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.720 
five hundred

37
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.280 
our output could be
accept the order.

38
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.580 
Order check and one output
could be accept the order

39
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.080 
reject the order

40
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.830 
and in that case
we could say

41
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.130 
we accept the order. If the
value is below five hundred

42
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.620 
then we could even say

43
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.280 
we reject the order in terms of
we need the customer need to

44
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.180 
reach a minimum amount for example
then we could say sorry you didn't

45
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.040 
he didn't met the minimum
requirements. Therefore we need

46
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.300 
to be or the order
is not valid.

47
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.030 
The other inputs are not needed here.
Therefore we can delete the column

48
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.660 
and even if we do if we have defined
them as an input we don't need

49
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.880 
the column itself. We only need to
input for calculation purposes.

50
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.030 
The system wants us to provide
the values let's say we have

51
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.770 
ten euro as a cost per unit and
we want to order fifty units.

52
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.880 
Then still everything is possible
it depends on the amount

53
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.690 
of discount if we reach the
five hundred limit or not.

54
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.710 
Let's say we want
to provide

55
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.660 
twenty percent
discount.

56
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.790 
Then it leads to reject
the order. Why?

57
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.470 
Because we are lower than five
hundred. So let's say we

58
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.740 
have seven hundred that
leads to accept the order.

59
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.580 
The problem is that we do not see
what the calculated value is.

60
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.770 
The value is behind or is
calculated behind the expression

61
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.680 
but we cannot see the
actual calculated

62
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.580 
value. We can only see the result
of the decision. Therefore

63
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.910 
there's another way of
providing output.

64
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.960 
You can also use different output
columns and it makes totally

65
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.520 
sense in that case because we want to
show what the calculated value is.

66
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.620 
So the decision can have multiple
inputs and a decision can also have

67
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.380 
multiple-output. To add an output
column we need to click on

68
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.480 
the small oh this
small arrow here.

69
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.200 
And add an
output column

70
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.100 
which is ok
related value.

71
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.480 
This is of course
a number.

72
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.290 
I would even say it's not only
a number it's also a currency

73
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.620 
it's a value behind
for example in euro.

74
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.970 
And what we want to do here is we
want to define here is simply

75
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.540 
the same expression as we have used to
calculate the value before in the

76
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.610 
input header. So this is
what I want to copy here.

77
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.270 
Click on the double click on the in
the cell, put in the equal sign,

78
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.760 
copy the formula,

79
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.070 
and of course we want to see also
the the same result when we

80
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.170 
or the same value when we reject the
order because we want to know why

81
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.120 
the other will
be rejected.

82
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.160 
Click on apply and
simulate again.

83
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.740 
The two results that possible because
we didn't have provided any input yet

84
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.580 
accepting or reject order and we can
see at the second output column

85
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.790 
has a star included which means
there's a value but the

86
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.920 
value couldn't be calculated yet
because there are no inputs.

87
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.880 
So let's do the same.

88
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.550 
Input of or a discount
of zero point two

89
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.380 
and seven hundred units we want to
order leads to the calculated

90
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.210 
value of five thousand
six hundred euro.

91
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.300 
Therefore we can
accept the order.

92
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.500 
What would happen if we would
have only five or fifty units?

93
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.630 
It would lead to the four hundred
euro therefore we need to reject

94
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.390 
the order because the rule is
everything below five hundred

95
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.890 
need to reject.

96
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.910 
This is a simple way to use expressions.
So inputs cannot only be used to

97
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.290 
to write it with and and
if then conditional if

98
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.590 
then business we can also be used to
calculate or have a calculation

99
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.210 
purposes and provide one
single output. But sometimes

100
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.380 
as I mentioned it makes sense to
provide the calculated value

101
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.500 
in order to have a reasonable explanation
why we come to that result.

102
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.120 
Expressions are quite powerful.
It's not only all about

103
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.510 
calculations you can you can even
use it for complex scenarios.

104
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.200 
The DMN notation provide a lot of different
expressions coming from the field

105
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.750 
notation which has a
dedicated notation to

106
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.650 
I would say described logic which
cannot not be expressed only by

107
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.470 
simple business rules

108
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.390 
and I want to show in a complex
example where yeah which

109
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.170 
which contains a lot of
different calculations.

110
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.550 
These expressions can also be used for
complex scenarios in the decision modeling.

111
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.850 
For example this model shows
or determines when the next

112
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.500 
material needs to be
ordered depending on the

113
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.130 
consumption per day on the
current amount we have in stock

114
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.580 
in the manufacturing
scenario

115
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.280 
on the minimum stock when we need
to order new material because

116
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.280 
we have a minimum level

117
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.360 
and the desired
order quantity.

118
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.900 
You can imagine that with
these four inputs does have

119
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:46.600 
a lot of influence was yeah influences
a lot of different decisions because

120
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.050 
the order quantity for example
determines the type of supplier

121
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.570 
and suppliersinfluences
the delivery time.

122
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.870 
We order for example
four hundred

123
00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.500 
units. Then we could meet
special conditions we need to

124
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.480 
choose supplier A and supply A has
the delivery time of for example

125
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.700 
four days instead of seven
like the other suppliers.

126
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.100 
It's also important that the the
predictive date in the future

127
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.960 
when the next order needs to be
triggered is not on the weekend.

128
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.170 
So we need to consider
that the day

129
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.400 
is a working day because
someone needs to order it,

130
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.590 
needs to trigger the order and
therefore needs to be there

131
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.510 
from monday to friday.

132
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.380 
This is a more complex example and I
would like to show you in practice

133
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.420 
how it looks like when
I start a simulation.

134
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.940 
We have only four
inputs here.

135
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.680 
The system is telling me that the
decision cannot be evaluated

136
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.120 
because we didn't provide any input yet
but it is required for calculation.

137
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.180 
Therefore we could say what happen
if we have a daily consumption

138
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.360 
of material of
ten pieces.

139
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.940 
We have the current amount in stock
of I would say a thousand a

140
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:13.070 
yes thousand items we can still
use. But we need to order and

141
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.320 
reach the minimum level
of five hundred

142
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.170 
to make sure that we are still
get the next order in time.

143
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.820 
And we want to order

144
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.770 
thousand additional
pieces.

145
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.680 
Then the system tells me okay with these
conditions the order can be triggered

146
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:38.320 
but it's fine if we all are on the
on the twenty fourth of april

147
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.640 
the presumed delivery
delivery date would be the

148
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.110 
the second of may. And we
are still in deviation to

149
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.170 
to the maximum stock capacity
when it's gone down a bit we

150
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.360 
could see there's a stock
capacity of two thousand

151
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.330 
but it's not met. We
have still capacity

152
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.530 
by eighty so we can even
say we want to order

153
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.800 
one thousand eighty.

154
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.100 
It can still be triggered, it's the
working day everything is fine

155
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.880 
and with this conditions we
are we are on the safe side

156
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.120 
that we that we can on the one
hand we can trigger the order

157
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.910 
on the other hand we have the
perfect amount of pieces

158
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.230 
to order to reach the
maximum stock capacity.

159
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.860 
And when we consider the day of
delivery to daily consumption

160
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.420 
we are still on
the safe side.

161
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.300 
What would happen if we

162
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:38.500 
if we say we have not thousand stock
we have only five hundred stock

163
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.300 
then we need to order today
because it's quite critical we

164
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.320 
already reached the minimum stock
we need to order today so

165
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.640 
the delivery date would
be the twenty first.

166
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:53.410 
And this is a very good example how we
can use decision models. Everybody

167
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.510 
everything which can be calculated and can
be potentially used in decision models.

168
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.960 
When we scroll down a bit you can
see that it's a very complex

169
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:08.590 
model only four inputs but a lot of decisions
which use calculations and expressions

170
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.510 
for example when I scroll
down a bit here we can see

171
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.750 
that but here for example
expression is used

172
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.710 
which adds a day. If we for
example if the order will be

173
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.710 
or the future date will be on sunday
then this expression adds a day

174
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.450 
to reach the working
day to say hey then

175
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.820 
please put the
order on monday.

176
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.250 
Even here we have calculations
also a day at and

177
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.450 
here we set a stock level on day
of delivery minus the minimum

178
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.880 
stock level and so on.
So we can use really

179
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.610 
all your inputs to calculate
them each other in order to

180
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:55.220 
to provide a date or a calculated
value total sum whatever is needed.

181
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.930 
So that

182
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.540 
concludes basically the last
video advanced decision logic.

183
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.540 
So you can use FEEL expressions
for calculation purposes you

184
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.680 
can even build advanced
decision models and

185
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.730 
it can be as complex as it
needs. It can only be the case

186
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.460 
but it can also be the
case that only one

187
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.490 
date will be provided
the end but

188
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.910 
you see in simulation for example
only the prognostic date but not

189
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.460 
the entire complex decision
logic for example.

190
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.110 
So FEEL is a quite
powerful notation

191
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.760 
which yeah can be used
for various scenarios.

192
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.130 
At this point I'd like to summarize what
we have learned in week number five.

193
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.690 
We had taken a look into process modelling
by using Signavio process manager

194
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:52.770 
and the editor. We had used the Signavio QuickModel
to capture all process relevant information.

195
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.780 
We have taken a look into
process analysis possibilities

196
00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.470 
like simulation and worked
with different scenarios.

197
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.920 
We've learned how to create
decision models and also

198
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.940 
verify decision logic, simulate
and testing decision models

199
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.960 
and you get a look an outlook
into the future and work with

200
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.600 
how to work with even more
complex decision logic

201
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.660 
like FEEL expressions in order to create
more complex decision diagrams.

202
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.530 
So that rounds up all
that we have learnt in

203
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.030 
week number five. Thank
you for attending.

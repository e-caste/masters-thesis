00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.180 
Ladies and gentlemen, Iâ€™d like to
welcome you to the openHPI

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.070 
course on business process
modeling and analysis.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.030 
In this week I will be introducing
business process management.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.300 
This week has seven
lecture videos.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.930 
In the first lecture video I will
be defining business processes.

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.150 
The second one is about
modeling because our cause is

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.090 
about business process modeling
and analysis. I'd like to expand

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.770 
a little bit on modeling in general
and also discuss a little

9
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.090 
bit of modeling theory.

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.030 
After that we will be looking
at business process models to

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100 
apply what we learned from modeling
theory to process models.

12
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.140 
In lecture video 1.4  we
will be looking at interacting

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
business processes or processes that
interact with other business processes.

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.810 
This topic will be discussed
in detail in week six.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.260 
In lecture video 1.5
we look at models and instances.

16
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.320 
Each business process model has
a number of process instances.

17
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.080 
We will be covering
these topics.

18
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.470 
In 1.6 we look at
different levels of process models

19
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.340 
and finally we introduce the
business process life cycle in

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.800 
video 1.7.

21
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.150 
So I like to come back to my
introductory video that most of you

22
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.930 
will have seen, maybe sometime
ago already where I mentioned

23
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.040 
that we are all involved in
business processes, as clients we

24
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.890 
trigger business processes and as professionals
we participate in business processes.

25
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.980 
We had a number of examples on this
slide and I like to focus on

26
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.290 
the submission of an insurance
claims or when for instance

27
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.840 
our bike has been stolen we fill
out an insurance claim, we

28
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.210 
send the insurance claim to our
insurance company. In the insurance

29
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.130 
company there are professionals
who are in charge of handling

30
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.180 
these insurance claim. So for instance
people would check whether

31
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.460 
the theft of my bike is actually
covered by my insurance.

32
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.600 
We always try to be very
visual. So we try to

33
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.950 
use, let's say, graphics to
specify what are the

34
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.090 
parts of business process, what are
the players in business processes,

35
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.480 
how do the players
interact and in this first example

36
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.830 
we represent participants and
the flow of messages between

37
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.090 
the participants. On the insurance
example we have the client

38
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.480 
we have the client that is
represented by these upper box and

39
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.830 
we have the insurance company
represented by this box in

40
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.360 
the lower part of the slide and
we also have a message flow

41
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.500 
between them so we see here that there
is a flow of mass of a message

42
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.400 
from the client to the
insurance company.

43
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.920 
And there are two additional
Messages, one is from the insurance

44
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.490 
company to the client which is
called letter of approval. So

45
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.980 
the letter of approval might be sent there
and also the letter of rejection

46
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.350 
is sent from the insurance
companies of the client.

47
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.440 
So this very simple visual
representation shows quite well

48
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the parties that are involved and how
these parties interact using messages.

49
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.380 
However it's far from being a complete
process specification because for instance

50
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.610 
we see only the potential
flow of messages. So either

51
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.490 
the insurance company would send
a letter of approval or the

52
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.220 
insurance company would send a
letter of rejection but not

53
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.960 
both at the same time but this
information is not reflected in this

54
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.230 
visual representation in these
first model that we be looking

55
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.630 
At. So we will need to have
a bit more detail there.

56
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.100 
In the introductory video I also
talked about the role of business

57
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.280 
processes for companies. So companies
and public administrations

58
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.070 
provide services and products to their
clients by enacting business processes.

59
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.060 
And business processes are at the
core of organizations and therefore

60
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.090 
an important success factor. I also
mentioned that people are the key to

61
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.640 
business processes and we had a
number of roles that we were

62
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.520 
discussing in the
introductory

63
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.120 
video. So we have the
process participants.

64
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.660 
These are the domain experts for
instance working in insurance

65
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.810 
our company but also in public
administration or in finance.

66
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.240 
The process owners are domain experts as
Well. They have a management position

67
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.070 
maybe the chair of the department

68
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.760 
would be an example position
of a process owner. They

69
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.450 
often have a business
background.

70
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.990 
Then in several and many process
management projects we see

71
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.610 
business process management
consultants, these are the

72
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.140 
real process experts they have a
business background or an IT

73
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.950 
background both is with both let's
say backgrounds here for this

74
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.570 
Roles. And finally when it comes to
an automating business process

75
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.270 
to implementing business process
in IT software architects

76
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.070 
and also developers
are involved.

77
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.530 
So we see these different roles and when
you look at the people, when you

78
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.990 
also think about on people in
your organization that fill

79
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.680 
these roles, these people use a
different technical terminology.

80
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.360 
We can even say that the people
might even speak different languages.

81
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.640 
However when we want to achieve
something, when we want to create

82
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.320 
good business process, when we want to
implement a good business process -

83
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.350 
all these people play important
roles. All these people should

84
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.010 
be involved, all these people should
come to a common understanding.

85
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.380 
So in process documentation, process improvement,
process automation, process monitoring

86
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.960 
it's important to have a global
on some common language that

87
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.780 
other people could use and this
language is process models

88
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.730 
and this is why process modeling
is in the heart or the core

89
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.680 
of this course.

90
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.610 
So it's time to look at what the
business process actually is.

91
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.310 
Business process consists of a set of
activities that are performed

92
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.120 
in coordination in an organizational
and technical environment.

93
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.210 
And these activities jointly
realize a business goal.

94
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.860 
The lower part of this slide we
have a business process model

95
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.070 
of the insurance claim process
I was already discussing.

96
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.820 
So I'd like to
highlight some of the

97
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.590 
elements here. So the definition
says we have a set of activities

98
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:25.590 
that are performed in coordination
and organization and technical environment.

99
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.950 
To start with a set of activities -
well set of activities is quite

100
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.820 
Simple. We have here activities - register
Claim, decide on claim coverage,

101
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.740 
prepare letter of approval and
prepare a letter of rejection.

102
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.600 
These activities are not independently
independent from each other.

103
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.830 
These activities are
performed in coordination

104
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.470 
in performed in coordination and
the coordination is here mainly

105
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.700 
defined by the ordering in which
things happens. The first

106
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.780 
thing that happens -
claim is received.

107
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.710 
Once the claim is received activity
register claim is executed.

108
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.950 
Once the claim is registered we need
to decide on the claim coverage.

109
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.390 
After we decide on the claim
coverage two different things

110
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.970 
can happen. Either we prepare the
letter of approval or we prepare

111
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.750 
the letter of rejection. And
finally either approval is sent

112
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.580 
or the claim is
rejected.

113
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.260 
So that's an introductory example
of a business process and

114
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.560 
we also see that all these activities
jointly realize the business goal.

115
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.670 
And in both cases when the claim
is achieved or is approved

116
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.100 
or the claim is rejected in both
cases and the business goal

117
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.870 
of the insurance
companies are fulfilled.

118
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.400 
Alright, related to the
scoping of business

119
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.130 
processes each business process is
enacted by a single organization

120
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.770 
but it may interact with business processes
performed by other organizations.

121
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.740 
So the scope of a process is always
an organization that's important to

122
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:06.450 
Remember.

123
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.120 
Right on in the lower part you see
the process we have just been

124
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:19.190 
Discussing. So this is a business process
that runs inside of the insurance company.

125
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.930 
But we also have
in the upper part

126
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.850 
another role which
is a client.

127
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.360 
And the client also runs might run
internally a business process

128
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.620 
where the activity one activity
is filling out the insurance

129
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.330 
claim for another activity would be
sending out the insurance claim

130
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.910 
for other activities would be then
receiving either the letter of

131
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.810 
approval or the
letter of rejection.

132
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.450 
So we can add the client to these
and we have now an interaction

133
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.330 
that means here we have a flow of message
similar to the one we've seen before.

134
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.800 
So the client sends the claim
to the insurance company and the

135
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.380 
claim is received. On receiving the
claim the insurance company's

136
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.940 
bonds creates a new process
instance, creates a new

137
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.770 
process instance to
handle this case.

138
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.610 
And here we also have claim approved
that is a sent message and here

139
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.980 
we also have message
flow from the

140
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.540 
insurance company back to the client and here
we see that we have alternative either

141
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.810 
the letter of approval is sent
or the letter of rejection is sent.

142
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.890 
The point I'd like to make here is
that the scope of a business process

143
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.410 
as a single organizations that
when I use the highlighter to

144
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.480 
scope what the business
processes its

145
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.880 
let's say a set of activities
that are performed in coordination,

146
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.290 
organization and technical setting
that might communicate

147
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.520 
with business process of other
organization which is a client

148
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.350 
in this case.

149
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.010 
Business process management
is a broader let's say the

150
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.800 
broader area that business process
modeling and analysis lives within.

151
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:17.150 
Business process management includes
concepts methods and techniques to support

152
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:23.460 
the design administration configuration
enactment and analysis of business processes.

153
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.170 
So

154
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.450 
let's look at the different
terms that have been used here.

155
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:37.000 
So design, administration, configuration
enactment and analysis.

156
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.990 
You see here the business
process model and

157
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.060 
well people need to work
together to come up with this

158
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.160 
Model, need to design the model, we
need to register models, we need to

159
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:56.480 
configure the models to make it
executable. We also look at

160
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.670 
enactment of
the process.

161
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.150 
Let's say the process needs to be
then enacted in the organization

162
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.710 
and technical setting and also
needs to be analyzed with respect

163
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.930 
to former properties or with respect
to performance properties.

164
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.130 
So this is a whole area of
business process management that

165
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.180 
let's say provides the largest
scope and we look at  business

166
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.250 
process modeling and analysis
which is a subset of this area.

167
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:31.090 
Ok so what is  business process or what
is described by business processes?

168
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.130 
Well business processes describe the
execution ordering of activities

169
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.370 
and their interactions with
partners. They do not describe the

170
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.520 
actual implementation
of the activities or

171
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.400 
the actual implementation of the
in-teractions nor  the way

172
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.180 
the coordination is achieved. So
when we have a business process

173
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.130 
like the one
we've seen here

174
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:59.410 
we do not specify in which way the
insurance claim is sent from the

175
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.050 
client to the insurance company.
This is not specified, this

176
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.520 
specifies that there is a message
flowing from the client to

177
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.010 
the insurance company. We don't say
how that is technically performed.

178
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:16.830 
It can be by letter, it can be
by fax message, it can be by

179
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.050 
Email, it can also be by using
a web form for instance.

180
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.960 
The same holds of course for the
message flow in the other direction.

181
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.970 
But we also just say from a semantic
point of view the activities

182
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.370 
are specified by their
labels or register claim.

183
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.910 
How register claim is executed
is then up tool lets say the

184
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.800 
implementation in the configuration
phase. So we are not prescribing

185
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.900 
things therefore a common
understanding of the

186
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.380 
process model but also the labels
used here is essential and

187
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.380 
here we have the
other activities.

188
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.400 
A business process management
system is a generic software

189
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.130 
system that is driven by explicit
process representation to

190
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.530 
coordinate the enactment
of business processes.

191
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.200 
So the coordination can be achieved
in quite a flexible way by a

192
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.970 
BPMS Business Process
Management System.

193
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.630 
So what does this type of
system do is the following -

194
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:27.110 
the BPMS gets
or receives

195
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.670 
the process model with execution
information attached to that and then

196
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.480 
interprets it during
runtime for instance.

197
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.160 
So it makes sure that the activities
as specified in the process

198
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.870 
model are actually
executed in the same order and

199
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.840 
in the same execution constraints
which means branching

200
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.660 
specified by this model.

201
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.800 
So I wanted to introduce the
term process orchestration and

202
00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.060 
we are now able to do that so a
business process management system

203
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.630 
acts as a central agent that controls
the execution of process activities.

204
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.020 
This ensures the coordination of activities
as defined by the process model

205
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.350 
and that is quite
similar to a conductor

206
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.030 
that centrally controls the
musician and orchestra.

207
00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:25.410 
So here there might be the BPMS
maybe I
can also sketch

208
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.450 
that a little bit here
might be the BPMS

209
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.360 
and the BPMS essential
coordinating

210
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:41.810 
Instance. And that is okay, their
claim has been received. The

211
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.480 
first thing that needs to be
done is the claim needs to be

212
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.960 
Registered. Once the
claim is registered

213
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.550 
we need to decide on the claim
coverage. After that we need

214
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.070 
to do a decision. We need to either
prepare letter of approval

215
00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.480 
or prepare letter of rejection
and finally we need to send out

216
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:07.180 
on the respect of letters. This is the central
agency that coordinates or orchestrates

217
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.080 
the process and this is where the term
process orchestration comes from.

218
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.850 
Alright this concludes the
first video clip - video clip

219
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.420 
1.1. What did we
discuss in this video clip? We

220
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.060 
took a look at business processes,
what are the elements of

221
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.160 
business processes, what is the
scope of business processes,

222
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.470 
we discuss the interaction
of business processes,

223
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.690 
we took a look at the broader area
of business process management,

224
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.850 
discussed briefly business what
a business process management

225
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.460 
system does and finally we took a
look at process orchestration.

226
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.170 
That concludes video-clip
1.1.

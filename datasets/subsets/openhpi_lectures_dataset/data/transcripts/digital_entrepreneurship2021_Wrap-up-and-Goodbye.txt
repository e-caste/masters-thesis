00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.360 
So, this is it! You did it, we
did it. 4 weeks of intensive

2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500 
studying and learning and
discovering new things

3
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.540 
are coming to an end. We're a little
sad to let you go, hopefully,

4
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.330 
you're a little sad as well. We hope
you took something from this class.

5
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
We hope that you learn that
entrepreneurship is not black

6
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.200 
or white, yes or no. It is pretty
complex, it comes with a lot

7
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.740 
of different
shades of grey.

8
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.540 
We hope we could
provide you with a

9
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.420 
little insight into the depth and
the details of entrepreneurship.

10
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070 
If you are further interested,
we updated our reference list,

11
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.640 
we added some more key references, so
feel free to look into these readings.

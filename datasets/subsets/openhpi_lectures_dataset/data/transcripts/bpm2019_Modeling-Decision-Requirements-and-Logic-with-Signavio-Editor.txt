00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.030 
Welcome to our tutorial on the
signavio decision manager.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.460 
This week's lectures will focus on decision
management and decision modelling

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.200 
and we encourage you to deepen
your knowledge by applying it.

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.450 
So similar to our tutorial on modeling
business processes with the

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.340 
Signavio process editor I will now
show you how to model decisions

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.620 
using the signavio
decision manager.

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.670 
To use the decision manager
you log into the Signavio

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.300 
platform as usual at
academic.signavio.com or

9
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
editor.signavio.com

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.030 
and there you
will see the

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.670 
Signavio platform you already know
the basic layout of that platform

12
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.410 
and now to create decision
models you select

13
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.460 
from over here
from this list

14
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.330 
a business decision diagram which essentially
is a decision model according to

15
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.820 
DMN 1.0.

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.210 
Right, so a decision model
essentially consists of two levels

17
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.340 
as you will learn in
lecture videos 6.2

18
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.340 
the decision requirements level
and the decision logic level.

19
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.240 
The decision requirements
level shows the structure of

20
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.950 
the decision so what is necessary
to make the decision. And

21
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.390 
to create such a requirements diagram
I will take an example from a

22
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.300 
the lecture also video 6.2
which is a decision about

23
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.160 
covering an insurance claim that a
customer can make after for example

24
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.230 
a bike theft occurred.

25
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.930 
Right so to model such a diagram you
can use the elements over here

26
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.010 
and similar to when you model
business processes also here

27
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.130 
you have the possibility of
selecting from a different number

28
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.690 
of elements. So for
example you could use

29
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.410 
the core elements of DMN
but you can also use a

30
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.620 
a more complete list of elements.
But for our purposes now the

31
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.400 
core elements are
sufficient.

32
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.920 
Right so usually when modeling
requirements diagram we

33
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.210 
start with modeling the top-level
decision. So we take this

34
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.030 
decision element and drag it
onto the modelling page.

35
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
Then we can also give it a name
which in our cases decide on

36
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.030 
claim coverage.

37
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
Right so in the end this
decision will tell us whether

38
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.840 
or not to accept a
coverage claim.

39
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.310 
And of course to be able to make
this decision we need some

40
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.750 
input data on which this
decision can be based

41
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.100 
and we can model this by either selecting
the input data elements from over here

42
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.460 
and connecting it
to the decision

43
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.510 
or we can

44
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.630 
select the decision element
directly and then

45
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.950 
the input data element that is displayed
next to it and then this way

46
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.670 
the input data element is directly
connected to the decision element.

47
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.570 
Alright let's say that we have
three input data elements.

48
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.340 
Of course we'd also like to
give them names so the first

49
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.870 
input comes from a claimed data
object. And now this claim is

50
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.240 
a complex data object but I'm only
interested in certain attributes

51
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.340 
of that object so what I can
do is I say claim.value

52
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.670 
and by this I express that I am
interested in the attribute

53
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.090 
called value of that
claim data object.

54
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.420 
Similarly I say that

55
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.790 
I want to use the attribute theft
time of this data object and then

56
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.330 
finally I use a another
data object called

57
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.440 
customer contract and of that
object I want to use the type

58
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.830 
of the contracts. So

59
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.010 
depending on the type of
the customer contract

60
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.390 
the claims are handled
differently.

61
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.960 
Finally we need to specify
the types of these input

62
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.360 
data objects. So for example the
value of the claim will be some

63
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.590 
kind of number and we need to
specify this and to do this we

64
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.520 
selected and then from the right hand
side of the editor we can open the

65
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.370 
the attributes pane.

66
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.830 
Here you can set various attributes
of the selected element

67
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.560 
for example its name or its colour
and right now we want to set

68
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.920 
the type or domain of the
element. And by default its

69
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.630 
text but we wanted
to be a number.

70
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.480 
And then this number
can also have unit -

71
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.250 
in our case it's currency and then
we have the currency unit Euros.

72
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.340 
Similarly we say that the
theft time also is a number

73
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.370 
and the customer contract
now will be an

74
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.150 
will be an enumeration,

75
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
meaning that here under items
we can enumerate all possible

76
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.290 
values that this variable can
take on in our case that's gold

77
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.250 
so they can be gold's customers
and standard customers.

78
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.610 
So this completes requirements
level of our decision

79
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.540 
model we can now see what inputs are
necessary to make the decision.

80
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.030 
Now the concrete decision logic still
needs to be specified for each

81
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.860 
decision or that requirements diagram
we only have one decision right now

82
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.350 
for which we need to
specify the logic

83
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.610 
and we can do this by

84
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.410 
clicking on this small
table icon over here,

85
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.930 
then a window
will pop up.

86
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.540 
And here we have various ways of
specifying the decision logic

87
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.590 
either a decision table but there
are also other options we

88
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.140 
can click on literal expression
over here and then we can for

89
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.010 
example just type in

90
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.660 
arbitrary text that in some way describes
how the decision should be taken.

91
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.590 
We can also pursue a more
formal approach by saying

92
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.450 
expression here then we have
this equation text box

93
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.080 
in which we can use the
variables that we just define

94
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.680 
the input variables but we can
also use predefined functions.

95
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.760 
Finally this link option here
enables you to link your

96
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.790 
your decision to already existing
decision models that you

97
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.080 
may have created beforehand
and that you can a reuse for

98
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.120 
your current
decision model.

99
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.480 
But since we haven't defined anything
yet we are going to do this

100
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.220 
with the use of a
decision table.

101
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.950 
Right so you can see the skeleton
of the decision table.

102
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.300 
It consists of columns one
column for each input and

103
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.450 
a column for the output. The
columns, the input columns already

104
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.640 
have names and types for the
inputs but for the output column

105
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.520 
we still need to specify the name
and let's just call it output

106
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.850 
and its type will be

107
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.430 
an enumeration with
possible values yes

108
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.220 
and no. So saying that
the output says yes the

109
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.330 
claim is accepted or no
it's not accepted.

110
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.030 
Alright so let's add some rules.
Basically a rule consists

111
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.650 
of cells; one cell for
each input and one cell

112
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.290 
for the output and each cell
can have an operator which we

113
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.440 
can select by double
clicking on the

114
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.540 
leftmost area of the cell. Here we
have a bunch of operators and

115
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.740 
it can have a value that we can
specify a double clicking on the

116
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:52.050 
right area of the cell. So
for example if we want to

117
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.310 
express that all claims that are
below two hundred euros are

118
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.850 
accepted independent of the time
of the theft and the type of the

119
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.500 
contract then
we would say

120
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.350 
we need the
operator less,

121
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.240 
type in the value
two hundred

122
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:17.400 
and just select yes from this list
here. Right so this says that

123
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.470 
if the claim value is less
than two hundred euros and

124
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.250 
any theft time is possible here and
any contract type is possible

125
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.120 
then we say we output yes
the the claim is accepted.

126
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:39.420 
Right so let's add another rule
for values of claims that are

127
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.410 
between two and five hundred
euros. We do this by

128
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.910 
now choosing the
operator included

129
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.530 
and typing in
the interval

130
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.050 
two hundred to
five hundred

131
00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:00.860 
like this. Again we leave
open the theft time but

132
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.900 
we say that the type of
contract must be gold. So it

133
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.760 
must be a gold customer in order for
the claim to be accepted, right.

134
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.430 
But what about

135
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.230 
what about standard customers?
Let's add another rule.

136
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.270 
What about standard
customers, where the

137
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.700 
claim values between two and
five hundred euros, between

138
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.600 
two hundred and five hundred. Well
here we say that in this case

139
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.240 
the time of the theft
must be between

140
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.480 
six am and ten pm.

141
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.080 
Right and also in
this case the

142
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.750 
the claim is accepted.

143
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.850 
Alright let's now
complete the table by

144
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.950 
adding a rule for values that are higher
than greater than five hundred.

145
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.480 
So we take the greater operator,
type in five hundred,

146
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.850 
and now we would say

147
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.590 
the time of theft
must be between

148
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:15.490 
six am and ten pm and a type of
the contract must be for gold

149
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.260 
customers in order for the
claim to be accepted. So

150
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.880 
if the customer is a standard
customer and the claim

151
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.610 
value is higher than five hundred
then we will reject it, so

152
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.700 
there's no way that a standard customer
claims are accepted in this case.

153
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.460 
So we would at this final rule
saying that and I will leave empty

154
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:44.110 
every cell saying that in all other
cases the claim is rejected.

155
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:53.320 
Right what we can now do is click
on this verify button over here

156
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.960 
and this will check various
properties of the table as

157
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.230 
you will also learn in
video clips 6.5 and 6.6.

158
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.340 
Let's do this. So here
we can see that

159
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.070 
we have a lot of errors
after this check

160
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.750 
because of overlapping rules. So
for example this error says that

161
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.240 
rules one and five overlap
because they both apply for

162
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.600 
the input where
the claims below

163
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.540 
two hundred euros we have
any theft time in any

164
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.390 
contract type. And this makes sense,
right. So here we have less

165
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.310 
than two hundred any
time any type and also

166
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.880 
here we can have a values less
than two hundred and any time

167
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.800 
in any type, right. So

168
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.550 
both rules apply for the same
input combinations and that's

169
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.790 
uh what this check is
complaining about.

170
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.370 
So what happened? Did we model
the table incorrectly?

171
00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:00.160 
Not necessarily. It depends on
the hit policy of the table.

172
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.100 
You will learn about hit
policies of decision tables in

173
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:10.320 
a video clip 6.5 and right now the
table has the hit policy unique

174
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:16.110 
as denoted by this letter U
over over here. The unique

175
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.730 
policy says that

176
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.950 
each rule of the table must be
unique so there must not be any

177
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.780 
overlap between the rules and
apparently this is or obviously

178
00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.650 
this is not the case here so
what we can now do is we

179
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.980 
can click on this letter and
just change the hit policy to

180
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:42.640 
first. This says that it's ok that
there is overlap between rules

181
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.710 
and if we have an input
combination where

182
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.480 
more than one rule applies then we just
take the first rule that matches. So

183
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.520 
then in this case the
first rule would just be

184
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.080 
used to produce
the output.

185
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:05.330 
So we can again execute this
verification test here and then

186
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.400 
everything's fine because we
changed the hit policy.

187
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.930 
Alright so this completes
the decision model we have

188
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.130 
now defined requirements diagram
and also the logic for

189
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.040 
the decision we can now change
this diagram. Let's call it

190
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.210 
claim decision.

191
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.370 
This decision model now

192
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.500 
should be called from a
process right. We have a

193
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.720 
process in mind that someone
needs to make a decision and

194
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.970 
this decision now should be made
according to this decision

195
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.640 
model. But of course to do this
we need to link the decision

196
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.020 
to some process model. And this
is what we're going to do now.

197
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.140 
Let's just move this

198
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.660 
model that we just
created to this folder.

199
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:11.420 
So I already prepared a process
model called claim process. This

200
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.480 
is also the process model that
you see and video clip 6.2

201
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.400 
it's called claim
process, so

202
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.250 
and well this is just the process for
handling the insurance claims, right.

203
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.060 
Here the claim is received
it's registered and then at

204
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.580 
some point we have this business
rule task which you can see

205
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.950 
because of this small table I can
hear it's a business rule task.

206
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.290 
This task is supposed to
produce the output that

207
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.820 
then can be determined
whether to

208
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.930 
accept the claim or
reject the claim.

209
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:56.210 
Okay so this task now is not supposed
to itself implement the decision but

210
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.980 
it should be linked to the
decision model that we

211
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.650 
just created. So what I do is I click
this small table icon over here

212
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:10.270 
and this way I can establish
a link to a decision model.

213
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.270 
So I use an existing
diagram here and

214
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.120 
just select the diagram
that I just created

215
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.240 
and then whenever I again click
on this table icon here

216
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.170 
I see a small preview of the link
decision model and I can also

217
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.920 
open up the full model.

218
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.990 
Let me now show you a final
feature of the signavio

219
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.080 
decision manager which is the
simulation of decision.

220
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:50.180 
To simulate decisions you select
the simulation view over here

221
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.070 
and then you have a slightly different view
where you can see the requirements diagram,

222
00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.030 
you can see all the possible
inputs that you can provide and

223
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.700 
also the possible outputs and you
can see the decision table.

224
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:11.070 
And what we can do now is we can
test different input combinations

225
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.960 
to the table or to the decision
model and see what outputs

226
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.340 
result from this. So for
example we could say

227
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:23.590 
what if the theft time is two
am, the value of the claim

228
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:28.290 
is four hundred euros and the type
of the contract is standard.

229
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.610 
And we see that the output
that results is no.

230
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.740 
You can also check which rule
is responsible for producing

231
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.260 
this output is the lowest
one rule number five.

232
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.790 
Let's check a slightly
different input what if

233
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.540 
the customer
contract type is

234
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.580 
gold then the output
is yes and this is

235
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.110 
because in this case rule
two fired and produced

236
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.990 
the output yes.

237
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.630 
Right so using the simulation
you can test different

238
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.440 
input combinations to your
decision model and check

239
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.060 
if the result the result is
what you expect it to be.

240
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.150 
This concludes our tutorial on
the Signavio decision manager

241
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.900 
and I hope you enjoy
modeling your decisions.

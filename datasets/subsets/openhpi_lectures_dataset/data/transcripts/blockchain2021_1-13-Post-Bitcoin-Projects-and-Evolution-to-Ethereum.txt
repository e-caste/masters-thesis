1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.640 
We finish our first week of our openHPI
course "Blockchain: Revealing the Myth"

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.360 
with a preview on post bitcoin projects
and the evolution to Ethereum.

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.550 
If we look to what happens after
bitcoin system was involved

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.820 
and the people understood
that there is great

5
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.220 
innovation potential
in the technology

6
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.320 
the detailed description of the bitcoin
concept and its technical implementation

7
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.710 
help the people to build on this
system and to continue to develop it.

8
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.960 
All the bitcoin protocol the
software all is public like in

9
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.110 
an open source system.

10
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.240 
Any developer
around the world

11
00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:01.130 
can review the code, can make his own
modified version of the bitcoin software

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.330 
and really this was done in the
past years so that meanwhile

13
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
we have a lot of different applications
of the blockchain technology

14
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.710 
in many different projects
for many different areas.

15
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.690 
There are two paths

16
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.970 
established for such

17
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.340 
bitcoin projects. The one path was building
on independent blockchain network

18
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.190 
re-starting, taking the idea,
re-starting a new network

19
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.970 
and then doing with this
network some new application.

20
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.450 
And the other pause was building
a solution simply on top

21
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.690 
of bitcoin, on top of
the bitcoin system.

22
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.600 
When we consider the independent block
chain network ideas and projects,

23
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.930 
then that's implementation of such an
independent blockchain based system

24
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.080 
offers of course a greater flexibility.
It is easy to exactly adapt

25
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.190 
to the needs of that application
and there is a great freedom

26
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.830 
in the composition of the desired
functionalities and rules.

27
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.730 
This all can be done by the
designer of this independent

28
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.480 
blockchain
based system

29
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.640 
but at the expense of
the development time

30
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.610 
and in particular
also the security

31
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.000 
every change gives reason
to new failures as

32
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.910 
it is difficult
to establish,

33
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.560 
it is not so easy to
establish such a new network.

34
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.600 
In addition numerous applications
that would make sense to implement

35
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.940 
using blockchain technology
would be too small

36
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.120 
to warrant their
own blockchain.

37
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.210 
It is important we need a
large network so that

38
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.920 
really we can trust in the networks
that the network is not

39
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.560 
jeopardized by malicious
users. And in a new

40
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.410 
upcoming blockchain structure
this is not simple to guarantee.

41
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.130 
So independent blockchain
solutions lack interoperability.

42
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.510 
For many decentralised
applications it would make sense

43
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.320 
if they could interact
with others

44
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.610 
and exactly this brings
us to the second

45
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.230 
approach of such a blockchain based
projects in the past bitcoin time.

46
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.830 
And this is the idea to
work on the top of

47
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.320 
the bitcoin system. This is to
keep the development costs low,

48
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.320 
many developers have decided to
use existing bitcoin system

49
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.200 
and to build on that system
they are individual solutions.

50
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.620 
Since the complexities for mining
and networking are already

51
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.810 
handled by the
bitcoin protocol,

52
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.110 
the most common
mechanisms to realize

53
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.390 
this to realise a new application
on top of the bitcoin system

54
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.400 
is to work with
coloured

55
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.010 
or with meta coins. So they are the
coins the bitcoins that are used

56
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.620 
the network can be used, the
mechanisms can be used, the block

57
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.910 
generation and all those can be
used but the different coins get

58
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.610 
individual meanings and this is

59
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.280 
good understandable by
considering as coloured

60
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.860 
coins - the red ones are usable in
other contexts and the yellow one

61
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.590 
or the blue one means different
things from the grey ones.

62
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.630 
So the purpose of this coloured
coins is to allow people

63
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.580 
to create their own digital currency
or their own digital tokens

64
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.750 
that are represented by a new
value such as a certificate a

65
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.970 
share of a stock, a movie ticket, a
rental apartment or a

66
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.920 
digital key for a house or for a
car on the bitcoin blockchain.

67
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.760 
Each can be
modelized with

68
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.890 
a bitcoin of a
special colour.

69
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.760 
So the principle of
coloured coins involves adding

70
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.310 
to the already available bitcoins
additional information

71
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.620 
available bitcoins are for example
the unspent, the UTXO

72
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.460 
bitcoins and the additional
information the meta data

73
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.350 
here is expressed by
means of a colour.

74
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.100 
Becoming linked to
this information

75
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.190 
the original bitcoins became
coloured get a new meaning

76
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.950 
that is a different semantic than in
the original bitcoin environment.

77
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.460 
And the mechanism recursively
distributes the colour

78
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.330 
to the other UTXO in that context,

79
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.510 
so that in a certain sense there
is a new network of the yellow

80
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.420 
bitcoin owners and the
people that that

81
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:04.510 
transact yellow bitcoin and
there is a new network with brown

82
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.110 
bitcoins.

83
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.180 
So it is to define what is the input,
it is to define what is the output,

84
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.100 
but with a new context than
in the bitcoin context.

85
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.550 
The users who exchange
coloured coins

86
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.840 
to UTXOs use a
coloured coin application

87
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.920 
and know what value and what

88
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:37.890 
property does the coin have. This is important.
They play and use the usual bitcoins

89
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.680 
but they use this in a
different context

90
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.910 
with different
values and properties.

91
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.700 
So they can send them around
like regular bitcoins

92
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.050 
backtracking through the blockchain
to determine the colour of any

93
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.340 
UTXO that they receive so
they can work like in the

94
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.240 
original bitcoin system

95
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:09.920 
in their own world of meaning
and semantic and using all the

96
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.550 
technology provided by
the bitcoin system.

97
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.830 
However we have to be careful.
The blockchain miners

98
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.710 
they cannot recognize
the colour,

99
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.750 
for the miners bitcoins
are bitcoins.

100
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:32.430 
So they do not recognize the
colour of the coloured coins and

101
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.940 
they can see all
incoming transactions

102
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.870 
but merely they can see it as standard
transactions. They cannot see

103
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.610 
whether it is an
transaction of a yellow

104
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.390 
bitcoin in the yellow application
world or whether it's a blue bitcoin

105
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:56.790 
in the blue application world. For this
reason the added information, the meta-data

106
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.110 
must be verified by source who
use the coloured coins.

107
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.860 
All the other things can be done in the
bitcoin world all the other verification

108
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.530 
but the verification of this
new additional property

109
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.690 
that needs to be
done by

110
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.810 
that need to be done by those
who use this coloured bitcoin.

111
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.890 
Meta coins is another approach.
Meta coins can provide

112
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.470 
some, additionally, to the new value, advanced
features that cannot be implemented

113
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.160 
inside of
bitcoin itself.

114
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.470 
So the idea behind of such meta
coins is to have a solution

115
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:49.490 
that lifts on top of bitcoin using bitcoin
transaction, using all the mechanisms

116
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:57.220 
of this peer to peer system to store
their our own meta coin transactions.

117
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.060 
For the bitcoin miner this
transactions still look

118
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.660 
like bitcoin transactions.
They also cannot

119
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.280 
understand that this is something
special, that this are

120
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:17.580 
meta-data. So the miners can't notice if the
meta coin transactions are not valid

121
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.460 
under their own rules. They only check,
the miners only checks the validity

122
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.630 
in the context of the bitcoin system.
So if there are new rules, new

123
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.560 
rules that need to be validated,
then this has to be done by

124
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.590 
those which use
this meta-data.

125
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.310 
The idea with the meta-coins is
to make the possibility of

126
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.080 
simplified payment
verification difficult.

127
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.660 
So only the block header
in the case of light users,

128
00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:01.250 
so here this makes it
difficult or when such post

129
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:08.150 
bitcoin projects are run or light implementations
of bitcoin based meta simulations

130
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:14.030 
relay on a trusted server that provides
the additional data that are

131
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.850 
valid and considered in
these meta coins.

132
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.480 
So here we have our lightweight
users, they have no chance to

133
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:32.240 
understand the application as a project
specific meanings of this meta-data,

134
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.930 
so they completely need

135
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.320 
to trust such trust server.

136
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.900 
And of course when we remember one
of the important thing in this

137
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.920 
in this peer to
peer network

138
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:54.970 
in this bitcoin system was not to
trust any central institution.

139
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:01.540 
So by means of cryptography such a
trusted third party could be eliminated

140
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:08.910 
and here this comeback for such
a meta coin interpretation and others.

141
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.860 
We will go next week in some
examples and to understand it

142
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.210 
better here it's a kind
of preview what happens

143
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.350 
on the basis of the bitcoin
system. Let's look

144
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:31.040 
on the idea of scripting on
top of the bitcoin system.

145
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.930 
You remember the
topic scripting.

146
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.640 
We discussed this when we discussed
how a bitcoin system could

147
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:46.910 
get more flexibility and you
remember that such scripts are

148
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.370 
small programs.

149
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:57.170 
So with the help of such scripts unspent
UTXO can be linked to conditions

150
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.610 
for spending. There are
different scripts for various

151
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.850 
additional use cases. These were
developed and ideas were developed

152
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.820 
in this past bitcoin projects.
To do this however

153
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:21.230 
the scripting language is implemented in
bitcoin has some important limitations.

154
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.800 
This scripting is done on
top of the bitcoin system so

155
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.540 
what what can be done
by the scripts in the

156
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.890 
system is determined by the
bitcoin system itself. So the

157
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.320 
scripting, the creation
of programs

158
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.240 
is limited here in this
on top of this.

159
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.280 
This makes it less flexible
for more complex solutions.

160
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:57.300 
So this is a disadvantage if one only
works on top of the bitcoin system

161
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:05.150 
and one of this important
limitations is that in the bitcoin

162
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.080 
environment for such scripts,
no states are available.

163
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:21.110 
States are important if
you program that systems these are

164
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.370 
we are from this state
moving to that state.

165
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.410 
We can see this
when we look to the

166
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.990 
accounts. Bitcoin system
does not provide account

167
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.460 
like we know it from
the bank system.

168
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.470 
So we cannot simply
see whether there is

169
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.300 
what is on the account what
what bitcoins are available,

170
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:54.860 
they are reconstructed from
this knowledge is to be

171
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.490 
reconstructed from the

172
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.470 
transactions from the
former transactions.

173
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.360 
So it is more about updating the
state of the current ownership

174
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:13.820 
of the coins which
characterize what is an account

175
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.560 
in the bitcoin system.

176
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:22.160 
More precisely whether a bundle
of coins is spent or unspent,

177
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.410 
this can be founed out

178
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:30.170 
in bitcoin but it's not simply
an account that could be seen.

179
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:37.820 
So we only consider UTXOs as
valid coins that can be spent

180
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.540 
and when we look to such
post bitcoin projects, then

181
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.510 
projects on top of the bitcoin
do not provide the opportunity

182
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:56.750 
for multi stage programs or scripts
which keep any other internal stay

183
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.790 
beyond that spent or
unspent information.

184
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.990 
It also means that the UTXO can
only be used by building simple

185
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.630 
one-off programs and not
more complex solutions.

186
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.770 
This is a limitation

187
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:21.620 
arising from the situation that this is
organised on top of the bitcoin system.

188
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.020 
When we look what happened

189
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.610 
with the blockchain technology

190
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:37.150 
behind the bitcoin system, what was
developed in the years after, then

191
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:44.920 
Ethereum is a very important
application of blockchain technology

192
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:52.650 
in a new way. So Ethereum has gone a big
step beyond the usual approaches

193
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:58.060 
tried so far in the
context of the bitcoin system.

194
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:05.510 
So some people speak from the Ethereum
as from the blockchain 2.0

195
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:11.620 
technique. The Ethereum founders have
not attempted to build

196
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.820 
a new UTXO blockchain or
to build a solution on top

197
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.590 
of the existing bitcoin system with
with its limited capabilities but

198
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.180 
simply they merged
these two concepts.

199
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.480 
So Ethereum system enables the
following approaches - building

200
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.190 
a new independent block
chains illusion

201
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:41.680 
on top of an existing blockchain and
using flexible and complex scripts

202
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:48.850 
and building a solution on top of an existing
blockchain with advanced features

203
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.950 
that are not yet implemented within
the existing blockchain. So this

204
00:17:54.150 --> 00:18:01.210 
makes Ethereum a very interesting system
which really provide a step forward

205
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.870 
in the application of the
blockchain technology.

206
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.450 
We will have a much closer look

207
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:16.880 
in the next week. So let's
summarize what we have seen when

208
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.770 
we have looked

209
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:26.390 
to the blockchain solutions which were
initiated by the bitcoin systems.

210
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.330 
Since the concept of the bitcoin system as well
as its technical implementations are public,

211
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:38.890 
many blockchain based projects
and solutions have emerged which

212
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.470 
modified bitcoin
software.

213
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.190 
It was possible to developed either an
independent new blockchain based system

214
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:53.040 
or a one on top of the bitcoin systems,
there are many different projects

215
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.650 
going falling into
this two categories.

216
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.890 
The Ethereum system enables building a
new independent blockchain solution

217
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.860 
on top of an existing blockchain
using flexible and complex

218
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.300 
scripts and building a solution
on top of existing blockchain

219
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.730 
with advanced features and this
shows that the development

220
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.850 
of the blockchain technology
provides a lot more potentials

221
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.640 
that we want to reveal
in the next week.

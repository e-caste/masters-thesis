00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.830 
Welcome to the fifth week
of our OpenHPI course

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.260 
about internet security. this
week, we want to consider the

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.700 
question how to safeguard
communications on the Internet.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.540 
You remember all the communication
partners on the internet are

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.770 
open. so everyone has access
to see what's going on

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.860 
in communication. So all emails
and all the commands for

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.210 
the online shop and
for banks are

8
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.290 
sent over open communication lines.
So without precaution, the attacker

9
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.380 
can read, they can modify, they
can delete the communication

10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.690 
content. In order to
preserve the confidentiality of

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.960 
communication and other
security objectives

12
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.250 
there is the possibility
of encryption. This

13
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.790 
encryption, we can use to protect this
communication. So the attackers

14
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
have access to the data, but as
soon as data are encrypted

15
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.870 
the attackers cannot read and
cannot understand the content.

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.050 
Cryptography is from science,
originated in mathematics and

17
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.190 
now an important field
in computer science.

18
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.100 
But from history, cryptography
already exists since thousands of

19
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
years. So in those days relatively
simple methods for encryption

20
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.850 
were used. Nowadays,
by means of a very

21
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
computationally strong computers
and encryption procedures

22
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.990 
are much more complex in oder
to withstand attacks of

23
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.490 
powerful modern computers. So
our program for course week 5

24
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.770 
is to discuss information
security through cryptography.

25
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.050 
So in this course week, we provide a
basic understanding of cryptography

26
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.410 
and introduce different
encryption techniques.

27
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.120 
So what we will do is to explain in
detail of the basic principles

28
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.040 
of cryptography, we will
discuss symmetric one key

29
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.890 
encryption methods and
asymmetric two key

30
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.870 
encryption methods. The one
key encryption methods are

31
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.470 
also known as secret key
encryptions methods,

32
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.470 
and the two key encryption
methods are often also

33
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.910 
named as public
key encryption.

34
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.850 
On the basis of when we have
understood this different methods of

35
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.210 
encryption, we would also discuss
some popular encryption

36
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.980 
protocols on the internet. Then
we consider security protocols

37
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.940 
to achieve various security objectives,
is not only confidentiality

38
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.680 
what we want to reach,
we also want to

39
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.150 
secure the integrity of the message.
It means that

40
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.690 
one can check whether the
message received by the receiver is

41
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.490 
the same format that it was
sent and to discuss this,

42
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
we will see that the
encryption methods

43
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.080 
can be also applied to reach
these security goals.

44
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.810 
And when we discussed 2-key
or public key encryption

45
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.450 
methods, we need also to speak
about security infrastructures

46
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.790 
that is needed to solve these infrastructures
problem. We will discuss so-called

47
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.990 
PKI's (public key
infrastructures). So it's a

48
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.960 
cool week concentrated on encryption and
what we can do with the encryption

49
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.240 
and of course, we hope you are
interested in this topic and

50
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.540 
you get some new insights
and that you have fun.

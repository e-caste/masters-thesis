00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.570 
We will start our openHPI course
Blockchain: Revealing the Myth

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.600 
with some remarks about
the bitcoin hype.

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.910 
Here in spring 2021

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.870 
the value of
bitcoins is

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.370 
around forty thousand dollar, it comes
close to fifty thousand dollar

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.370 
and this shows a very recent
development. So, for example in

7
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.120 
September 2020,
so a half year ago,

8
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.870 
we measure the value in euro. It
was about nine thousand euro,

9
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.780 
then one month
later it was

10
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.160 
fifty percent more, it was
thirteen thousand euro,

11
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.990 
then one month more it was more
than doubled - it was

12
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.850 
thirty three
thousand euro.

13
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.500 
In february it was forty thousand
euro. We'll see how it continues.

14
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.150 
So bitcoin that's a
new all time high.

15
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.410 
This is not only characteristic for
bitcoin and the bitcoin prices

16
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.720 
which are increasing, it is also
true for other cryptocurrencies.

17
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.540 
So here if you look for example
bitcoin is the most popular one,

18
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.400 
it's more than three hundred
percent. If you look to

19
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.110 
Ethereum this is another very
popular cybercurrency, it's a

20
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
five hundred
percent increase

21
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.170 
and similar also to other
crypto currencies.

22
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.430 
And also the headlines in
the newspaper are full of

23
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.590 
messages about
bitcoin and

24
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.100 
cyber currencies and block-chain.
Here, your two thousand twenty

25
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
one resolution should be buy more
block-chain stocks. Or a surprisingly

26
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.260 
high proportion of all bitcoin
transactions are the result of

27
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.210 
deals or massive black outs have hit Iran.
The government is blaming bitcoin mining.

28
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.470 
So you see all over the world
messages which surprise the

29
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.340 
bitcoin and block-chain and other which
tell that it is a dangerous and connected.

30
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.810 
So if we look for example in Germany,
as there is also skepticism

31
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.920 
against bitcoin so if people were
asked there are some negative voices,

32
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.820 
for example it is too complicated. Two
third of the German citizens think

33
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.520 
following a study which was

34
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.470 
made by bitcoin, two
thirds of German citizens think

35
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.600 
bitcoin and other crypto
currencies are too complicated

36
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.070 
or are only for speculators.

37
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.230 
Almost as many believe crypto
currencies are only suitable

38
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.070 
for a speculators looking
to make a quick profit.

39
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.320 
There are also positive voices
which says it is a safe alternative.

40
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.170 
So three out of ten people which were asked
say that cryptocurrencies are a safe

41
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.410 
alternative to the
established monetary system.

42
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.620 
Among the younger people between
sixteen and twenty nine it is even

43
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.370 
forty three percent. Or people say it
could be something well for

44
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.980 
long term investment. Around one out
of four respondents think that

45
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.810 
cryptocurrencies are suitable
as long term investments.

46
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.690 
And the discussion about crypto
currency is not only done by

47
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.130 
people and bitcoin user and computer
scientists which are enthusiastic

48
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.780 
about this new possibilities, but also
in the traditional financial system.

49
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.270 
They discuss how to deal
with such currencies.

50
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.980 
So there are many many projects
and intensive research,

51
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.690 
there are a lot of
investment going into

52
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.050 
such projects which use the blockchain
technology for different applications.

53
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.460 
So through numerous projects and
intensive research blockchain

54
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.570 
technology has undergone
a rapid development.

55
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.820 
Originally it was in the bitcoin system
something that work for cryptocurrency,

56
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.140 
but now it has many new applications in
the context of decentralized registers

57
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.440 
of peer-to-peer
networks to exchange value

58
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.760 
and up to programmable

59
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.150 
decentralized trust
infrastructures.

60
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.120 
So we will go into all the details
and we'll understand when we

61
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.750 
discuss the

62
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.760 
technology behind the blockchain
in our course and when we

63
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.600 
introduce the many
applications. So meanwhile

64
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.440 
the beneficiaries of blockchain is the
science of course - medical application,

65
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.020 
identity management - there are
solutions provided by blockchain,

66
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.190 
in cloud computing, cloud
storage it plays a role,

67
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.810 
the internet of things is a very
important field of application

68
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.980 
of blockchain, technology - so
finance industry, insurances, logistic,

69
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.850 
retail, energy supply - you
can look to whatever

70
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.680 
application area you like,
blockchain plays a role and

71
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.470 
the area applications can be

72
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.900 
beneficiaries of block
chain technology.

73
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.890 
So blockchain technology - there
are different use cases.

74
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:34.360 
The most widespread use case today is
taking ownership of a digital token.

75
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.730 
Currency as in case of bitcoin,
art objects, it's also

76
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.320 
increasing application
in real estate stocks.

77
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.420 
So blockchain technology
helps to be able

78
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.020 
to understand, to track, to prove
ownership of a digital token.

79
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.810 
And then automatic contracts can
be realised with block

80
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.040 
chain technology, with block
chain technology 2.0

81
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.200 
and this automated contracts
make blockchain technology

82
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.190 
into a kind of world computer. And then
identity and reputation systems

83
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
can benefit from block
chain technology.

84
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.520 
So thank you for signing up to
our openHPI course. We welcome

85
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.860 
you and we want to discuss all this
mentioned things with you in that course.

86
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.550 
So we want to introduce the
ideas, we want to have a closer

87
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.100 
look at the technology behind
the blockchain applications

88
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.680 
and to leave the hype behind
and better understanding what

89
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.870 
are the pros and what are
the cons against

90
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.210 
blockchain technology.

91
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.050 
So in the next video we start
to explore the problem -

92
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.760 
why the blockchain technology was
developed, we look for the first

93
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.620 
application the bitcoin as a
crypto currency application,

94
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.990 
which was the first cornerstone
of the blockchain technology.

95
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.150 
This is a complex thing, so we
will need almost all the week

96
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.140 
the first week of our course to go
into details and to understand

97
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.690 
the technology and then also to
understand a little bit why there

98
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:51.580 
is such an hype. Also we will also see and
discuss why many of this application

99
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.240 
need to be improved because in the
moment there are much too energy,

100
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.200 
they need too
much energy,

101
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:10.420 
for example providing the blocks in
such a chain but let's discuss this in

102
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.690 
other clips.

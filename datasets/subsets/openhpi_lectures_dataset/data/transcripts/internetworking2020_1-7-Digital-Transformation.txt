00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.008 
When we speak about the development

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.626 
of the Internet, we have to speak

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.960 
about digital transformation

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.440 
and to users.

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.710 
Let's start off with two notions

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.140 
we need to distinguish.

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
There is a notion, digitization.

8
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.809 
So is the conversion of an analog

9
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.378 
information, analog information,

10
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.829 
like a video, like music,

11
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.070 
like an image into

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.719 
digital information and digital

13
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.729 
information, which is encoded

14
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.460 
by zeros and ones.

15
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.639 
And that's digital information

16
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.070 
that can be stored

17
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.600 
by means of computers that can

18
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.020 
be processed.

19
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
And it can transmitted or

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.400 
was Internet.

21
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.310 
Did cheat Tully's Asian.

22
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.390 
Was this notion we

23
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.219 
refer to as a way

24
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.950 
in which many domains

25
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.439 
in social life, in professional

26
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.659 
life, political life, private life

27
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.630 
are restructured by usage

28
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.490 
of sea digital

29
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.550 
technologies.

30
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
So this are two

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.160 
different meanings.

32
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.349 
Gardner, for example,

33
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.490 
explains.

34
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.109 
Explain the digitalization

35
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.809 
focused on business world,

36
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.709 
as they say. Usage digitalization

37
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.790 
is a usage of digital technologies

38
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.900 
to a change business models

39
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.753 
and provide new revenue and

40
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.489 
the value of production

41
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.550 
opportunities.

42
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.390 
But a these two

43
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.700 
notions, both

44
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.130 
are closely related with

45
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.229 
digital technology and

46
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.720 
digital technologies.

47
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.440 
So to change our life.

48
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.370 
And this brings us to the notion.

49
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.500 
Digital transformation.

50
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.097 
So nowadays, digital technologies

51
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
force fundamental

52
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.479 
changes in all

53
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.620 
parts of our society, in coach

54
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.920 
or in education,

55
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.349 
in politics, in private

56
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.279 
life.

57
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.769 
And so this fundamental

58
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.579 
change.

59
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.580 
Of all this.

60
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.789 
This is cited

61
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.680 
by as a notion ditcher

62
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.770 
transformation.

63
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.280 
So digital transformation

64
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.879 
describes a proxy of digitalization,

65
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.159 
which has a major impact

66
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.715 
on everyone's private and

67
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.490 
professional life.

68
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.979 
It's the increasing use of

69
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.587 
digital information and

70
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.520 
communication technologies

71
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.189 
with its many positive

72
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.350 
aspects.

73
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.319 
But we also we need

74
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.439 
also be aware

75
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.689 
of the negative aspects.

76
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.710 
Let's have a look

77
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.569 
to such changes

78
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.949 
which are provided by

79
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.950 
digitalization.

80
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.740 
Let's start with a private life

81
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.340 
into private life.

82
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.389 
We use new forms of communication.

83
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.204 
In the early age, I've seen the net.

84
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.389 
Most people we are communicating,

85
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.349 
using forums, chat

86
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.460 
rooms, for example.

87
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.730 
I see.

88
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.360 
I see. Q M.S.

89
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.370 
and today messengers

90
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.719 
are much more popular.

91
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.177 
So people communicating

92
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.700 
with mobile and cross platforms,

93
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.410 
for example, was met up

94
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.389 
with Facebook messengers,

95
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.740 
with group chats.

96
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.160 
And there is a constant development

97
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.490 
of new.

98
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.800 
Of new messages.

99
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.229 
Social media play a

100
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.050 
big role and the revenue

101
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.360 
revolutionized the communication.

102
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.299 
Social media like Instagram,

103
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.999 
like Twitter, like Facebook.

104
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.921 
If we look to what happens in

105
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.585 
the private life, what is

106
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.209 
driven by digitalization is

107
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.660 
there are also new portlands

108
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.079 
where we get our news

109
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.779 
from.

110
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.909 
So there's a large selection

111
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.889 
of different portals which

112
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.810 
differ in terms of

113
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.819 
political directions and

114
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.210 
topicality.

115
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.869 
Music, video, fashion,

116
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.110 
cars trading and

117
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.400 
and also

118
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.680 
how we organize our private life

119
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.320 
is a influenced,

120
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.753 
very much influenced by the

121
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.930 
digitalization.

122
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.470 
So photos and

123
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.300 
data storage is done

124
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.350 
today in a complete different way

125
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.600 
than it was done when I was a child.

126
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.610 
Navigation appear.

127
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.709 
Apps Trevor apps

128
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.860 
for his umba to buy traffic

129
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900 
tickets, a daily

130
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.039 
alerts digital

131
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.319 
to do lists and shopping lists.

132
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.509 
So as a digital technology,

133
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.029 
have to restructure,

134
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.829 
reorganize our

135
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.839 
private life in many aspects.

136
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.540 
If you look at what digitalization

137
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.506 
does in private life, we also have

138
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.919 
to mention sea health

139
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.550 
area.

140
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.699 
So healthy and self

141
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.899 
determined, life said, is a change.

142
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.580 
So by which

143
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.209 
is pushed basic digitalization

144
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.729 
and the possibilities provide.

145
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.650 
So in medicine, tell a medical

146
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.600 
application what an E has

147
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.759 
apps and digital innovation

148
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.350 
in medical technologies.

149
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.779 
A say push

150
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.300 
our medical knowledge and

151
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.669 
the application and treatment

152
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.959 
in a very strong manner.

153
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.580 
How we live

154
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.470 
with respect to as

155
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.399 
a health is changing.

156
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.649 
We use assistance systems

157
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.559 
and intelligent home technologies.

158
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.160 
So this is safe mobility,

159
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.209 
a thriving assistance system.

160
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.470 
Autonomous driving,

161
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.980 
as is the area

162
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.636 
of creativity and of our

163
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.420 
hobbies, is changed by

164
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.019 
the digitalization.

165
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.139 
Those apps for creating

166
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.455 
editing, music, drawings,

167
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.850 
photos, books, games

168
00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.439 
and many other things.

169
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.709 
But digitalization is

170
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.710 
also changing how

171
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.310 
we work and how

172
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.570 
business world is organized.

173
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.739 
So the modern

174
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.870 
companies say are

175
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.610 
globally connected.

176
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.459 
So they need modern

177
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.169 
hardware and software.

178
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.509 
So they use the

179
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.599 
Internet.

180
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.389 
They use a digital technology

181
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.240 
in production in administration.

182
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.540 
So stuff need

183
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.410 
to be trained, retrained.

184
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.780 
Zosi understanding

185
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.089 
what is a knowledge in a certain

186
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.829 
profession that's needed

187
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.280 
is changing.

188
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.519 
There is.

189
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.689 
It's our faster and more

190
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.400 
stable work processes

191
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.993 
by means of sea information

192
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800 
technology.

193
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.620 
Information can be transported

194
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.490 
much faster Internet

195
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.410 
of things.

196
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.860 
Sensors can give information

197
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.710 
from different places.

198
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.550 
It can take into consideration

199
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.160 
for controlling

200
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.749 
production processes.

201
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.180 
So is the Age Ajai

202
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.860 
a organization

203
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.259 
of sea virk a process?

204
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
It's a corporation.

205
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.630 
Oh, Sparta distances

206
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.170 
and of course.

207
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.439 
Particular ends at times of

208
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.779 
Pandi, me see

209
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.690 
the importance of home office

210
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.850 
becomes visible,

211
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.279 
which is not possible

212
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.239 
with ours.

213
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.410 
Digital technologies

214
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.829 
also social life is changed

215
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.100 
by digitalization.

216
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.699 
So how we get political

217
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.470 
information, how

218
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.389 
we do elections through

219
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.149 
election and voting, for example.

220
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.190 
E voting.

221
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.329 
Voter registration, eh?

222
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.230 
And voter education.

223
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.779 
Information about see

224
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.410 
possibilities.

225
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.720 
Users can avoid this.

226
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.750 
This is all done

227
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.140 
in a ditch your way.

228
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.589 
So as a politician's public

229
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.559 
appearance are shared,

230
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.220 
evaluated and assessed

231
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.410 
anytime and anywhere.

232
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.350 
And targeted that information for

233
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.119 
water, for election

234
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.270 
indifference.

235
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.450 
And for this information, campaigns

236
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.029 
are possible thanks to data

237
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.160 
and and as as thanks to fake news.

238
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.096 
Thanks to social media, we already

239
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.839 
discussed this aspects.

240
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.639 
Send as our new form of

241
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.470 
protest in a society.

242
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.639 
Social media campaigns, a

243
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.759 
call for organizing

244
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760 
events and very

245
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.129 
ajai the

246
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.179 
very nature of

247
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.320 
doing such events.

248
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.640 
Organizing such events.

249
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.579 
Meeting for protests

250
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.049 
for information processes

251
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080 
are changed.

252
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.409 
So there are new information,

253
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.419 
new information that something

254
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.829 
happen on the other side of the

255
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.299 
world immediately.

256
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.010 
This information is with me.

257
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.139 
I can seize this information

258
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.730 
on my smartphone.

259
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.469 
So this has

260
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.139 
drastically changed to old

261
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.999 
times where it needs time

262
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.989 
to bring this information over

263
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.059 
the long distance.

264
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.850 
But with this immediately

265
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.595 
available information, everyone can

266
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:13.999 
send such information.

267
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.705 
Also, an unlimited number

268
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.499 
of untrusted information

269
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.706 
is available from all of

270
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.928 
us have heard about, say, a fake

271
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.960 
news. We already discussed.

272
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.870 
So downsides of digitalization.

273
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.673 
All this changes we have to

274
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.039 
learn to deal with is

275
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.509 
that there is a change.

276
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.929 
What concerning privacy

277
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.534 
with this new technology is there is

278
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.110 
a loss of privacy

279
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.140 
we cannot use as smartphone

280
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.170 
apps.

281
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.840 
Many of the smartphone apps

282
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.119 
without sets, smartphone

283
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.009 
knows and with a smartphone

284
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.690 
or a smartphone provider knows

285
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.879 
exactly in which place we

286
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.230 
are in this moment.

287
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.419 
So society

288
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.201 
and all parts of society, all

289
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.169 
actors in society, becomes

290
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.879 
much more transparent

291
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.000 
and more personal information are

292
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.070 
available into social media.

293
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.629 
Some people tell all cell

294
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.050 
assaults and all they are Immunex

295
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.863 
to the social media without

296
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.850 
thinking. That's very difficult,

297
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.769 
almost impossible to

298
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.770 
take it away.

299
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.919 
Tracking and tracing

300
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.200 
of user activities

301
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.679 
is easy in the Internet.

302
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.830 
It's also sometimes necessary to

303
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.570 
to provide services

304
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.049 
with a smartphone and

305
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.179 
with the PRIO

306
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.549 
device, say is a permanent

307
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.610 
accessibility

308
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.800 
of appeals, says Haidian

309
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.669 
Nanex, an Internet portals

310
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.499 
and social media that

311
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.590 
generates a need for

312
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.260 
looking for something new.

313
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.980 
So sometimes you can observe

314
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.904 
young people which every time, every

315
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.360 
minute looking to their smartphone.

316
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.969 
Not to miss some of

317
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.229 
this new information.

318
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.190 
So the fear of

319
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.730 
missing out is

320
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.129 
some some things that

321
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.710 
leads people to permanently

322
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.899 
use their smartphone for

323
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.820 
checking apps

324
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880 
and information,

325
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.840 
says a rapid pace of development

326
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.820 
that creates a feeling of

327
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.030 
dependance.

328
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.900 
So one needs to be a

329
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.110 
part of this changes.

330
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.369 
One needs to be every time

331
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.079 
online.

332
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.999 
Not only in the sense of

333
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.830 
being connected to the Internet, but

334
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.190 
looking what's going on.

335
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.185 
So is the sheer volume of

336
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.409 
information that's available.

337
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.039 
If we want to buy something everyone

338
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.471 
to make a decision about holy

339
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.259 
day, if we

340
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.980 
need to make a

341
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.240 
decision in our work,

342
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.449 
then the decision making

343
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.580 
becomes much more difficult

344
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.249 
because it needs to

345
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.080 
be much more information

346
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.989 
to analyze and

347
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.059 
to put into

348
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.390 
context.

349
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.929 
There are more downsides of Stich

350
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:12.930 
stylization.

351
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.429 
So blurred boundaries between

352
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.119 
leisure and work.

353
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.179 
So the usage of the private

354
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.989 
device for professional work.

355
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.219 
So it makes many things very easy,

356
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.958 
but it brings you also

357
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.779 
into position in your

358
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.700 
leisure time. You can look

359
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.969 
and some people expected

360
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.450 
that you have to look

361
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.360 
on your business information.

362
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.909 
So as a mobile, technologies enabled

363
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.559 
permanent availability.

364
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.710 
And so for many people,

365
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.059 
it creates a feeling

366
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.879 
that you must be reachable

367
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.100 
because you can

368
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.460 
say are even more

369
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.379 
downsides of the digitalization.

370
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.049 
So it's a problem caused by

371
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.639 
unverified information

372
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.309 
about hate speech, about

373
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.049 
fake news. We already discussed.

374
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.870 
So hate speech is a very

375
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.450 
big problem that people

376
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.250 
tell wrong things about other

377
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.529 
people's inhuman

378
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.149 
statements against individuals

379
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.519 
or against groups that

380
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.100 
may contain incitement,

381
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.349 
hatred, discrimination and others.

382
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.169 
So often it is targeted against

383
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.940 
people of a certain

384
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.060 
group.

385
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.289 
So since.

386
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.079 
So it's this way.

387
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.619 
It's different to

388
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.579 
what's cyber bullying

389
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.889 
as it could to target everyone.

390
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.200 
So if we see

391
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.149 
around one percent

392
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.780 
of the users.

393
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.299 
Right. Hate comments

394
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.810 
with the number of

395
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.830 
hate comments is increasing.

396
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.320 
So here is an observation,

397
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.589 
a survey that shows

398
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.570 
that there are more

399
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.040 
and more hate speakers

400
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.630 
in the Internet.

401
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.340 
So in Germany, there is a rule

402
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.490 
is a net stagy.

403
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.360 
It does come into place in 2018,

404
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.269 
and it's a law to improve

405
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.771 
the law enforcement in social

406
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.110 
networks that

407
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.279 
say do something again.

408
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.470 
Such hate speech.

409
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.550 
Fake news either actually affects

410
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.529 
your nose, is up to

411
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.777 
politicians, is hard to work with

412
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:29.949 
us.

413
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.130 
It's very bad development.

414
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.289 
So if we look for the first lessons

415
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.570 
we have learned, it's a very new

416
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.148 
development in the next 50 years

417
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.019 
old.

418
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.294 
World Wide Web is about 30

419
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.066 
years old. All these new

420
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.330 
developments are in

421
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.580 
the last few

422
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.570 
in the last few decades.

423
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.419 
So a claim

424
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.904 
we are not even completely

425
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.289 
understanding this new world.

426
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.539 
So we have permanently

427
00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840 
to learn lessons.

428
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.349 
So first lesson is people have

429
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.029 
to learn how to deal

430
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.179 
with this new farce in expectancy.

431
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.700 
Did your World Wednesday

432
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.820 
day to reject?

433
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.570 
How is a deal with this?

434
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.149 
When the stress and have a

435
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.970 
negative impact on the pills in

436
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.068 
life, how to deal with

437
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.840 
this effect?

438
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.609 
To take care about physical and

439
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.809 
mental health, which

440
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.349 
can be affected by this

441
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.749 
fast going new digital

442
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.800 
world.

443
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.490 
Exhaustion, energy and depletion.

444
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440 
Burn out.

445
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.804 
Such are scenes that often

446
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.779 
are driven by digital

447
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.580 
technologies.

448
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.379 
So what everyone has

449
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.330 
to define for its life.

450
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.269 
It's the question when

451
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.669 
and for whom I am

452
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000 
available.

453
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.570 
Should I be available after hours?

454
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.549 
Should I be reachable during

455
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.539 
vacation?

456
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.110 
Do I have to be available

457
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.169 
any time for as a person?

458
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.659 
This is personal decisions.

459
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.719 
One has to observe himself

460
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.970 
when have to see what are

461
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.029 
says. A new visual

462
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.430 
developments. How is a

463
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040 
influenza.

464
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.089 
A life.

465
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.559 
And then one have to draw

466
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800 
conclusion.

467
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.609 
So define rules

468
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.830 
for access to private

469
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.149 
and professional life.

470
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.519 
Should employees be

471
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.000 
have access to their work accounts

472
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040 
in their free time?

473
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.159 
How much time do I spend into

474
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.190 
digital media?

475
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.882 
How can I regulate this time

476
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.169 
more? All this question

477
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.749 
need answers and a

478
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.329 
no general answers are in place.

479
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.899 
They need to be answered personally.

480
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.129 
So our social challenges

481
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.129 
with this digital transformation,

482
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.519 
dealing with digital,

483
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.479 
bold political decisions

484
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.579 
are needed, decision making

485
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.470 
process often took too long.

486
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.960 
In our old tradition, in our world,

487
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560 
and thus standing in

488
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.559 
the way of innovation,

489
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.049 
so many new things that are possible

490
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.422 
with digital technologies do

491
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.130 
not come into place because

492
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.280 
regulations and to

493
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.209 
define regulations is

494
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.579 
too slow.

495
00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.889 
Process to what extend

496
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.519 
should and can set policy

497
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.429 
policymakers regulate the

498
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.358 
Internet.

499
00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.309 
It's a big question is the moment

500
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.529 
we see the discussion needs

501
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.799 
to be as deetz internet

502
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.400 
to be nationalized

503
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.950 
need to be defined.

504
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.960 
Bordeaux's in the Internet.

505
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.079 
China has already answered this

506
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.099 
question by having this great

507
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.629 
Chinese. It's this great Chinese

508
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.630 
firewall.

509
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.830 
But we in

510
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.339 
our societies and our Western

511
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.470 
societies, we have to sing

512
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.889 
and to discuss about this

513
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.209 
question. What about with the data?

514
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.579 
With the data protection?

515
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.229 
Who is what is

516
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.900 
about content censorship?

517
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.106 
How to deal with copyright in this

518
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.400 
new world says all

519
00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.080 
questions need answers because

520
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.829 
new technology and digital

521
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.390 
transformation has changed

522
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.750 
the world.

523
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.559 
So to give an example to Germany

524
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.960 
is pretty far behind

525
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.930 
as behind

526
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.799 
in the field of digitalization.

527
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.110 
So especially in the fields of

528
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.390 
e-government, it's this fields of

529
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.609 
school education and healthcare.

530
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.420 
And one reason is we

531
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.470 
have a very regulated

532
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.239 
situation here in Germany.

533
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.700 
And there's new digital

534
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.039 
possibilities as new digital

535
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.349 
challenges say are

536
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.480 
not considered in this regulation.

537
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.373 
So many regulations need to

538
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.099 
be changed when such

539
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160 
a digital technology

540
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.729 
is digital application, digital

541
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.829 
procedures unused.

542
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.218 
And of course, there is a lot of

543
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.829 
research work to be done.

544
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.840 
How can a good corporation and

545
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.849 
private professional social life

546
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.189 
into the digital world look

547
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.149 
like?

548
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.509 
How can it promote it?

549
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.079 
Or another question, how do I

550
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.000 
and my family use

551
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.499 
CNN and saving lives?

552
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.239 
I was a big complex of

553
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360 
cybersecurity.

554
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.869 
There are many, many open questions.

555
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.709 
Answers.

556
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.450 
Digital transformation is in place.

557
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.940 
We have to do

558
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.619 
and we have to learn

559
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.049 
to live in this new world.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.070 
Welcome, Dr. Heimgärtner.....
Thank you very much

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.010 
for the introduction.
Welcome to the

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.950 
intercultural competence
for virtual team videos.

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.170 
There are three videos and this is
the first one, I will talk about

12
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.430 
the motivation, different
cultures, misunderstandings.

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.410 
Ensuring successful communication,
problem-solving, personal

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.580 
traits and intercultural
development inventory.

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.290 
The most important aspect in
intercultural virtual teams is

16
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.600 
culture, if the members are
from the same culture

17
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.960 
there is the same
language and there is

18
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.000 
the same communication patterns,
therefore, the understanding

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.230 
is a very easy normal
case. Furthermore, the

20
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.960 
facts about the world you have
in your mind, also called

21
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.460 
belief, desires and
decisions are similar, so

22
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.840 
there is no problem to
communicate with each other.

23
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.440 
Furthermore and finally, also the
empathy, it is possible very

24
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.070 
easily because you are
thinking in the same

25
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.560 
manner and you can easily
take yourself in the

26
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.610 
place of others.

27
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.830 
However, if the difference, if
there are different cultures

28
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.350 
and there are members from different
cultures, all the suspects

29
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.910 
I mentioned before are different
and you have to take them into

30
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.860 
account, if you like to have
successful communication.

31
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.720 
The objective is,
therefore, two equal this

32
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.260 
aspects I mentioned and to enhance,
and to ensure successful

33
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.390 
communication by same
or similar thinking.

34
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.470 
One of the most famous
models is from Lewis,

35
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it is a model of cross-cultural
communication.

36
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.840 
differentiating between three
types of cultures; multi active,

37
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.620 
linear active, and reactive
cultures. The people in the

38
00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.270 
multi active cultures already
relationship oriented and emotionally,

39
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.110 
and also having dynamic
schedules for example,

40
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.150 
in contrast to people
from linear active

41
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.400 
cultures, that have task
orientation and therefore,

42
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.970 
very precise and
linear planning.

43
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.930 
The third cultural type of this
model are re-active cultures,

44
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.700 
they focus on respect,
on face-saving

45
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.200 
and striving to harmony.
These different

46
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.440 
cultural types have therefore
different cultural communication

47
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.150 
patterns and
methodology

48
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.690 
to use in intercultural
communication.

49
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.090 
An example is problem-solving
behavior, for example in India

50
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.760 
and in Germany, there
is a difference here.

51
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.930 
Also, in the copying strategy and
in the tactics and decision

52
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.960 
making, caused by the different
communication patterns.

53
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.100 
You have for example, a
direct speech in Germany,

54
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.990 
where you say what you mean
or you mean what you

55
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.220 
say. In contrast to
Indian people,

56
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.960 
whom indirectly
use the language

57
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.290 
in order not to hurt
any other, save face

58
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.690 
and stick for example to the
restraint strategy, once selected.

59
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.980 
In contrast, the German people
who are task oriented,

60
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.860 
have no problems with
making decisions for

61
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.450 
example and are more flexible
in a study check thinking.

62
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.440 
Another example is a
low and high context

63
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.830 
culture, the high context
cultures like India, china

64
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.200 
saudi arabia and italy, are
more relationship oriented,

65
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.650 
and exhibiting high
context. Meaning that,

66
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.270 
the speech is using or

67
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:39.020 
the people uses a
very elaborated

68
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.050 
and not hurting

69
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.660 
speech in order to
save their face.

70
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.660 
In contrast low context
cultures like USA,

71
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.160 
UK, Germany or Sweden
aer task-oriented

72
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.300 
and focus on more tasks
than on relationships.

73
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.050 
Therefore, they are also a stick
to accurate agendas for example,

74
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.790 
punctuality and probably also
somewhat aggressive if

75
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.290 
they will not get
their opinion.

76
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.710 
This is the most important
differences here

77
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.580 
and there are also many more
aspects, that have to be

78
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.690 
taking into account in
intercultural virtual teams.

79
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.120 
For example, the character
or personal treat

80
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.400 
of a person he is very important
for intercultural virtual teams.

81
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.110 
Such traits are for
example coping with

82
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.420 
ambiguity or frustration
or with conflicts,

83
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.760 
furthermore, such people
have to be unbiased

84
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.990 
and intercultural
willingness to learn.

85
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.840 
Another very important aspect,
is that the motivation

86
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.380 
for intercultural
cooperation is high,

87
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.830 
in order to integrate into
foreign environments.

88
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.530 
And this stability of
existing relationship,

89
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.030 
fully physical and
physiological resilience,

90
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.710 
stress resistance and emotional
stability is important

91
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.430 
to have a successful
intercultural virtual teams.

92
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.290 
There is a method or
possibility to determine

93
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.840 
these skills you have to have if
you work in intercultural virtual

94
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:59.740 
teams. This method is called
interculturale development

95
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.480 
inventory and with this
inventory you can

96
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.940 
determine, your
intercultural sensitivity

97
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.300 
the degree of intercultural
sensitivity.

98
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.700 
Summarizing the aspects
I mentioned before,

99
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.940 
this model and this inventory is
based on the model from Bennett:

100
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.770 
It is a development model of
intercultural sensitivity

101
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:35.080 
and this model represents
the state between being

102
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.980 
ethnocentric and
ethno-relativistic.

103
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:50.960 
The aim is to come from ethnocentric
status to the ethno-relativistic

104
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.230 
status, this means that
you accept and integrate

105
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.780 
finally into
another culture.

106
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:07.250 
There are six steps which you can
have or which you can evaluate

107
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:14.740 
from this model and this is done
with a fifty item questionnaire,

108
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.490 
you have to answer and
if it is evaluated,

109
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.110 
you get a result of the
degree between one

110
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.800 
and six according to the
stages of this model.

111
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.220 
If you do not have the highest
level the ethno-relativistic

112
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.650 
level, it indicates that you have
to do also an intercultural

113
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.770 
training being abroad
or gathering

114
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.360 
more experience in the
intercultural context before

115
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.260 
being successful in
such intercultural

116
00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:00.600 
teams. If you have more
detailed questions about the

117
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:06.250 
topics I presented so far. Please,
have a look at the references

118
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.110 
especially, here you
can see in the list

119
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.900 
Thank you very much for
listening to this

120
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.200 
video and I welcome you
for the next one.

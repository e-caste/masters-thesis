00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.920 
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to
welcome you to our new online course

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.650 
"Step-by-step Introduction
to Process Mining."

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.050 
My name is Mathias Weske and I
am the chair of the Business

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.560 
Process Technology research group, Hasso
Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.790 
in this video clip, I would like
to give you an overview of

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.810 
the video clips that we
have for you in week one.

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.180 
Week one starts with an introduction
to business processes - process mining

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.160 
is a part of business process
management, so we discuss a few

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.610 
important aspects of
business processes.

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.790 
In the second video clip, we
provide you an overview of the

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.630 
artefacts and also the topics
that we have in process mining.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.320 
Process mining is heavily based
on data, so in the third video

13
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.120 
clip we look at data in
business process executions.

14
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.930 
Process mining algorithms are
not directly based on data, but

15
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.190 
they work on events. So, we need to
transform the data that we find

16
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.610 
to events. In particular, we transform
events or we organize events to event

17
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
logs and we use instance correlation to
define traces and also trace variants.

18
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.700 
And we do this in video
clips four, five and six.

19
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.310 
In video clip seven, we look at
process discovery. So we do not

20
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.370 
investigate process
discovery algorithms,

21
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.360 
but we do process discovery
by hand, if you want, to

22
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.860 
let you know what is the main
idea behind process discovery

23
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.830 
and how can we really discover
a process based on a number

24
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.050 
of traces and
trace variants.

25
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.870 
Process enhancement is in center of video
clip eight. So in process enhancement,

26
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
we use information that
we have discovered

27
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.820 
to improve the process, so that we can get
rid of certain problems that we have

28
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.700 
found in earlier iterations
of the BPM life cycle.

29
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.420 
In video clip nine and ten, we
turn to practical aspects.

30
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.360 
In video clip number nine, we look
at event logs, we are introducing

31
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.000 
an event log format

32
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.700 
and in video clip ten, we look at process
discovery and enhancement, where we

33
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.890 
use two tools - one will be the inductive
miner that we use, and the other

34
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.410 
is a commercial tool called disco
and we explain how

35
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.010 
we can do process discovery and
enhancement using these tools.

36
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.200 
And a brief summary completes
the video clips in week one.

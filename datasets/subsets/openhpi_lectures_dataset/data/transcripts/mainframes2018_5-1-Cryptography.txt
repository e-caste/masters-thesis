00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.279 
Hello, it's me again.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.739 
Wolfram Greis from the European Maintenance Academy and in the next

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.719 
videoclip, I want to talk about one part of mainframe security, cryptography

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.960 
and how it's supported by the hardware.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.459 
Data are the most important assets,

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.329 
I think you agree to that statement, though.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.329 
Data and programs must be protected.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.999 
And this is true protection from external people,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.299 
customers, partners, hackers, of course, as well

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.379 
our internal workforce. And for the rules,

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.129 
we have the global data protection rules.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.739 
We have Sarbanes-Oxley.

13
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.629 
We have a payment card industry data security standard

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.179 
with 12 requirements.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.189 
And two of these requirements are to protect stored

16
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.989 
data means data at rest in the mainframe

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.089 
environment. And another requirement is

18
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.949 
protect data set is on the fly means transmission

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810 
of cardholder data across open public networks.

20
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.619 
And we have HIPAA.

21
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.179 
This is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

22
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.040 
And you have to be compliant with all these regulations and rules

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.699 
when we think about the evolution of security in the meantime, environment

24
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.169 
in the past, there are only a handful highly skilled experts that had access

25
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.669 
to a mainframe. And if you want to steal some data, you have to

26
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.949 
get into this closed shop.

27
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.169 
It is normally what's normally impossible and you had to steal

28
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.539 
the punch card takes not that easy

29
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.729 
during time. It has become much easier to create and accessed data on mainframes.

30
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.258 
Today, the mainframes are connected via DCP to the

31
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.939 
Internet. So security, of course, in this case is really

32
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.769 
an issue. And protection of data, I think you agree,

33
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.180 
is very important today.

34
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.509 
Logical access control is integrated into us.

35
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.299 
I come to that in the next video clip.

36
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.789 
And in this video clip, I want to talk about the encryption

37
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.649 
and especially with C14, the most current machine

38
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.179 
at these times, pervasive encryption with IBM, CE was

39
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.119 
introduced. It means that the

40
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.899 
cryptography technologies are integrated into the hardware.

41
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.049 
This is only partly new.

42
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.759 
So Sipek F is available for a long time.

43
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.589 
It means z/OS CPU, a system of cryptographic functions.

44
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.999 
We have the next generation of the group to express cards.

45
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.900 
This is an optional card for additional

46
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.229 
and get better performance for

47
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.459 
cryptographic functions.

48
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.789 
We have the possibility to secure not only

49
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.339 
data in flight.

50
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.929 
In flight means when we transmit data via networks, we also

51
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.479 
can very easily now with very encryption, very easily

52
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.709 
protect data at rest means the data set are within the mainframe.

53
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.159 
Environment means data in Linux filesystems or data in

54
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
z/OS datasets.

55
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.229 
Also, protection of data in the clustering environment is

56
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.039 
supported. It means the protection of data in the coupling facilities,

57
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.809 
coupling facilities, the memory that is shared

58
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.879 
between different operating systems in a cluster environment,

59
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.860 
in a suplex parlor's inflects GDP environment on mainframes.

60
00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.039 
Although of course network attack protection

61
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.749 
is assured, we have the possibility to implement secure service

62
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.759 
containers. Also a very important new possibility to

63
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.329 
get an even higher security as before.

64
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.989 
OK, here we see the hardware that implements

65
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.799 
the cryptographic environment on our IBM mainframes.

66
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.729 
We have the physical machine on the left side here and within this physically machines,

67
00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.649 
we have the dos and on these walls we have the processing

68
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.899 
units. Processing units can be characterized in different types.

69
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.429 
And these processing units are on the

70
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.879 
single chip modules and on each of these

71
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.589 
processing units, each of these processors has a cryptographic, uh,

72
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.939 
extension. It's a central processing assist, cryptographic function.

73
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.559 
It's a complex process. So each and every CPU

74
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.479 
already installed to assist cryptographic

75
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.219 
functions and additional and as an option,

76
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.199 
we can have crypto express cards in the PCI

77
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.709 
e environment in the slots here.

78
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.149 
And these express cards also bring a

79
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.879 
much higher performance on cryptographic functions and processing

80
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.639 
and additional also as an option.

81
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.589 
We have that as the key entry.

82
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.779 
It's an environment where we can get keys into

83
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.879 
our mainframe environment.

84
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.549 
The CPAC straw cryptographic functions again here you see the single module,

85
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.989 
these are, as I already said, available on each

86
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.229 
and every processor already installed.

87
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.699 
The Pusa processing unit can be defined as the central

88
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.379 
processor, as an integrated facility for Linux,

89
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.669 
Linux as a cap.

90
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.979 
S.O.P are no longer available.

91
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.509 
But important today are the CPC information

92
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.399 
integration processes and z/OS

93
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.989 
CPF functionality is supported by nearly all

94
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.439 
operating systems running on mainframe.

95
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.119 
It means on z/OS, on KVM,

96
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.039 
on C, v, e, on setpiece and on Linux.

97
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.240 
On C systems.

98
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.889 
The cryptographic functions that are supposed to be hashing functions, you see

99
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.419 
all the standards that are implemented and supported and also

100
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.489 
important is a random number generation possibility for

101
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.409 
generating random numbers and message authentication.

102
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.999 
And the core processor, the spaces for cryptographic

103
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.399 
functions, supports encryption, decryption

104
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.139 
of clear and protected key operations for each

105
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.269 
and all cryptographic functions,

106
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.859 
secure socket transport, layer security, virtual private networks, APIs and so

107
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.019 
on. You see, each and every possibilities are available

108
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.849 
and each and every standards are

109
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:08.850 
supported.

110
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.789 
This was the first part concerning the

111
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.889 
more detailed information about security and in the next part, I talk about

112
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.189 
the security within the operating system

113
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.549 
for questions and remarks.

114
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.439 
Police use, as always, our discussion forum on the

115
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.079 
openHPI platform.

116
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.970 
Thank you very much for attending and hope to see you in the next videoclip.

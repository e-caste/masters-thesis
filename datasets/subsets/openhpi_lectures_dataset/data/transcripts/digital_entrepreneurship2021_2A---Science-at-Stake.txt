1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.940 
What is evidence-based entrepreneurship and why is it important

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.159 
and why should you care about scientific principles and entrepreneurship

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.869 
instead of going right into action, pursuing your entrepreneurial idea.

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.668 
In this session on the Scientific Principles in Entrepreneurship, we want to speak

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.859 
about why it is important to conduct research on such a practical topic,

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.019 
what disciplines are included, how entrepreneurship researchers ensure

7
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.695 
the rigour and relevance of their work, and how typical research designs in

8
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.488 
this field look like. Welcome, my name is Prof. Dr Katharina HÃ¶lze

9
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.979 
and my name is Nina Bachmann, we are entrepreneurship researchers and therefore

10
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.749 
obviously excited about the scientific principles in entrepreneurship.

11
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.729 
In today's session, we want to share some of this excitement with

12
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.560 
you, explain to you why this is important and of course,

13
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.310 
we want to give you insights into entrepreneurship research.

14
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.469 
In this first video, we will focus on the importance of conducting science

15
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.980 
in the entrepreneurship domain.

16
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.040 
The second video will help you to read and understand entrepreneurship research

17
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.919 
as a multidisciplinary field.

18
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.030 
Finally, in the third video, you will learn about common research processes

19
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.109 
and designs in the entrepreneurship field.

20
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.529 
So, let's jump into the first topic, the importance

21
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.830 
of conducting science in the entrepreneurship domain.

22
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.991 
Let me first introduce you to what is generally called the scientific

23
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.930 
approach. What makes it different from a non-scientific approach?

24
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.222 
And maybe most interestingly, what are the characteristics

25
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.482 
of the scientific approach that make it a useful tool so that people

26
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.863 
want to use it to find answers to important questions.

27
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.119 
In their book on research designs, Mitchell and Jolley answer

28
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.919 
this question by naming eight characteristics of a scientific

29
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.818 
approach. These are that Science 1.

30
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.674 
Finds general rules, 2.

31
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.376 
Collects objective evidence, 3.

32
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.472 
Makes testable statements, 4.

33
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.529 
Adopts a sceptical questioning attitude about all claims,

34
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.726 
5. Remains open minded about new claims, 6.

35
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.054 
Is creative, 7. Is public, and 8.

36
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.879 
Is productive. So let's take a look at what is underlying

37
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.969 
to these characteristics of the scientific approach.

38
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.619 
First, scientists assume that events happen for

39
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.780 
a reason, they are seeking rules, patterns or laws,

40
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.089 
thereby they hope that they will find order in a seemingly random

41
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.932 
universe and find explanations for, for example, behavior,

42
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.669 
successes or failures and may even predict events.

43
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.089 
In short, scientists want to make the world more understandable.

44
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.810 
Second, however, when pursuing the goal of making the world easier,

45
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.659 
scientists need to make sure that they do not make it too simple.

46
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.610 
What does that mean? Generally, people tend to see rules and patterns

47
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.879 
that actually reflect their biases instead of facts.

48
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.719 
So, it is essential in a scientific approach that you test your beliefs

49
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.473 
against observable objective evidence rather than against

50
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.130 
your subjective impressions.

51
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.580 
Well, what does objective evidence mean?

52
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.679 
In simple words? Objective evidence looks the same to any observer,

53
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.050 
no matter the observer's personal beliefs.

54
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.167 
If you wonder what all of this has to do with entrepreneurship, make sure

55
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.560 
to stick until the end of the video, because we will come back to that.

56
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.799 
Before let us make a third point about the scientific

57
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.740 
approach because scientists somehow have this in common with

58
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.819 
entrepreneurs. We as scientists are encouraged to take risks, most

59
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.209 
specifically, the research of scientists that only prove the obvious is

60
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.839 
usually quite boring, both to conduct this research and to read

61
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.330 
this research. No one wants to do that.

62
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.389 
Thus to conduct interesting research, scientists need to speculate about

63
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.300 
possible causalities and predictions.

64
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.196 
But they also need to be willing to put their speculations to the test and

65
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.569 
admit errors. This is an essential aspect of the scientific approach

66
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.869 
and leads us to a major strength of scientific thinking.

67
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.819 
Scientific methods allow the scientists to learn from their mistakes

68
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.100 
and to learn from a mistake, you first need to know that you made a mistake.

69
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.820 
And this is the reason why a scientific approach requires making testable

70
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.970 
and correctable statements.

71
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.110 
I think you already see the parallel to entrepreneurs.

72
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.818 
Just like scientists, entrepreneurs are encouraged to take risks instead

73
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.910 
of pursuing what has already been done, especially when they

74
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.899 
aim to become the founders of a radical or a disruptive innovation.

75
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.352 
And just like scientists, entrepreneurs need to be willing

76
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.569 
to try and then to admit when they are wrong and then try

77
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.680 
again and again with another testable statements to sum up

78
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.360 
whether you are entrepreneur or you plan to be open or not at all.

79
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.069 
A scientific approach that adopts a sceptical acritical attitude

80
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.949 
may help you to make better decisions.

81
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.775 
If you are interested in a deeper understanding of the scientific approach, feel free

82
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.753 
to take a look at the book - "Research designs explained" published

83
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.827 
by Mark Mitchell and Janina Jolley.

84
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.359 
You will find a reference to the book in a supporting material.

85
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.069 
So great! Now, we know that it is useful for entrepreneurs

86
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.961 
to use scientific thinking and that, in fact, entrepreneurs

87
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.369 
are very similar to scientists.

88
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.449 
How else can entrepreneurs benefit from science?

89
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.011 
One of the key points of science is evidence that means the

90
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
proof of the hypothesis.

91
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.819 
Every research starts with a research question that leads to hypotheses

92
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.350 
and doing your research, you want to collect evidence to either approve

93
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.168 
or reject your hypothesis, ultimately answering your

94
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.180 
research question.

95
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.569 
Why is this important?

96
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.089 
The answer is scientific evidence can effectively support everyday

97
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.439 
judgments and decisions, especially in entrepreneurial practice.

98
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.569 
Let's have a look at two critical aspects that distinguish entrepreneurship

99
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.119 
from other evidence-based fields such as medicine or management

100
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.529 
and what we can learn from those for evidence-based entrepreneurship.

101
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.273 
First, entrepreneurship deals with generating novelty and

102
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.429 
being different from other participants in the industry.

103
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.350 
Therefore, when entrepreneurs deviate from what is typically thought to be

104
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.030 
good practice, this may be for very good reasons.

105
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.919 
However, most entrepreneurs act opportunistically, base their

106
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.180 
decisions on heuristics and rely on improvisation and intuition.

107
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.209 
This often leads to doing the same mistakes again or not

108
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.120 
collecting enough proof to stop the chosen path and choose another one.

109
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.020 
The founder of the Lean Startup approach, Steve Blank, says

110
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.009 
"a hypothesis means we have an educated guess that requires

111
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.826 
experimentation and data to validate or invalidate",

112
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.059 
thus, if entrepreneurs collect data that is evidence, they

113
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.440 
have a much better base for their decisions.

114
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.209 
Second, entrepreneurs are not a uniform group

115
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.689 
of people that could easily be defined and then undergo, for example, a

116
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.709 
professional education such as medical doctors.

117
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.949 
Consequently, we need to teach entrepreneurship evidence to current and

118
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.509 
future entrepreneurs, but not only to them, but also

119
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.842 
to other stakeholders in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, be it public

120
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.204 
policy, investors, established companies, they

121
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:48.100 
all can learn and benefit from evidence-based entrepreneurship

122
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.900 
as it provides a solid framework to build their decisions on.

123
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.235 
So, so much for the first video in today's session on scientific principles

124
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:04.250 
and entrepreneurship. We hope that you take something away from your

125
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.339 
everyday life and your decisions.

126
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.350 
And we see you in the next one, where we will pick up from here and discuss

127
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.909 
where you can actually find entrepreneurship evidence.

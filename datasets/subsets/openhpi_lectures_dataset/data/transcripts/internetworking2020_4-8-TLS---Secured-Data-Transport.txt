00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.800 
In our OpenHPI course a half century

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.480 
of Internet,
we have also to discuss about security

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.000 
in the Internet,
and this is a good time to do this

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.880 
when we speak about the protocols

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.480 
and the transport layer,
because they are very efficient

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.480 
protection measures, on top of that layer
is the TLS  secured data.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.080 
transport.

8
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.000 
Security has many different aspects.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.280 
When we speak about security

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.560 
of the Internet, we have to differentiate
between these different security aspects

11
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.600 
to be able to select
the right protection methods.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.920 
So when we speak about the different

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.480 
security aspects,
we speak about security codes

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.400 
and before one is able to find and define

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
the right protective measures
for securing of communication

16
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.480 
in the Internet, one has to exactly
define the security codes.

17
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
Here are some basic security codes.

18
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.040 
First, is availability, often it is not
counted as being a security aspect.

19
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.840 
But if you trust that there is

20
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.480 
an in a hospital and emergency service
over the Internet provided

21
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.080 
and this service did not work after five
o'clock, it is not available, that's that.

22
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.200 
Another security goal is data integrity.

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.520 
Data integrity is an important
topic for Internet communication.

24
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.400 
Internet is an open system.

25
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.000 
Everyone who has access to the Internet is
in principle able to manipulate the data

26
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.000 
packages that are transported
through the Internet.

27
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.040 
The receiver,

28
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.400 
he or she cannot distinguish whether
the data are sent from the original sender,

29
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.320 
or whether they received the manipulated
data by a cyber criminal.

30
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.760 
So additional measures need to be taken

31
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.600 
to help the receiver to realize
whether the data came in the original form.

32
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.560 
Whether they are in taker or not,
same is with the sender address.

33
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.360 
Then we have the security goal:
the confidentiality.

34
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.520 
So this is clear.

35
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.320 
Everyone understands when he or she
is speaking about security, that

36
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.000 
confidential communication is

37
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.320 
of course a basic security code
and that's our basic security goal,

38
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.640 
i.e authentication to identify
in person that is moving through

39
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.760 
the Internet.
That a person that wants to access

40
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.200 
an Internet service
to find out the identity of that person.

41
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.440 
You know, passwords are
in many cases used for that.

42
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.600 
Other methods are available
and closely connected

43
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.560 
to the authentication
is another basic security goal:

44
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.120 
The authorization.
After a person is identified by your

45
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.600 
service, then the service
needs to check if

46
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.560 
this person is authorized to use this resource, whether he has, for example,

47
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.040 
paid for it or whether it's not allowed
to get access to these resources.

48
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.600 
For all the protection measures to reach

49
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.920 
the security goals, an appropriate
security architecture is required.

50
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.760 
An architecture that provides
possibilities to ensure the security goals

51
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.960 
and the requirements for the different
Internet applications.

52
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.680 
And this securing of the protocols of all

53
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.720 
the protocols in TCP/IP stack,
is possible on the transport layer.

54
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.560 
So the provision of security
mechanisms to ensure security guards

55
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.640 
can take place at different layers.

56
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.680 
But the transport layer is best suited.

57
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.400 
We could place this

58
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.320 
security mechanisms,

59
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.560 
for example,
on the application layer.

60
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.640 
Then for each application

61
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.240 
World Wide Web, email,
and the hundreds of other services,

62
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.720 
we need to develop new security
mechanisms around this application.

63
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.920 
We could in very detailed specify what needs

64
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.560 
to be secured and what not,
but it's very, very costly.

65
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.080 
And on the other side, if we

66
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.120 
place our protection measures on the
Internet layer, it is very complex.

67
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.600 
Each data package is,
for example, encrypted,

68
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.560 
even simple technical messages
which do not need to be encrypted.

69
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.760 
So it's very complex.

70
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.280 
And this is done, for example,
for virtual private networks,

71
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.760 
but for the general and efficient
mechanisms for securing the protocols

72
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.600 
of the TCP/IP protocol stack is the
transport layer and all the TLS protocols.

73
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.280 
And you see it is a new layer in between

74
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.080 
the TCP, the transport layer,
and the application layer.

75
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.320 
So the TLS protocol or protocols are

76
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.520 
placed here and are very efficient for use
in securing the Internet protocols.

77
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.280 
Let's look to the history of that.

78
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.080 
History is SSL.
.

79
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.000 
The Secure Socket Layer the older among us.

80
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.040 
Remember this, this was in ninety four.

81
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.280 
I

82
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.880 
mean that was developed by Netscape
and because in that time

83
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.120 
Internet was used more and more open
for business activity,

84
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.360 
then the need for securing the Internet
protocols and securing the transport

85
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.360 
of data through the internet
became more and more important.

86
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.360 
So Netscape, as the one who

87
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.480 
had developed a famous browser,
they developed their own

88
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.440 
secure transport infrastructure
for confidential data

89
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.800 
in connection with their businesses and
for usage in the World Wide Web.

90
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.840 
So what they did, they developed
SSL and then HGP protocol.

91
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:14.000 
The protocol of a World Wide Web
application over SSL was called HTTPS.

92
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.480 
We will go in more details

93
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.600 
in the last week of our
OpenHPI course because it's very interesting.

94
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.120 
And if you consider, for example,

95
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.880 
in your online banking
communication or within the online

96
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:35.720 
banks, you can observe
that all this communication is done via

97
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.800 
HTTPS, and if not this would be terrible.

98
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.760 
You should immediately stop
such kind of communication.

99
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.240 
So the idea of SSL, of the secure socket

100
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.080 
layer was to provide an additional
protocol layer in between the

101
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.400 
transport layer and the application layer.
On the application layer

102
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.400 
there is this HTTP

103
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:06.560 
protocol and on the transport layer,
there is the TCP protocol that is used by HTTP.

104
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:14.480 
The idea and the motivation for SSL
was to ensure confidential transport.

105
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.760 
So it provide encryption mechanisms

106
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.880 
in the Internet communication

107
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.880 
and it provides means to authenticate
the users in the right way.

108
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.080 
There are other protocols
in the application layer of TCP/IP

109
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.560 
protocol stack, for example,
online banking, E-shopping, FTP,

110
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.120 
DNS, and others.

111
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.640 
And these protocols could be secured

112
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.520 
with the same mechanisms
like the HTTP protocol.

113
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.960 
So this became very common,
this SSL securing mechanisms,

114
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.640 
so there were three of us
was therefore standardized by the Internet

115
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:09.440 
engineering task force as tall
as the transport layer security.

116
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:16.960 
So originally and technology was WALCH
developed by Netscape now is a universal

117
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.760 
usable technology which is
standardized by everybody.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.380 
hi my name is Lovisa Sundin and i'm currently a phd student

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.450 
at the university of Glasgow. and i'm here to present a project

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.830 
that i conducted together with my supervisor professor Quintin Cutts.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.520 
the project is part of a research programme on how to make

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.670 
the training of and data wrangling skills more efficient and effective.

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.050 
what is data wrangling well we define it as the reformatting

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
of tabular data in preparation for later processing steps like analysis

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.010 
and tabular data. we mean things like vectors matrices and data frames

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.270 
of course. this can be done using a variety of software whether

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's spss or spreadsheets. but we are primarily interested in programming

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.870 
where using languages like python or r or sql.

12
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.140 
we are interested in this,
because there are an increasing number of

13
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.430 
non computing curricula that are incorporating introductory data scientific modules.

14
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
and because these are not non computing students.

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.930 
it is possible that their motivation.

16
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.100 
and also time resources will be scarce making

17
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.150 
efficiency and scalability all the more important.

18
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.850 
so does data wrangling have any lever,
so we can pull to make the

19
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.460 
training more efficient? well, there is the fact that tablet

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.520 
data is very easy to visualize.
it's very easy to make graphical

21
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.620 
representations out of it and because of that we have

22
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.340 
we present two different graphical

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.470 
scaffolding innovations as part of this project.

24
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.480 
the first of those we call graphical subgoals.
it means that

25
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
for a given programming exercise you provide a breakdown of

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.560 
the different steps that are required, each step has a verbal

27
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.080 
label, but also an associated graphic. and we hypothesize that

28
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.360 
that graphic adds value and makes it more effective.

29
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.270 
we also present graphical thumbnails. directly relies on a lot

30
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.500 
of api eyes where you have to look up syntax on-the-fly.

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.440 
and we argue that if there's a structured menu containing
all of that syntax.

32
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.890 
then our performance is better,
if you also provide a graphical thumbnail

33
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.230 
that shows which operation is stored in that documentation entry.

34
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.760 
we tested this using one non programmatic task where the students

35
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.870 
are given a set of subgoals and they have to find the corresponding

36
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.350 
operation from the menu,

37
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.830 
and as a variable between subject variables there might be graphical

38
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.440 
thumbnails, there might not be.

39
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.550 
full subgoals, there might not be.

40
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.920 
in a second part of the same

41
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.110 
e-learning study. there are programming exercises and again

42
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.960 
we see that there might be graphical subgoals as opposed to

43
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.760 
just subgoals and might also be graphical thumbnails.

44
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.080 
we had assessed that

45
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.830 
the presence of graphical thumbnails and graphical symbols would lead to

46
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.310 
better scores in part one and also shorter time on task in part one and two.

47
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.300 
and we recruited

48
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.520 
forty two people who completed part one and unfortunately only

49
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.280 
sixteen people finalized part two completely although
twenty one programming exercises.

50
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.270 
these participants included a variety of different majors and we

51
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.990 
paid them for their compensation with compensation
for their participation.

52
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.290 
unfortunately we didn't find any significant effects.

53
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.550 
however, we plan on feeding these results into a much larger

54
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.090 
randomized control trial that we are presently conducting and

55
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.490 
this trial will also contain more fine-grained data on for example

56
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.590 
is one do the graphics contribute to making
the test more enjoyable for example,

57
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.550 
and we also explore more scalable ways of generating
these graphical scaffolding features.

58
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.010 
thank you very much.

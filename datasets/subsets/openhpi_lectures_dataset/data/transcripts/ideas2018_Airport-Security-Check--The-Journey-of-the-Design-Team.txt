00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.760 
Hi! I am here with David Schrade
today. David was part of the design

2
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.780 
team that dealt with the
challenge of security at

3
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.940 
airports. So, today we have a
chance to hear about their team's

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.240 
design journey first hand. And
first of all I would like to

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.340 
know: How did it feel for you as
a team when you came back from

6
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.490 
the research phase with all
this data to synthesize?

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.740 
I think airports are really
interesting ecosystems, so you dive

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.130 
into a world you don't know. Well,
you know it as a passenger,

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.950 
but it's really complex.
So we learned a lot of

10
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.220 
different (things) in
a lot of different

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.610 
fields and topics and we collected
a lot of data because you just

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.030 
have different
perspectives

13
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.890 
on how an airport could
work. So the challenge was

14
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.570 
how to improve the security
control for passengers, but also

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.660 
for the security personnel. So we
had those different perspectives

16
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.160 
we had to take into
account. This

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.200 
was a challenge. So we
came back and we had

18
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.020 
this data we had to somehow
cluster and make sense of.

19
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.530 
And those learnings were
pretty complex so

20
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130 
we then &amp;quot;knew what
we don't know.&amp;quot;

21
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.180 
And we continued asking further
questions or doing immersion,

22
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.330 
so we took the position
as a security

23
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.350 
personnel person and asked passengers,
for example, &amp;quot;What do you

24
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.340 
have in your backs, do you have
electronics, liquids, can you please

25
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.930 
put them in the bin&amp;quot;, and
so on. And then you really

26
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.150 
learn what passengers
do or say when

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.760 
you're working there. -
Interesting, so you also took

28
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.140 
again a step back and
went into research for

29
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.470 
some parts in synthesis? - Yes.
I think research is part

30
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.380 
of the whole process.
At the beginning you

31
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.940 
want to learn about what kind
of topics are very relevant,

32
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.540 
so what kind of directions
you could go into

33
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.390 
for solutions, and then you have
to validate in a kind of way.

34
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.830 
So the ideas you come up
with need to be tested

35
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.260 
and this is a continuous
learning journey, I would say.

36
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.780 
All right. So, after you synthesized
and clustered all this data

37
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.990 
and drew some learning:
Can you share with us

38
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.190 
what where some golden nuggets and
interpretations you identified

39
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.160 
and which direction did
you take from there?

40
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.670 
Well, we heard different
stories, right, and

41
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.810 
some stuck in our heads. For
example there was this one person

42
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.210 
who said: &amp;quot;Well, they
look like working for a fast

43
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.920 
food chain.&amp;quot; So,
and on the other side

44
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.510 
you heard different things
of topics where you

45
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.310 
could sense: Okay, it's also about
recognition for the security

46
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.530 
personnel. And, yeah, quotes
like this stuck in our

47
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.380 
heads and with these
learnings or

48
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.300 
interpretations we
continued working on.

49
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.650 
So basically we had then
four fields which were

50
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.420 
&amp;quot;recognition&amp;quot;, as already said, the
other one was &amp;quot;transparency&amp;quot;,

51
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.920 
then it was about &amp;quot;usability&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot;. Because,

52
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.990 
during the whole process, it was
also very relevant because

53
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.510 
you had so many different
stakeholders, to involve them in the

54
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.320 
process. - Right, so coming
to these four topics:

55
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.730 
What kind of ideas did you develop
in brainstorming? Can you

56
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.160 
share some of these?
- So, we had

57
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.440 
different ideas, for example, a
showcase box where passengers could

58
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.680 
actually learn more about
the work as a security

59
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.130 
personnel. Others were,
like, a more intuitive

60
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.590 
way of how you are led through
that security process.

61
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.170 
So, like a traffic light system
where you could see if

62
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
it reduces the interaction part
between passengers and the

63
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.780 
security personnel. Because every
time you have to say: &amp;quot;Please

64
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.420 
come into the scanner,
and now please

65
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.760 
stand, now hold up your hands,
now please come out.&amp;quot;

66
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.940 
It's a lot of interaction you're
having when you work there for

67
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.200 
eight hours a day, right?
So how to reduce that,

68
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.890 
that you reduce conflicts between
passengers and personnel.

69
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.930 
Hm, interesting! So after this
design thinking project

70
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.270 
or with this design thinking project,
how did you as a team continue?

71
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.730 
I think the way we
approach that

72
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.100 
challenge was very
valuable for our

73
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.200 
project partners. So we
were those students who

74
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.240 
are not part of one of
the stakeholder groups.

75
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.080 
So we were neutral. We
weren't those experts who

76
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.820 
judge. So we were just interested
explorers, I would say,

77
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.360 
who wanted to make the
situation better.

78
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.580 
And I think the approach
was really valuable,

79
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.160 
also because we included everyone
in our development process

80
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.990 
of the ideas. And this is
why I think our project

81
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.040 
partners wanted to continue
working with us.

82
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.160 
And, yeah, we were pushed
into a very interesting

83
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.820 
challenge after
graduation because

84
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.080 
we were able
to work on a

85
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.420 
piloting project, so a new security
control was developed which

86
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.250 
wasn't existing worldwide
yet and we were able

87
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.120 
to train the personnel
in a way where we

88
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.310 
collaborated with our project
partners and involved

89
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.810 
everyone in how to design the
training concept, which

90
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.390 
was pretty interesting and a
good learning journey for us.

91
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.970 
Amazing! And are you still involved
with this topic nowadays?

92
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.480 
Absolutely. I think
we've found kind of

93
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.780 
a passion, which
is: How do

94
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.910 
people work in the future and
interact with technology

95
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.290 
and how you transform
companies

96
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.650 
in a way that everyone
is involved, and

97
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
rethink the way you structure
and organize yourself in an

98
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.440 
organization. And this is
where we still continue

99
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.680 
working on. It's
also an ongoing

100
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.100 
learning journey for us. -
Great! Well, thank you so

101
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.300 
much for taking the time and sharing
your design thinking journey

102
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.690 
with us today. - Thank
you very much!

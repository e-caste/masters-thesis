00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.960 
Tom, maybe email isn't the best
way to send your own’s

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.580 
source files all the time
no, not really

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.690 
so, we're gonna use a version control
system which

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.900 
enables us to collaborate with
others with teammates and so on

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.180 
and we'll use Git and we will
use GitHub as the online

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.440 
repository that will enable
us actually to share these files

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.150 
And GitHub is a company

8
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.590 
so therefore, we need to set
up an account on their page

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.070 
and we will guide you through that or we will try to

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.310 
so good thing about GitHub

11
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.220 
is that you can get free
plans so you don't

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.530 
have to pay anything for that
as long as your projects out source.

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.330 
And first thing we need
is we need to go to

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.210 
the website github.com

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.240 
and we will provide the
links as usual,

16
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.440 
and then we pick
a username

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
and it is you?  it's
me and Thomas

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.920 
how does that happen? OK, so
(Ralph) It has to be unique

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.340 
as well my full name
and then I would use

20
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.610 
my email address

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.380 
(Ralph) and then we need a super-secret…(password :))
(Thomas – trying to type correctly his last name :-D)

22
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.940 
it should be correctly email address
and now, all of you know my HPI address

23
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.640 
please do not send me too many emails

24
00:01:40.640 --&gt; 00:01:41.910
and then we need a password
and I won’t show you that

25
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.840 
then we can create the account and
we have to choose the plan

26
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.840 
and while we're waiting for GitHub,
we can already say that

27
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.460 
we want to get unlimited public
repositories for free

28
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.030 
because we just want to collaborate
on open source public repositories

29
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.790 
we don't want

30
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.290 
to set up an organization and we
also, don't want tons of offers

31
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.450 
which might be good but
we don't want them

32
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.140 
so, we just click “Continue” … and …

33
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.550 
then we can turn GitHub all the
things we want to tell them

34
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.740 
but we can also skip this step

35
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.400 
so, in the meantime we have verified
the email address and got some lunch

36
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.700 
And now we are ready to
create a repository

37
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.590 
Yes, and that's quite easy we just
Click at the green button (Ralph whisper – do it) and

38
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.830 
and then we wait for our
fast network here

39
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.790 
The owner, we give it a repository name

40
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.590 
let's call it capstone1-examples

41
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.430 
and here you will
find the examples

42
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.290 
and you can download them
so this is an actual

43
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.260 
GitHub repository which
is available for you

44
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.110 
it's public, we
want to have README

45
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.010 
and no .gitignore yet, no license yet

46
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.050 
we can do that later
so, we create the repository

47
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.810 
#@$ ta-daaa
here it is! yeah

48
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.150 
and there is already something in
there well an empty README

49
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.020 
it already has a
headline so

50
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.350 
good way to start and this
is actually what you

51
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.730 
also will have to
do for the work

52
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.770 
the thing that the
task in this cause

53
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.570 
and now you can already
share that and somebody else

54
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.100 
could kind of clone or download
this you probably

55
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.680 
could do that as well so you
have to get repository on your

56
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.460 
local machine and now we can
actually start working with

57
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.490 
the Git, yeah the Git repository we created

58
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.210 
but first we need some
background some theoretical background

59
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.250 
and for that we will use

60
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.610 
We calling of Anka and me and afterwards
we will get started with

61
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.820 
the capstone project.

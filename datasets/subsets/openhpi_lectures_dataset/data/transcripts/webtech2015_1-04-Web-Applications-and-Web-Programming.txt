00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.480 
Let's have a first look on Web Applications.

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.140 
If you consider the World Wide Web, how we can see it today

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.140 
then it's no longer just an information archive.

4
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.320 
It's no longer that you only can request static web pages

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.760 
but what you can get is our services,

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.780 
a very large various of different applications.

7
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.450 
So the web has become a marketplace, a marketplace for a wide

8
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.030 
range of web applications. There are

9
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.080 
shops, there are mail clients, dating sites so all what you like.

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.220 
You can access branch software or office packages like Gogle Docs

11
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.930 
and here you cannot only deliver static documents, but you can

12
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.410 
also allow interaction with users in the actual with colleagues.

13
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.510 
It's possible to process data from users by such applications.

14
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
It is possible to generate dynamically new documents that depend

15
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.960 
on user data. User data that are for example transported

16
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
by means or forms or

17
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.410 
inquires with parameters. If you think for a search machine

18
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.010 
or for certain events. So it is possible by such application to

19
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
create dynamically very user-centric content.

20
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.830 
When we want to understand how this is organized, we have to discuss

21
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.090 
web applications. And when we want to discuss web applications,

22
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.440 
then we have to distinguish between client-side web applications

23
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.960 
and server-side web applications. These are different types of web programming.

24
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.410 
Let's start to have a look first look on client-side programming.

25
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.460 
Client-side programming means that when a client

26
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.500 
requests a document from the server, then inside this document executable,

27
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.860 
or interpretable program code is embedded and is transferred to the client,

28
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.480 
and then the web browser, that is

29
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.130 
the client start to process these data, these executable program at

30
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.170 
the client computer. So the web client in order to be able to

31
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.690 
do this needs an interpreter.

32
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.020 
Eventually plug-in is needed which together with the client

33
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.610 
can interpret and can execute the code that was transferred inside

34
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.470 
the website.

35
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.990 
We know for such clients side programming, we know Java applets, we

36
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.570 
know javascript programs or shortly called script,

37
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.690 
we know Microsoft Silverlight or Adobe Flash content

38
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.720 
embedded in the web page and transferred to the client and then

39
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.950 
executed on the client side.

40
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.820 
On the other side, we have the server-side programming. Here the application program

41
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.050 
is run on the server side.

42
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.790 
It is activated by the web browser via the

43
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.420 
web server, and then at the server computer there is the application executed.

44
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.230 
The results that are processed by this server sites

45
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:52.270 
programs which they are used to create dynamically HTML documents which are then

46
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.890 
transferred to the client.

47
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.920 
So standardized interfaces needed between the web server and the various application programs

48
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.950 
that run on the server side. And this interface- the standardized interface

49
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.140 
is the CGI interface- the Common Gateway Interface.

50
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.420 
So the application programs at server side

51
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.340 
can be written in any kind of programming language.

52
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.350 
Usually we see Java for to this end Servlets, Server Page, Beans.

53
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.500 
We see script languages like ASP, PHP or Perl and today often web

54
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.940 
frameworks are used to design such server-side programming,

55
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.710 
web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Spring, Django.

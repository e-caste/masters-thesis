1
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.010 
Now let us speak about the World
Wide Web in our openHPI course

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.470 
A Half Century
of Internet

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.890 
The World Wide Web is the most
important application of the internet

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.670 
What is the World
Wide Web?

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.700 
You are using it, you are using it in this
moment you are looking to that video

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.820 
How did you come to this
video you are looking now?

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.400 
You get it over
the internet

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.420 
You start your desktop, you start an
internet program so-called browser

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.050 
there are different
browsers in place

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.600 
then you give in the URL, you navigate
through the internet. One way

11
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.340 
to do this is, for example, using
Google to find the right way

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.990 
you can use a search engine like
Google, you can type in a link

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.820 
and then you can start and then you see,
ok, there's a lot of different pages

14
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
and here also our openHPI is available
and our course here you click

15
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.660 
and then your browser knows
that you want to get access

16
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.930 
and want to see this video
which is stored under the URL

17
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.700 
which were found by
the search engine

18
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.450 
but what happened
behind the scene?

19
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.680 
How does it work? This is a question
we want to answer in this clip

20
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.910 
in the case of openHPI, the HPI, Hasso-Plattner-Institut
is the provider of an information

21
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.450 
is a provider of information of all
the information belonging to this

22
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.650 
openHPI course. On
the other side

23
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.240 
there are you. You and the users
want to access the information

24
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.980 
that's provided
from HPI

25
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.860 
the connection between the
user and the provider

26
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.700 
runs over the internet. How it runs over
the internet we have discussed already

27
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.080 
there are many networks and request
goes through different networks

28
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.330 
the networks are interconnected
by routers, routers compute

29
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.610 
new address and a new path, the next
hop and then at the end, the user

30
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:38.190 
is able to excess the information
that's provided by HPI

31
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.460 
and this principle how to access
information, this is a service

32
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.020 
World Wide Web - a service that's
provided which allows you

33
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.530 
the user to access the information
that's provided by us by openHPI

34
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.530 
Let's have a closer look at
how does this work. First

35
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.730 
what kind of documents

36
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
in the web can be provided?
And these web documents

37
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.470 
also called Hypertext documents. Anyone
can post information on the internet

38
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.510 
so anyone can access the information
provided on the internet

39
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
this is what a web service
allows and makes possible

40
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.560 
but the information passed
must be available

41
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.110 
in a uniform format and the uniform
format for that web documents

42
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.030 
is the Hypertext or more
precisely the Hypermedia format

43
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.130 
What needs to be done is the different
information that's provided on the internet

44
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.550 
needs to be packed
in this format

45
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.970 
go back, let's continue again, you
have a letter e-mail, you have

46
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.320 
a music, you have a video and all
need to be packed in such a Hyper-

47
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.830 
text or Hypermedia
format

48
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:19.280 
The name Web came from the most
important characteristic

49
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.120 
of the World Wide Web service
that the information

50
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.730 
it is providing that the
information is networked

51
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.280 
The information is contained in
documents - the hypertext documents

52
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
we spoke about that and
the hypertext documents

53
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.390 
are interconnected which are
pointers so-called hyper-

54
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.130 
links or shortly links

55
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.120 
So, in the different places of the web
documents, there are the possibility

56
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.600 
to click and then the connection
is activated to another document

57
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.210 
In this way, the hypertext
documents of the World Wide Web

58
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.920 
are interconnected
with each other

59
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.660 
It is an interconnection
by means of pointers

60
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.140 
which are called in this
context hyperlinks

61
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
So, if we look to the structure
of the web, then this

62
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.970 
documents - the web documents
which are provided

63
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.100 
the information our
hypertext documents

64
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.410 
they are provided
on servers

65
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.930 
and the documents

66
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.200 
can be placed on
different servers

67
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.660 
they are interconnected
by these pointers

68
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.250 
and these servers can be
accessed by the user

69
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.950 
they can be accessed by
means of a browser

70
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.570 
the user needs to know which
document they want to receive and

71
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.420 
where on which web server
this document is provided

72
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.900 
so the user connects
to this server

73
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.450 
the document he or she
is interested in

74
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.830 
to provide

75
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.540 
What elements are on
such a website?

76
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.260 
Let's look here our slide when
we introduced the World

77
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.930 
Wide Web and different
internet services

78
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.250 
only as an example
of a website

79
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.330 
then if you look there is a title and
there is the address of the document

80
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.250 
this is what
browser shows you

81
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:54.710 
since there are the headline of the content,
in our case slide, then some information

82
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.010 
which is provided some
more information

83
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.630 
the more information is not on that
page is not on that document

84
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.800 
more information you can access
via the link mechanisms which

85
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.530 
provides you if you are interested in
more documents to another website.

86
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.350 
Then we have the pictures,
media, photos whatever

87
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.690 
Let's have a closer look at how
these documents are composed

88
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.340 
How these documents need to be
written that it's possible

89
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.970 
that they became
web documents

90
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.170 
we need a special language, a description
language for designing such document

91
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.200 
and this is HTML - the
Hypertext Markup Language

92
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:59.260 
and with HTML, an author can
design such a web document

93
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:06.710 
Such a web document which consists of
different information, HTML helps

94
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:14.270 
to describe the structure of that web
document provides the possibility to

95
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.870 
design headings, to design
different paragraphs, tables

96
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.350 
and important characteristic
of HTML and web document is

97
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:34.040 
that beside of the structure and the
usual content although hyperlinks

98
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.360 
can be written and
can be assigned

99
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.340 
here, for example, you see in
different colors this is a way

100
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.910 
how such a hyperlink can be
included in the document

101
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.570 
and these here shows you the structure
color these are the different

102
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.670 
structural elements
of such a website

103
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:05.500 
and then you can integrate photos,
videos, multimedia components

104
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.740 
and this is done in this way,
here, an image is included

105
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.260 
in the web page and

106
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:22.140 
at the end, you can create a graphic
representation by means of another

107
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.460 
language - a format description
language. We will not go into details

108
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:35.420 
Now we have the web documents
and the user that receive

109
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.790 
such a web document wants
to get it displayed

110
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:46.660 
in the original way, in the
way we had. So, you see this

111
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:53.350 
website here is described in such a way
and the mean that needed to describe it

112
00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:01.810 
is provided by HTML, so, we see the title
with the headlines with its information

113
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:07.690 
we have links to more
information we have the image

114
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.910 
so in this way or what you see in
the World Wide Web, all such

115
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:20.110 
pages, all such information are created
with the Hypertext Markup Language

116
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:28.460 
Another important component for
getting the World Wide Web

117
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.160 
application
running are URLs

118
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.260 
Uniform Resource
Locator

119
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:43.740 
We already considered HTML documents and
we thought inside the HTML documents

120
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.490 
we can place pointers,
we can place links

121
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:53.080 
and in the links, we provide
a reference to another

122
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.480 
HTML document eventually
on another server

123
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.580 
and for this references

124
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.910 
we require a unique possibility
for unique identification

125
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:13.520 
of the different HTML documents,
not only on one server we

126
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.370 
needed for all HTML
documents around the world

127
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:23.180 
and such an identification
scheme is given by URL

128
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:30.740 
So, the uniform resource locator
is a way to provide exactly

129
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:36.610 
to identify each of the web documents
in a unique way so that the pointer

130
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.560 
can exactly link

131
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.970 
an information to another
information by providing the URL

132
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.250 
of other information of
the other document

133
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.970 
Let's have a closer look.
So, typically URL

134
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.760 
every time the URL
starts with its schema

135
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.560 
the scheme indicates the network
access protocol in case

136
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.220 
of the World Wide Web

137
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:14.070 
it's HTTP, then the URL
contains the computer name

138
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.880 
the name of the server with
web document is saved

139
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.850 
and separation between the scheme
and the computer name is

140
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.610 
a double point (:) and
two slashes (//)

141
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.750 
and then if we have
identified the server

142
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.310 
the document is placed, we
need to identify the path

143
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.170 
to the document

144
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.170 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh document

145
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.050 
in the file system of that server
because in the server there

146
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:48.140 
are located many different documents. In our
case, its "courses/internetworking2020"

147
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.710 
so this is URL and then

148
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:58.530 
there are possibilities
to add query parameters

149
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:04.000 
for example, in the query parameters here,
there is a specification of the language

150
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:10.820 
this is an English document
in the English language

151
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.340 
it could be provided also in other
languages, there could be other

152
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.330 
specifications with these
query parameters done

153
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.590 
So, we have a way to describe
the documents by means of HTML

154
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:31.890 
we have a mean to exactly
describe the identification of

155
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:37.160 
such documents by the means of
URL and now we need a protocol

156
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.980 
for the transport of documents over
the internet and this protocol

157
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.520 
this protocol on the application
layer for the World Wide Web

158
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.950 
is a Hypertext
Transfer Protocol

159
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.010 
It organizes interaction
between the web client

160
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.920 
the web client is a browser and
the web server, it's a computer

161
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:08.260 
connected to the internet where
all the HTML documents are

162
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:16.550 
stored and the interaction between
the client and the web server

163
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.360 
is regulated by the
HTTP protocol.

164
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.860 
Also in other cases, HTTP protocol
follows its client-server principle

165
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.430 
the client's browser request the
page and the server waits for

166
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:36.130 
that request and answers with
sending the web document

167
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.150 
So, HTTP follows the client-server
principle and regulates the interactions

168
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.510 
in the form of a question
and answer procedure.

169
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.310 
So here we have a browser, this browser
is another name for the web client

170
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.970 
and the web server and browser
requests a document and the

171
00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:02.130 
server checks whether it has
this document and whether the

172
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:08.830 
client is also resized to access it
and then this document is forwarded

173
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.470 
sent from the server to the
client. Of course, the document

174
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.390 
the sender has to transmit much more
information than it's requested

175
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.760 
because this needs to be
encoded whether it's

176
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:31.440 
a text or a complicated video, it needs
to be coded as a sequence of 0s and 1s

177
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.760 
to be able to transmit
over the internet.

178
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.010 
More detailed information on the HTTP
protocol, we will give in an excursion

179
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.710 
clip for people that are
technically interested

180
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.680 
interesting to
see others can

181
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.680 
uh uh interesting to see others
can uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

182
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.750 
skip this without
missing information

183
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.630 
that are important for them, so,
World Wide Web - the basics are

184
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.760 
3 components - the HTML language
to describe the documents

185
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:07.650 
URL schema to exactly

186
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:12.470 
identify different
documents and the

187
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.470 
uh uh uh uh indicate identify c
different documents and the

188
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.570 
protocols that's needed - HTTP protocol
to use the internet for the transport

189
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:25.450 
of web pages and for the
transport of requested pages.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.240 
So if you look at the process,

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.480 
the six steps behind me, you might think,
oh, this is a normal process,

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.120 
I know,

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.560 
and my production periods
of products and services and so on.

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.880 
But if you look closely,

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.680 
you see little red lines indicating
that this is a nonlinear process.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.960 
It's not a waterfall process

8
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.800 
we usually use where we predefined
the outcome in 4 years from now.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.560 
And then we define the milestones,
let's say 10 milestones in between.

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.840 
And then we go from milestone to
milestone, develop further and further.

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.640 
And then after four years, we're done.

12
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.840 
This is not longer useful
in times of software.

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.240 
If you look at all the products
and services, nearly every everything is

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.200 
now connected with some
software components.

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.520 
And if you look at software closely,
it's never finished.

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.360 
And it's always produced
in a nonlinear way.

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.200 
It's always kind of combining all the
latest things and it's always a version,

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800 
and then the next version.

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.960 
And so also the hardware pieces and the services connected with software

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.280 
components will end up
in the same version structure.

21
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.640 
And this is how we've
designed the process.

22
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.320 
If you look closely at the process,

23
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.320 
especially at the first two steps,
understand and observe.

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.040 
This is the moment where we try
to focus on the people, on the user.

25
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
And this is the moment where we try to
find out what really the user needs.

26
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.240 
We try to look at the work-arounds

27
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.320 
users have, their challenges.

28
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.160 
And this is the moment also
where for our students,

29
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.880 
we ask them, please
spend half of your time

30
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.600 
for this, to really find out and and get a
precise picture of the user needs.

31
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.480 
And I also want to highlight another part

32
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.080 
of the process, which is the prototyping
part, if you look to the right.

33
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.920 
That's the moment where we
actually try to visualize ideas.

34
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.080 
And this is a moment most of our students
and most of the participants of our

35
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.320 
workshops are really
not trained to do this.

36
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.200 
And we call that thinking with our hands.
And what that does,

37
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400 
that moment is actually where you try
to visualize and to make physical

38
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.720 
and haptic and and really
touchable your ideas,

39
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.360 
that is activating the full mental
power of every participant.

40
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.160 
And this is so important that we not just
work with words and numbers and most

41
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.720 
of our participants are
just very good at this.

42
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.320 
They could use words
and numbers like Gods.

43
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.240 
But if you ask them, use your hands,
use your other part of your brain,

44
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.800 
usually they get really stuck.

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.680 
The other question is how to frame

46
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.280 
the challenge, how to create,
how to start with the right question.

47
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.240 
And we are spending actually a lot of time
to prepare our student projects,

48
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.440 
for example, our other challenges
for workshops in order to frame it

49
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.680 
right,
and not to make it too broad.

50
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.880 
Like, let's say, the marketing
strategy for 20-35,

51
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.440 
or so and also not too narrow.

52
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.960 
We always try to have the human
in the center to have a situational

53
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.120 
context around and to
also know what kind of needs

54
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.440 
we try to address.

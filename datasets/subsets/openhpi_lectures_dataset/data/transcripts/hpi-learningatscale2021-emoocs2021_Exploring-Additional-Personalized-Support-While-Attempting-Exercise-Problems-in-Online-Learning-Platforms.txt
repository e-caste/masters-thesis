00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.030 
hello everyone.
i'm Yuya Asano and

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.480 
i've just finished my undergrad degree at the university of Toronto

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.270 
and will start my Phd at the university of pittsburgh this fall.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.350 
so i hope you'll see me again in other conferences similar to las.

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.820 
but today i'll talk about personalizing additional support

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.500 
while solving online problems based on student background.

7
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.810 
past work has shown several kinds of educational interventions to

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.120 
improve student learning including self-explanation activities,

9
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.930 
motivation messages and adaptive feedback.

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.320 
this work has drawn recent attention as online asynchronous

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.180 
learning becomes more common,
because students often face lack of support

12
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.640 
law solving exercises online.

13
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.820 
however in classroom instructors don't just run one dimension.

14
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.860 
they tailor their approach to different students.

15
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.150 
therefore we run on randomized A/B experiment to understand

16
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.870 
the personalisation of educational interventions in online settings.

17
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.770 
this time we focused on personalizing based on
student language proficiency.

18
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
so we deployed a drop-down which appeared after
a student submitted the answer

19
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.810 
in the online portion of a flake's cs1 course.

20
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.750 
we studied the overall effect of the drop-down,

21
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.180 
and the interaction effect with students self-reported fluency

22
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.220 
in the language of instruction which is english.

23
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.100 
the drop-down contained four expert experimenter factors:

24
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.150 
self-explanation prompt,

25
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.440 
motivation message, explanation an additional problem.

26
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.370 
each factor had two to three variations.

27
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.240 
and student received one variation form factor.

28
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.210 
for self explanation prompt student got it not prompt,

29
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.320 
could prompt which is can you explain why you chose you answer,

30
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.810 
or instructor prompt which at imagine you were
explaining to another student

31
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.300 
or to instructor at the end of the code prompt.

32
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.240 
for explanation student got it no explanation a short explanation

33
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.810 
or a long explanation.

34
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.560 
for other factors student

35
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.430 
either got nothing or message of problem.

36
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.090 
we found no significant manufacture,

37
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.690 
and a marginally negative effect of the additional practice problem.

38
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.230 
however when we looked at the interaction effect
with proficiency in english.

39
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.860 
we found shouldn't with lower english proficiency benefit the most

40
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
from the code self explanation prompt.

41
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.970 
in addition the motivation message had marginally positive

42
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.730 
impact on those who are fluent in english

43
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.280 
and negative impact on those who are not.

44
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.870 
here key take-away from our presentation,

45
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.990 
first educational intervention may not uniformly work for everyone.

46
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.310 
second we should consider student proficiency
in the language of instruction

47
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.120 
when personalizing online education.

48
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.720 
finally in the future more work is needed to understand
why such personalization occurs,

49
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.440 
and to explore different need of students based on language proficiency.

50
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.340 
thank you so much for listening this talk.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.409 
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a great pleasure to deliver the

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.019 
welcome address at EMOOCs 2021.

3
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.604 
Due to the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on education

4
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.710 
systems around the world this years EMOOCs

5
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.379 
conference is being held online.

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.429 
In the past decade, massive open online courses, or

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.924 
MOOCs for short, have played a key role in the

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.571 
international discussion on the digitalization of

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.960 
higher education teaching.

10
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.012 
The conditions for the use of MOOCs have changed

11
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.930 
dramatically since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic.

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.430 
Around the globe, nearly every educational institution

13
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.169 
has transformed its teaching methods over the past months,

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.359 
moving from traditional methods to hybrid or fully

15
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.640 
online models on large scale.

16
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.420 
It quickly became clear which aspects of online education

17
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.279 
are already working well and we still have a long

18
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.280 
way to go.

19
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.829 
This years EMOOCs Conference therefore provides us with an ideal

20
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.035 
opportunity to present insights from practice

21
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.010 
and research and to discuss how we can shape the future

22
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.719 
of digital learning or which standards are

23
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720 
needed to do so.

24
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.230 
You could even say that MOOCs and the

25
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.610 
EMOOCs are more important now than ever before.

26
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.779 
For more than 20 years, the European Union has been addressing

27
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.940 
the question of how we can make our knowledge societies fit

28
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.709 
for the digital future.

29
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.829 
This is not an easy process.

30
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.589 
The digital transformation is accelerating at a rapid pace.

31
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.229 
Firstly, we need technology, equipment, platforms

32
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.879 
and software in order to improve and further develop education

33
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.979 
and training. Secondly, our citizens must acquire the skills,

34
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.379 
knowledge and abilities they need to succeed in a world

35
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.139 
that is increasingly shaped by digital technologies.

36
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.948 
They must have access to continuing training and skills development programs

37
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.979 
and thirdly, we must reconsider pedagogical models

38
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.141 
and the education and training of university, school, early

39
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.740 
childhood educators, and pedagogical staff.

40
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.229 
Only then can we achieve high quality digital

41
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.880 
education. The council conclusions adopted on that

42
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.919 
Germany's council presidency make an important contribution towards

43
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.920 
this goal.

44
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.439 
Say explicitly to the Digital Education Action Plan

45
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.580 
published by the European Commission in October last year.

46
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.369 
The German federal government has laid an important foundation

47
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.259 
in recent years with regard to its policy for the digital

48
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.910 
age. We aim to shape the digital transformation

49
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.770 
and prepare our country for the future in the best possible way.

50
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.530 
Our efforts revolve around two key questions

51
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.360 
how can each individual benefit from digitalization

52
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.610 
and how can we preserve and strengthen the values

53
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.259 
of our free, democratic basic order in the digital age?

54
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.619 
Ladies and gentlemen, we need efficient infrastructures, qualified

55
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.119 
teaching staff as well as up

56
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.009 
to date content, tools, and methods to systemically

57
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.929 
exploit the potential of digital learning in all areas of education.

58
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.439 
These are not limited to school education, but also include vocational

59
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.089 
education and training, higher education, and lifelong

60
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.090 
learning.

61
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.300 
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Federal Ministry of Education

62
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.910 
and Research (BMBF-Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) jointly launched

63
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.579 
the Digital Education Initiative to achieve this.

64
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.742 
Under this initiative, the BMBF launched a broad

65
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.784 
based partnership process which calls upon all education

66
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.140 
stakeholders in Germany to get involved.

67
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.050 
As the federal government, we aim to work in close cooperation with

68
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.140 
a Lander (Provincial governments), science, foundations, associations

69
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.630 
and for digital education community, because strengthening education

70
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.300 
in the digital world is a challenge for society as a whole.

71
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.559 
Shaping the digital transformation is our joint responsibility.

72
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.410 
The Digital Education Initiatives partner network will help us

73
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.709 
to establish closer links for this task.

74
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.739 
The BMBF will also be doing its bit to make this

75
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.120 
initiative a success.

76
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.559 
Specifically, our activities focus on the following

77
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.981 
action areas, firstly, we are

78
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.480 
investing in the equipment of learning when use.

79
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.170 
In order for digital education to be successful, learning venues

80
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.679 
must be able to access digital tools and methods even

81
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680 
more easily than now.

82
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.600 
We are creating efficient infrastructures such as

83
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.118 
the AI Campus, a learning platform for artificial intelligence

84
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.720 
and data skills, all the digital pact for schools.

85
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.279 
The HPI School cloud development developed

86
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.629 
by the host of this conference is another example.

87
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.579 
It provides a secure, functionally comprehensive learning

88
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.226 
infrastructure with minimal technical requirements and

89
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.420 
offers a diverse range of content.

90
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.339 
And the HPI school cloud is repeating its

91
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.659 
success elsewhere.

92
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.269 
In the future the Lander - Brandenberg, Lower Saxony

93
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.436 
and Thuringia will work together to further develop the research

94
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.100 
project.

95
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.111 
The digital pact for schools is an important driver of this

96
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.609 
process, and further Lander are invited to become involved.

97
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.860 
Secondly, we are improving teaching skills,

98
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.079 
the best technology is only as good as the skills of those

99
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.930 
who use it. Teachers are already doing a great job.

100
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.086 
In the context of our national program to improve the quality of

101
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.860 
teacher training, we place a special focus on digitalization

102
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.050 
to prepare for future generations of teaching staff for the demands

103
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.490 
of digital teaching.

104
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.329 
Furthermore, we have launched a qualification initiative,

105
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.040 
Digital Transformation Q 4.0

106
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.519 
for vocational educators and trainers.

107
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.859 
And certainly we are providing funding for up to date content,

108
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.110 
methods, and tools.

109
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.739 
For example, the BMBF is providing funding for the

110
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.330 
VHS Learning portal, the digital learning platform

111
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.448 
offers free digital learning programs with a focus on literacy

112
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.439 
and basic education.

113
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.940 
The federal government and the lander have also launched a joint initiative

114
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.589 
on a AI applications in higher education

115
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.360 
to better utilize artificial intelligence in higher education

116
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.099 
and equip future professionals with an important skill.

117
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.882 
And we are also keeping our fingers on the pulse of open educational

118
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.312 
resources, or OER.

119
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.260 
We are currently preparing the federal government's OER strategy,

120
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.702 
which will build on successful research projects funded by

121
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.330 
the BMBF.

122
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.969 
Our funding to date has proven its worth, not least

123
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.249 
during the current pandemic.

124
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.950 
One example is how we were quickly able to provide

125
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.950 
schools with an innovative OER portal containing

126
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.740 
a variety of learning materials.

127
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.710 
We are also launching a new funding program this autumn.

128
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.019 
Last but not least, we will develop a digital education area

129
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.570 
and a national education platform to create an open framework architecture

130
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.429 
for digital learning in all areas of education and at all

131
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.809 
stages of education.

132
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.870 
This will be a core element of our digital education initiative.

133
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.562 
Establishment of a national education platform and linking

134
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.899 
element of a national education area that is also compatible

135
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.340 
with similar European and international platforms,

136
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.530 
is intended to provide learners and teachers with easy access

137
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.890 
to a large variety of materials.

138
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.029 
Our key aim is to offer learners digitally enabled

139
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.130 
individual opportunities for education and cooperation

140
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.909 
to support them during their entire educational career.

141
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.090 
This also includes combining MOOCs with the programs offered

142
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.710 
by other education and training providers and stakeholders.

143
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.190 
And ideas competition regarding minimum viable products

144
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.019 
needed for the infrastructure of such a meta-platform is

145
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.629 
already already underway.

146
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.659 
In this context, special emphasis is placed on

147
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.355 
data security and data protection learners and teachers

148
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.667 
should be self-determined in managing their data and decide how

149
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.399 
they are used.

150
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.562 
Data and certificates must be stored securely in

151
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.887 
digital form so that they can be accessed in different learning

152
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.769 
and teaching environments.

153
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:43.029 
The vision of a digital education area thua also

154
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.480 
aims to combine existing and new digital education

155
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.119 
platforms and programs into a user centered ecosystem,

156
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:57.519 
with common standards and open interfaces that is also

157
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.669 
compatible with similar European systems.

158
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.369 
However, this project is not intended to be just another

159
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.169 
learning platform. The BMBF, as has

160
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.257 
always been the case, will not provide any learning or teaching

161
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.229 
materials itself.

162
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.049 
This will remain the responsibility of the education and training providers.

163
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.638 
Ladies and gentlemen, over the past 10 years, MOOCs have shown

164
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:34.559 
the enormous potential of learning programs that have adapted to learners

165
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560 
needs.

166
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.591 
They enables them to learn wherever they are, at

167
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.710 
their individual pace, and they have combined scalability

168
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.289 
with innovative and social learning.

169
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.339 
I wish all participants and of course, you, Professor Mienel,

170
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.830 
every success for the discussion on the current and future challenges

171
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.759 
of using MOOCs in the education system.

172
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.352 
Never have your findings and recommendations been more important for

173
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.100 
educational institutions and education policy than now.

174
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.110 
Thank you very much.

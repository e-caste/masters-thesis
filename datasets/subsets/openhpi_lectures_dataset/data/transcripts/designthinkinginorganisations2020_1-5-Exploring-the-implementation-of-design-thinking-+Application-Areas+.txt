00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.460 
Welcome to our openHPI course on
mastering design thinking in organizations.

2
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.940 
I'm Danielly and the topic of today is exploring
the implementation of design thinking.

3
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.720 
The learning objectives of
today's module are one, to have an

4
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.530 
overview of the potential of design
thinking through three project examples

5
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.090 
and two, to understand what are the
main elements of design thinking

6
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.160 
that helps to maximize its potential. If we take
a look at our design thinking implementation wheel

7
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.790 
we are in the topic of
area of application.

8
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.100 
As part of today's module I will
show you some examples of projects

9
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.690 
that we use design thinking to solve real
challenges provided by large organizations.

10
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
The goal is to show you that
design thinking can be applied

11
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.270 
to a variety of situations and
it can add value to companies

12
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.560 
from many different industry
sectors. The first example that

13
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.420 
I want to show you today is a
project that we did for a company

14
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.650 
in the automotive
industry.

15
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.970 
The BMW group challenged us to
investigate how might we support

16
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.820 
the BMW group to make machine errors more
visible and bring planning processes

17
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.380 
to a more data driven working
model. This challenge was given

18
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.110 
in the context of our master course here
at the Hasso Plattner Institute

19
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.030 
called global team based innovation in
which I am a lecturer together with Falk.

20
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.990 
For nine months the students
together with us worked on that

21
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.980 
challenge when we applied design
thinking related techniques

22
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.070 
to understand the problem
and the solution space.

23
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.730 
During the beginning of the project we dived
deep into the challenge given by BMW

24
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.950 
in order to understand the underlying
processes and involved stakeholders.

25
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.080 
Within the first weeks of the project
the students visited the BMW centre

26
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.260 
for research and innovation, to
receive an introduction to their

27
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.840 
planning and production processes
as well as their IT systems

28
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.850 
and also to immerse themselves in
the context of the challenge.

29
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.270 
Based on that we created a stakeholder map
that illustrates relevant individuals

30
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.760 
that are affected
by the challenge.

31
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.480 
Creating stakeholder maps can
facilitate a mutual understanding

32
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.470 
of challenge
and contents.

33
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.020 
We also conducted several interviews
with relevant stakeholders

34
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.870 
to understand their
pain points.

35
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.930 
Besides engaging with various
stakeholders we conducted desk research.

36
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.090 
Based on that many prototypes
were built and tested.

37
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.920 
All these prototypes range from low fidelity
prototype to high fidelity prototypes.

38
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.390 
The main goal of building a low fidelity
prototype was to test our assumptions.

39
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.190 
The high-fidelity prototypes
aimed to test the feasibility,

40
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.370 
viability of our solution and
also the experience of the user.

41
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.610 
Based on the testing Iris was developed
which is a flexible solution

42
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.820 
that consists of cameras
and environmental sensors.

43
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.110 
It can be installed on a production machine
within minutes, temporarily or permanently.

44
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.560 
In combination with a web based
application on a tablet the

45
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.640 
error locations can be
quickly identified.

46
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.830 
Error incidents are automatically
sequenced and visualized

47
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.910 
in an intuitive dashboard
displaying all important metrics

48
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.600 
on a specific occurrence for
evidence-based decision making.

49
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.270 
The dashboard is accessible through
the cloud. A business model

50
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.260 
was also created for the solution.
As you can see, at the end

51
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.590 
of a design-thinking project cycle
we build working prototypes

52
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.800 
that are ready to become products. We have
also conducted projects with pharmaceuticals.

53
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.000 
Today I want to show you an example of
a solution that we build for Takeda.

54
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.630 
The challenge given by Takeda was
how might we support people

55
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.740 
living with narcolepsy on
their whole patient journey?

56
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
As part of the Takeda's drug development
process for narcolepsy it's crucial

57
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.180 
to understand how patients can
be supported throughout their

58
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.770 
lives beyond medication provision.
The first step for us was

59
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.680 
to deconstruct the challenge and
share our initial understanding

60
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.030 
of the context of the solution.
Similarly to the previous projects

61
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.880 
we built a stakeholder map and talked with
relevant stakeholders to understand

62
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.130 
the challenges they
face on a daily basis.

63
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.230 
We also conducted desk research
to better understand narcolepsy

64
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.000 
and how behavior change is associated
with it. Since we followed

65
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.140 
the SUGAR M310 process
model, we had various prototyping

66
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.200 
phases with different purposes.
The prototypes were built

67
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.060 
on an iterative basis and then
tested with users to validate

68
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.610 
existing assumptions and
gain further insights.

69
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.600 
If you want to know more about the
SUGAR M310 process model,

70
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.840 
you can watch our module on
processes and practices.

71
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.360 
As a result we developed 'Habitual'
which is a narcolepsy companion

72
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.510 
that helps people with narcolepsy to
learn about their individual condition

73
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:08.720 
and understand how their symptoms, habits,
medication and other factors play together.

74
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.870 
With Habitual it's possible to
track narcolepsy specific topics

75
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.490 
such as sleep, napping, energy and
cataplexy, see the patterns

76
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.160 
and trends in the data, explore
personalized programs based

77
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.080 
on the patient's narcolepsy and
create comprehensive reports

78
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:39.490 
to show to specialists. This project was very
challenging because our main stakeholders

79
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.450 
were patients that were
suffering great pain.

80
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.900 
In the previous project we were
able to immerse ourselves in

81
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:54.980 
the context of the user. However in this
case that was not completely possible,

82
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.670 
since there was no way that we could possibly
feel what the patients were feeling.

83
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.570 
Therefore design thinking
became more important than ever.

84
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.640 
By using design thinking we
exercised our empathy in order

85
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.740 
to try and understand the
needs of the patients,

86
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.770 
since empathy is one of the most
important elements of design thinking.

87
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.190 
Using design thinking helped us
a lot when we were conducting

88
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.120 
need findings and testing
our prototypes.

89
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:38.390 
Now let's take a look at a project that we
did for Generali, an insurance company.

90
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:44.690 
The challenge provided by Generali
was how might we create

91
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:52.200 
an easy and trustworthy Generali experience
for the next generation of users.

92
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.410 
In light of their business strategy
Generali Switzerland was

93
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:04.060 
aiming to transform themselves into
a users centric insurance company.

94
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.560 
Therefore, Generali provided us
with the exciting challenge

95
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.670 
of changing the way they
communicate with their customers.

96
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.580 
The students and the teaching
team from both the design factory

97
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.190 
and the University of Saint Gallen
collaborated across borders

98
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.910 
to use design thinking to truly understand
both the insurance customers of today

99
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.430 
and what the fundamental problem
with insurance nowadays is.

100
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:41.130 
By talking with young professionals
and young families in Switzerland

101
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.550 
we created a user journey map
that uncovered their needs,

102
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.820 
their pains and what insurance
means for users today.

103
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.370 
After months of need-finding,
benchmarking and prototyping we

104
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.290 
finally understood the main
problem with insurances.

105
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.560 
We managed to find a gap
in the user journey.

106
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.700 
As a result we developed a
solution that provides the user

107
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.260 
with a better
insurance experience.

108
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.810 
Based on many rounds of
prototyping and testing,

109
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.600 
the final solution
was born - Bonu.

110
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:30.810 
As it is called, Bonu is a points-based
loyalty system that offers

111
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.690 
continuous benefits and
deconstructs insurances providing

112
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:40.340 
users with full control and
centralized information.

113
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:47.840 
Through the solution Bonu, we were able to
change the stigma that defines insurances

114
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:54.580 
into a new and forward thinking one
for the next generation of users.

115
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.520 
I hope you have noticed that
design thinking has a very

116
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.930 
strong focus on
prototyping.

117
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.590 
Prototyping is a technique in which real
products, services and business models

118
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.920 
are simulated in the
form of prototypes.

119
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.750 
In design thinking all results
should be visible and tangible

120
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.510 
in the form of
a prototype.

121
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.060 
Design thinking is a pragmatic approach
that focuses on experimentation.

122
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:33.280 
When ideas do not exist in
reality, prototypes enable them

123
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.570 
to be seen and experienced. Prototyping
is a way of doing and thinking.

124
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.180 
In each project we went through
several rounds of prototypes

125
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.670 
that had different
purposes.

126
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.670 
By doing that we aimed to strengthen not
only the communication with the client,

127
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.880 
but also within the design
team and the organization.

128
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.760 
In many projects, instead of preparing
time consuming presentations,

129
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:12.640 
we had simply brought along
prototypes to show to management.

130
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.610 
The reactions to this have
been consistently positive.

131
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.130 
Instead of talking about
possibilities and concepts,

132
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.200 
the discussion was immediately
focused on concrete aspects

133
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.110 
of the proposed
solution.

134
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:36.600 
This means that prototypes of ideas are
tested early with clients and users.

135
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:44.980 
Design thinkers prefer to work visually.
Instead of talking about abstract concepts,

136
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.750 
we quickly build
prototypes.

137
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.030 
Let's now summarize the main contributions
of design thinking to these projects.

138
00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:01.110 
Design thinking helps us to
frame and reframe the problem.

139
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.340 
In order to transform we get
problems provided by the companies

140
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:13.140 
into ill and well defined problems.
As I have shown to you before,

141
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.020 
we always start by
decomposing the problem.

142
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:24.100 
Wicked problems are problems in which the
problem and the solution path are unknown.

143
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.970 
In this case the client encounters
difficulties in explaining the problem

144
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:38.400 
and determining its cause. Depending upon how
the problem is grasped and understood,

145
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:44.690 
different potential solutions could lead
in completely different directions.

146
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:51.080 
Therefore there is generally no
consensus between people regarding

147
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:57.640 
what is causing the problem even when
they work within the same organisation.

148
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.320 
From the beginning, wicked problems
require an approach such

149
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.520 
as that which design thinking
enableses. Design thinking gives

150
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.610 
us the possibility to have an open
environment where we can experiment,

151
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.910 
test our assumptions,
fail often and early.

152
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:25.670 
Heeding all possible perspectives,
the problem space must be explored

153
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:31.400 
and defined before drawing any single
solutions into consideration.

154
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.400 
As we progress with practices of
need-finding, experimentation and test,

155
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.850 
wicked problems become
ill defined problems.

156
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.410 
In this case the solution is known
but the implementation is vague.

157
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:55.660 
Once again design thinking helps us
to transform ill defined problems

158
00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:01.620 
into well defined problems. Well
defined problems happen when

159
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.350 
the solution and solution
path are known.

160
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:11.640 
In this scenario the focus is on
pure implementation and delivery,

161
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.270 
as you have seen in the solutions
that I showed to you today.

162
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.620 
I hope these three examples
provided you with an overview of

163
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.590 
the potential of design
thinking in practice.

164
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.850 
Due to its potential, design thinking
is increasingly establishing

165
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:39.280 
itself as a structured method for complex
innovation and development processes.

166
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:46.770 
Thank you for your attention and see
you again as part of our next module.

167
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.120 
Ciao.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090 
hi my name is young Cho cases student at cornell university.

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.730 
i will present a synthesis paper applying the behavior
change technique taxonomy

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.150 
from public health interventions to educational research.

4
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.110 
the behavior change technique taxonomy as a widely adopted coding scheme

5
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.860 
in public killed it is used to accumulate knowledge
learned from empirical studies

6
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.210 
and to better communicate between stakeholders in public health

7
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.410 
in this presentation. i'll talk about what the taxonomy is

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.770 
what it can be useful in educational research and

9
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.250 
while we can do it in educational research

10
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.240 
behavior change technique or bct is the smallest
unit of analysis in the taxonomy.

11
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.170 
the taxonomy defines ninety three b cities in a fine-grained manner

12
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.230 
for example there are nine dc keys defined related
to goal setting and plenty.

13
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.380 
thus an intervention typically consists to go

14
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.580 
multiple vz t's who interventions with the bc key taxonomy while also

15
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.080 
to compare similar interventions and identify effective bc keys

16
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.560 
pct folksonomy provides detailed guidelines for classification.

17
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.850 
it has other well established techniques in the definitions

18
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.340 
and allows coding more than one bct for the intervention technique,

19
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.420 
for example the definition of the pct demonstration of the behavior

20
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
major's fatherly what is a frequently used term in psychology.

21
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.430 
it also specifies other easy keys to code and what condition

22
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.590 
in the taxonomy receipt is are grouped into sixteen clusters

23
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.290 
based on psychological mechanisms.

24
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.310 
this clusterings makes it easy to navigate pcts and could accordingly

25
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.320 
after according we can have a quick overview of what psychological

26
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.570 
mechanism of intervention mostly realized on.

27
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.490 
the pc taxonomy is evolving.

28
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.910 
there is a taxonomy developed based on the pc taxonomy specifically for

29
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.610 
techniques for morning physical activities and healthy eating

30
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.360 
recently wore cross tures like

31
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.750 
personalisation and chemical occasion or suggested

32
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.940 
reflecting at events technologies such as we are time sensing and machine learning

33
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.930 
that why can the pc taxonomy be useful in education research

34
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.890 
behavior and psychological science perspective can help students

35
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.640 
persist in their learning process for example
we all have some experiences that

36
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.880 
we planned to study regularly but actually. it was challenging

37
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.650 
to keep up with the study plan

38
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.590 
taking the behavior perspective when intervention can help curtius

39
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.990 
said he habits.

40
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.940 
the pc taxonomy is developed from public health. but it is still

41
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.060 
useful for educational researchers because there are similarities

42
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.470 
and interventions between the two fields

43
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.540 
both target goal-oriented behaviors and require a long term commitment

44
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.140 
in other words participants need to engage in various activities

45
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.460 
for a long period of time to achieve the intervention goal.

46
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.770 
then what can we do with the obesity taxonomy in educational research

47
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.470 
we can catalyze best interventions in his according to ranges and

48
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.610 
develop new interventions

49
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.570 
to demonstrate the feasibility of using it
as a coding scheme in educational research.

50
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.450 
we coded four large-scale interventions with the taxonomy.

51
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.430 
the interventions share the strong similarities
in their whole context and design

52
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.560 
the aim to improve attrition and massive open online
courses that reached

53
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.980 
millions of people all around the world and they provided course

54
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.030 
takers with short writing activities at the beginning of the course.

55
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.680 
our coding shows that these interventions used different pcts

56
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.030 
meaning they're leveraging different psychological mechanisms.

57
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.580 
we can enhance current interventions by adding one or more bc keys

58
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.660 
for example the plan making intervention prompt
course takers to make plants

59
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.170 
which classical to having to be cities problem
solving an action planning

60
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.060 
in addition we could add another vct behavior experiment.

61
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.390 
we can our command keeping a record of when participants followed

62
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.190 
the plan and when they did not this will help
identify obstacles to following plans.

63
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.850 
and eventually help them make a better plan

64
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.610 
the bct taxonomy can serve as an evidence base foundation

65
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.900 
for developing new interventions and education

66
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.920 
bc views such as associated learning and heavy formation suggest that

67
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.550 
we can shape a habit when we repeatedly engage in the behavior

68
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.270 
in the same context or in association with another neutral stimulus.

69
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.490 
for example to cultivate a habit of sitting at regular times

70
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.410 
an intervention can encourage participants to schedule us to depart

71
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.790 
immediately after their other daily routine such as walking a dog.

72
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.900 
a message can be sent during or after the
chosen daily routine to remind participants

73
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.780 
that it is time to study

74
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.720 
and summary the pc taxonomy as a fine-grained coding scheme

75
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.990 
for behavior change techniques evolved by public health researchers.

76
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:39.170 
the pc taxonomy can be used in educational
research to synthesize past interventions

77
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.640 
in hence current interventions. and create new interventions

78
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.640 
more examples are available in the paper

79
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.370 
about how public health research uses the pc taxonomy and how

80
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.770 
we can develop or improve interventions with it in education. thank you.

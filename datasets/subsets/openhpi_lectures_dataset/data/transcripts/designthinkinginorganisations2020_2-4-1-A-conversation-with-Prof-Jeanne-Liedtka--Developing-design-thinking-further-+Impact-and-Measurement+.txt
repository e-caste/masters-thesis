Welcome to our speaker series on Mastering
Design Thinking in Organizations

2
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.160 
I'm Danielly and here with me today
I have Prof. Jeanne Liedtka

3
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.010 
who have been talking with us a
little bit about how to measure

4
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.840 
the impact of design thinking. Jeanne,
can you please introduce yourself?

5
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'm Jeanne Liedtka, great to be
with you and I am a faculty

6
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.680 
member here at the Darden
Graduate School of Business and

7
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.260 
at the University
of Virginia

8
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.350 
I started off my career as a strategist
so, I come to design thinking

9
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.700 
through the lens of strategy and being a BCG (Boston
Consulting Group) consultant before I entered

10
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.650 
and became an academic. You have
done some recent research on

11
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.310 
the topic of how to measure the
impact of the design thinking,

12
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.340 
you have published papers on the topic
and in your most recent paper your cite

13
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.790 
you mention some
prepositions

14
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.480 
of how to measure the impact of
design thinking. Can elaborate

15
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480 
a bit more on that?
Absolutely, so,

16
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.060 
as a business person or really
a person in any organization

17
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.690 
whether it's the business sector or the
social sector or the government sector

18
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.950 
If we want to encourage people to
try these new ways of thinking

19
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.040 
and get organizational leaders
to support them, we have to

20
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.560 
give them some evidence
that they work on

21
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.900 
For those of us who are kind of
disciples of design thinking

22
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.510 
we know it works, we live it, we
see it day to day but when we

23
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.790 
try and introduce it into
organizations for whom it's quite

24
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.980 
a different way
of thinking,

25
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.770 
if we have no more solid evidence, if we
have nothing but kind of anecdotal stories

26
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.950 
it often gets dismissed, so, because
my background is in business

27
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.540 
and is in strategy analytics, we
thought a lot about how do we capture

28
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.940 
in a more quantitative way, what design
thinking is capable of producing

29
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.470 
Now that's a
complex issue,

30
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.870 
it's not easy to identify all of
the outcomes of design thinking

31
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.230 
we liken it to being like an iceberg
what shows above the water

32
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.740 
level is really just a small percentage of the
possibilities that design thinking produces

33
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.380 
So, for instance, the things we tend
to measure in business, things

34
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.490 
like how long does it take us
to do things, how much do

35
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.860 
we sell as a result of a new
product, how much more favorable

36
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.920 
to customers rate us with something
like a preferred provider score

37
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.140 
All of these things that are
available to measure using

38
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.370 
our existing measures are really just a small
piece of what design thinking produces

39
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.960 
We knew that from lots of case research so
over the last ten years we've probably

40
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.190 
studied in depth 50 at least
cases of the use of design

41
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.300 
thinking in all kinds of organizations,
so, we saw a whole set of deeper effects

42
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.600 
and those deeper effects were
often to do with how people

43
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
saw things differently, so, they
were mind set effect, there

44
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.820 
were also effects in how people
interacted with each other

45
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.660 
So, we started to think about
happening measure these deeper

46
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.470 
impacts of design thinking. Now,
obviously, you can't go out and

47
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.190 
measure them in the traditional
ways in business we like to

48
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.850 
measure which is
let's count stuff

49
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.840 
You need the kind of begin by
speaking with people who've

50
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.700 
been working with and understand
what affects their seeing so

51
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.770 
we set out to create
a survey instrument

52
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.890 
based on what we were seeing that
would allow us to ask people

53
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.740 
who were using design thinking
what outcomes they saw as a

54
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.890 
result of using it so we've been
doing that work for about

55
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.450 
three years now and we've accumulated
quite a database of over

56
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.870 
about a thousand respondents from all over the
world all different kinds of organizations

57
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.320 
to talk about what they see as
the impact of design thinking

58
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.310 
But in order to do that, we had
to start by deconstructing

59
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.110 
what we mean by design thinking.
So, we use the term design

60
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.490 
thinking, it's very broad people
mean different things and you

61
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.130 
can't measure outcomes without
knowing what your input is, so, we

62
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.680 
started to deconstruct design
thinking into its key elements

63
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.500 
so, for instance, we identified in
our research - 5 key elements

64
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.020 
or practices that were prevalent
in all of the cases we looked at

65
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.940 
and these will sound very familiar
to those of you who are

66
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.500 
working with design thinking. The
most obvious one is developing

67
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.870 
a deep understanding of the people
we're designing for, understanding

68
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.190 
their problem from their unmet needs, right?
Now, if we look at just that element

69
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.290 
if in fact we go deep to try and
really understand the unmet

70
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.950 
needs of customers that's going to produce
some positive impacts for organizations

71
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.440 
It's going to think do things like help
help us deliver user-driven criteria

72
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.630 
about what's important, it's going to
help us to align members of a team

73
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.540 
and get them pushing the same
direction, it's going to help

74
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.950 
people to become more emotionally
engaged with the people that

75
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.900 
they're trying to serve. So, when we get
ready to implement it's going to be

76
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.800 
more likely that we'll successfully
implement a new idea. So,

77
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.680 
there are all of these different
outcomes, we call them intermediate

78
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.480 
outcomes because they are on their way
to producing final outcomes like

79
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.620 
improved quality of choices, reducing the
risk and cost of failure in innovation,

80
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.490 
increasing the likelihood of
successfully implementing it. All

81
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.960 
of these kinds of issues,
so, our first step

82
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.960 
was to take design
thinking as practice

83
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.830 
and deconstructed into five
separate factors. The first was

84
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.550 
developing a deep understanding
of user needs; the second was

85
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.350 
this idea of
diverse team

86
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.700 
that pulling together a group of people with
diverse perspectives would be critical;

87
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.340 
the third was using dialogue
based conversations and here we

88
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.690 
would contrast
dialogue with debate

89
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.680 
so in dialogue, we're listening
to understand the other, we're

90
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.420 
looking for possibilities, we're
looking to build things together

91
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.470 
that none of us
could do alone;

92
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.980 
the fourth factor was multiple
solutions so we don't think

93
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.250 
that there's one right answer and
go out and try analytically

94
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.550 
to come up with what that is which is
what I would have done as a strategist

95
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.020 
instead we generate lots of
answers then we take them to the

96
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.950 
people we're designing for in
small experiments and we ask

97
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.270 
them to give us feedback and that's
how we decide what to pursue

98
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.330 
and then finally for us the fifth
element which is often not

99
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.890 
discussed but in our research
turns out to be really critical

100
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.780 
to achieving the design
outcomes we see

101
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.690 
with non-designers is this idea
of the design infrastructure

102
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.100 
and when we talk about the design
infrastructure we're talking

103
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.320 
about having an explicit methodology
that walks people through

104
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.310 
In our method, we used 4 questions - What
is? What if? What wows? And what works?

105
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.540 
In other methodologies, we would
talk about the elements of

106
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.230 
discovery versus idea generation
versus prototype and we call

107
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.320 
it lots of different things but what
it does is it gives those who use it

108
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.980 
a concrete process to walk through
and it gives us these great

109
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.150 
tools like ethnographic
interviewing, job to be done,

110
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.730 
a blue card brainstorming, right? These
very explicit tools that are teachable

111
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.240 
so we took those five elements and
we deconstructed each element

112
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.480 
into the kinds of outcomes that
we thought would likely be

113
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.410 
produced that would enhance an organization
skillset in the area of innovation

114
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.420 
and using those we created
a survey instrument

115
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.840 
and then that is the survey instrument
that we have now administered

116
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.770 
to people from around the world
and we're beginning to get back

117
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.400 
some pretty concrete and I
think very interesting

118
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.440 
research now on what are the kinds
of outcomes that design thinking

119
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.140 
is capable of producing. Are you
still data for the survey?

120
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.180 
Yes, we are and so, if anyone is
interested in filling out the

121
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.860 
questionnaire the more the
better and we have a Qualtrics

122
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.460 
with the link and would be
delighted to share that and

123
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.790 
so that we can continue
to grow our database

124
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.290 
So, there is some debate around
whether it makes sense or not

125
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.640 
to measure the impact of design
thinking. Some people say,

126
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:08.060 
"We should not do it because this will harm
the creative potential of design thinking"

127
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.670 
and some other people say, "yes
we have to do because we have

128
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.570 
to show proof of what we are doing, we need
to show that it is actually working"

129
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.500 
What do you have to say
about this debate?

130
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.570 
I was raised as a business person
and a strategy consultant, so,

131
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.850 
I don't think you can get very far
in encouraging organizations

132
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.780 
to adopt new practices if you don't
have some data to show that they work

133
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:41.720 
So, for me, it is at a very pragmatic
level essential that we begin

134
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.790 
to put our arms around
some concrete outcomes

135
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.410 
I think the other thing that a lot
of us think about these days is

136
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.690 
almost all of our database consists
of organizations who are

137
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.980 
doing design
thinking well

138
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.240 
We weren't looking to study
organizations who weren't doing

139
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.410 
well who were doing a one-day
hackathon and calling that design

140
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.200 
thinking and then expecting results
but we were mostly studying

141
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.370 
organizations where people have
had some in-depth training even

142
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.770 
if it was just online and a lot
of our courses and our cases

143
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:24.270 
come from people that we have
taught entirely virtually, right?

144
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:33.610 
So, we felt still that if we didn't
begin to put some more concrete data

145
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.900 
about what design thinking
done well looks like

146
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.390 
the risk is that a lot of people
do it very superficially, you

147
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.270 
know they give their people a
one-day training session and

148
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.780 
then they send them out to do design thinking
and then of course it doesn't work

149
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.190 
and they claim that it's because design
thinking as a methodology doesn't work

150
00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.870 
but we know it's because they
didn't do enough work to build

151
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.650 
the basic capability set that
people needed and so a lot of

152
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:12.100 
our focus around this return on investment
research has been to identify

153
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.660 
what good practice looks like at
a specific enough level that

154
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:24.130 
we can begin to do assessment of individual
innovators to see whether or not

155
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.720 
they need more help to reach the
level of competence to produce

156
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.880 
the kinds of outcomes
we know are possible

157
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.480 
if we do design
thinking well

158
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.790 
What does it mean actually to
perform well? We've begun to talk

159
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.250 
about design thinking as a social
technology, you know that

160
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.990 
sounds kind of a strange term
when we talk about technology

161
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.800 
in our world we think about computers,
we think about digital technology

162
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.310 
but the reality of it is in order
for innovation to occur we

163
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:01.070 
need more than just digital
innovation or technology innovation

164
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:07.250 
we need the human beings involved to
change as you said the way they think

165
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.130 
as well as the way they act. So,
what we see in our research

166
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.080 
is that at a superficial level we
see people doing design thinking

167
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.610 
and doing a pretty straightforward
set of activities, right?

168
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.890 
They start out gathering data then
they look for insight in that data,

169
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.640 
right? Then they take those
insights and they work with other

170
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.250 
people and they generate ideas, right?
Then they prototype those ideas

171
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.090 
and then they go out into experiments
with it, right? So, a service

172
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.860 
level that looks pretty
straightforward

173
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.250 
but what we observe in our work
is that beneath the surface

174
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.660 
each of those activities is giving the
innovators themselves an experience

175
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.990 
and that experience is making a
fundamental shift in the way

176
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.580 
they see the world, so, for instance,
if we talk about data gathering,

177
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.310 
right? We know that ethnographic
observation and interviewing

178
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.780 
job to be done these kind of tools
are very powerful in terms

179
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.150 
of us uncovering unmet needs on the part
of the people we're designing for

180
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:21.200 
but they are equally powerful and changing
how the people who use them think

181
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:26.320 
So, those ethnographic
conversations build empathy,

182
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.350 
they build emotional engagement
with the people that we're

183
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.170 
trying to serve and that empathy
and emotional engagement turns

184
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.960 
out to be the foundation then as
we begin to work with other

185
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:46.660 
people because it ships us from thinking from
our own individual functional perspectives

186
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:52.740 
to all of us having a shared commitment
to user, a particular user and

187
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.680 
a shared commitment to creating
outcomes that need their

188
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.570 
needs with some pretty specific
identification of the design

189
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.320 
criteria besides what those solutions
have to look like, right?

190
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.960 
So, we can look at that for
each area of design thinking

191
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.350 
and look at the effects, so, another area,
for instance, this idea generation

192
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.740 
you know, we have the stereotypical
view that idea generation

193
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.540 
is really around brainstorming, right?
You get a bunch of people together

194
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.260 
and they all have these ideas they shout
them out in these kinds of things

195
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.100 
but what idea generates really the
experience of idea generation

196
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.610 
is when a group comes together
and experiences something

197
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.710 
that will call emergence, right?
An emergency is a pretty common

198
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:46.320 
concept in areas like physics and
even in areas like philosophy

199
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.250 
Emergence happens when
people together

200
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.550 
have an idea as they talked
together that none of them would

201
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.030 
have been able to have coming
into the conversation

202
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.590 
So, the kind of a gestalt
effect we get together and in

203
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.820 
this process of generating ideas
it's not just that individual

204
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.740 
generate ideas and we smash them
together, it's that together

205
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.170 
we see something new that none
of us could see alone and that

206
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.750 
phenomena of emergence is rare
the higher order solutions come

207
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.690 
from that's where we break the
trade-offs that's where design

208
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.710 
thinking allows us to come up with a
solution that we could never have done

209
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:34.790 
in a traditional heterogeneous
group who wasn't steeped in users

210
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.220 
and open and listening to each
other to appreciate and leverage

211
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.760 
the diversity they bring, right?
So, for each aspect of design

212
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.660 
thinking, each of these obvious activities,
there's actually a deeper experience

213
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:52.830 
that the innovator is having,
right? And those experiences are

214
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.740 
what produced the mindsets and new
practices that allow design thinking

215
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.380 
to live up to the transformational
potential that it really has

216
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.790 
So, then I have another
provocative question

217
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.920 
We see a lot of companies trying to
financially measure the impact

218
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.370 
of design thinking, for example,
some of them use metrics, for

219
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.930 
example, customer-centricity,
customer acceptance,

220
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.370 
the number of prototypes
that you have built,

221
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.460 
the companies are looking for
these metrics to prove the

222
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.820 
impact of any thinking but what
i'm understanding from you

223
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:37.710 
now is that the mindset change the
transformation that design thinking causes

224
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:44.800 
it more in the behavioral experiences that
the employees face than the employees

225
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.860 
they see in the company,
they see in the process

226
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.920 
So would you say that if much
more valuable or maybe that it

227
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.490 
makes much more sense to measure
how this mindset change

228
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.980 
than to actually measure
financial impact?

229
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.270 
Again I'm a believer in outcome
measures, right? So, I think if

230
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.800 
it's definitely worthwhile to
measure whether your customers

231
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.820 
are more satisfied than they
used to be or whether you sell

232
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:20.090 
more than you used to sell, all of these kinds
of traditional business output measures

233
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.050 
I think are valid and important,
what we're saying is

234
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.210 
those alone are
not enough

235
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:34.440 
because those are outcomes design thinking
doesn't directly produce those outcomes

236
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.900 
it produces a set of mindsets and
behaviors on the part of innovators

237
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.000 
and those innovators then
produced those outcomes

238
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.080 
So, if all you're measuring
is the outcomes,

239
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.530 
you're not able to intervene to
improve those outcomes because

240
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.760 
you aren't studying the mechanisms,
kind of the black box of

241
00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.450 
what produces those outcomes.
So for us, measuring

242
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.900 
the actual practices, so, for
instance, creating the kind of

243
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.140 
360-degree confidence
assessment

244
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.390 
that we would traditionally use in
business organizations creating

245
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:18.870 
that for design thinking skills so
that I am measuring behaviors of my

246
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.910 
innovators to see if they're
doing the new kinds of things

247
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:28.490 
that they need to do that will
call design thinking that will

248
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.880 
in turn, produce those outcomes.
So, all of these measures both

249
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.370 
of these intermediate mechanisms
as well as the ultimate

250
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.900 
output they're all important
but the concern is

251
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:46.720 
we measure what's easy to measure, we measure
using the measures we've already got

252
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.550 
and if we use the measures we've
already got measures like

253
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.870 
customer satisfaction and revenues and
efficiency all of those, we will miss

254
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.990 
the part that really matters
if you want to manage

255
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:07.470 
your innovation skillset and so
that's where I think a lot

256
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.490 
of the measurement

257
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:15.080 
is incomplete, you know, it's good
and it's positive but it's not

258
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:21.040 
really giving organizational leaders the
data they need to produce better outcomes

259
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.820 
because that data has to do with
measuring and paying attention

260
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.410 
to the mindsets and practices of
their own innovators. We are

261
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.860 
now approaching the end of our
conversation, is there anything

262
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.640 
else you'd like to add that you'd
like to say to our audience?

263
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.500 
I guess what I would like to do is
just say, you know, we've dwelled on

264
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.600 
how complex this is and all the
new skills and things that

265
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.680 
I wouldn't want to
discourage people

266
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.550 
I just think that design
thinking is revolutionary and

267
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.240 
it's so powerful and it's
something we can all learn and

268
00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.590 
we have a lot of data from that, people,
for instance, in our online classes

269
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.520 
they have gone on to do amazing
things without ever actually

270
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.300 
having to come into the classroom, right?
So, it's low cost, it's scalable

271
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:17.500 
for me, design thinking is to
innovation what total quality

272
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.680 
management was to quality, right?
It's a teachable scalable toolkit

273
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.830 
that it can engage everybody in the
innovation conversation, so powerful

274
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.630 
So, I always encourage people not
to be discouraged, right? We

275
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.570 
don't have to be perfect
at it even a little bit

276
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.960 
even just beginning that path into the
design thinking competencies is powerful

277
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:47.710 
Our research suggests that the outcomes associated
with design thinking happen in threshold

278
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.020 
so, every time you're competency
like for instance, you go from

279
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.160 
no competency at all to limited
competency and you get some benefits

280
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.770 
you go from limited competency to like we
would call it intermediate competency

281
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.790 
and you get some more benefits and then
you go from intermediate to expert

282
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:10.570 
in our research, the big outcome kick
is between limited and intermediate

283
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:15.660 
If you can get people moderately
skilful at these techniques

284
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.600 
it doesn't matter if they
become experts, right?

285
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.760 
The kind of outcomes we're talking
about don't take four years

286
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:28.300 
of design school, now, lots of
years of design school produces

287
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.630 
a whole bunch of other
wonderful things

288
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.950 
but these outcomes like
trust-building increased likelihood

289
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.090 
of implementation, willingness
to pull resources

290
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:44.630 
all of these things they don't
require designers as experts

291
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.110 
they only require people with a
moderate level of capability

292
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.550 
So, I think that's
the good news

293
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.050 
we don't have to be perfect, we don't
all have to be ideal right but

294
00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:01.830 
we can really change i think the
world in our own little part of it

295
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.130 
dramatically for the better with these
techniques and so i would encourage

296
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.300 
everyone to not be
discouraged and to just

297
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:15.740 
just do it, right? Just get started,
get some good education and just

298
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.710 
begin doing it and good things will
happen. That's very much true

299
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:25.130 
I completely agree with you,
Jeanne. Thank you very much

300
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.740 
for having this conversation with
me, thank you very much for

301
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.840 
your time and sharing your insights and
also some of your research findings

302
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.600 
I'm very much looking forward to
see the results of your survey

303
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.760 
Great! we're happy to share with
anyone who is interested so

304
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.470 
please let's view this as the
beginning of a conversation

305
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.440 
not the end of it.
Absolutely! Yes

306
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.490 
Thank you very
much, Jeanne

307
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.920 
and thank you to all listener and
we'll see each other again as part

308
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.730 
of our next
speaker series.

309
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.513 
Bye!! :)

1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.990 
In our OpenHPI course half a century
of the Internet, we had a brief

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.610 
look to the history of the
communication technologies,

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.680 
we had a brief look at the history of
computer and computer development.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.420 
And now, finally, we want to have a brief
look at the history of the Internet,

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.470 
we already discussed this
in different places.

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.890 
It's characterized by this
exclusive growth. 1969,

7
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.240 
it starts with connecting
four computers,

8
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.720 
And today, the Internet connects an estimated
20 billion websites, about one billion

9
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.470 
internet hosts. These are the
number of the Internet hosts

10
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.540 
in the domain name system, about 4.4
billion Internet users worldwide.

11
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.770 
So the history of the World Wide Web
and the Internet is highly connected.

12
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.410 
Some people use the World Wide Web
or www the Internet as synonyms.

13
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.670 
That's not correct. The Internet is
a network of networks we speak

14
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.120 
about and the World Wide Web. The
Web is one application, but

15
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.720 
it is the application which has
this huge explosive growth

16
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.180 
of the Internet. So if you have a closer
look at the history of the Internet,

17
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.140 
it starts 1969 with the
launch of the ARPANET.

18
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.800 
ARPANET started with four computers, all
at universities or research institutes

19
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.410 
Research Institute and Utah. And
then the next step was that

20
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.540 
1971, after two years,

21
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.670 
already 23 hosts are
connected in the ARPANET

22
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.900 
and the connection was done by
some small ex thirty wise c

23
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.580 
The connection was done via
15 nodes. And in 1971

24
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.870 
I mentioned because this was
a time when in the ARPANET

25
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.910 
the first email
was sent.

26
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
Then two years later, 1973 is
the first international node

27
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.260 
of the Internet came into
place. This was in made in

28
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.250 
The UK and another
node in Norway where

29
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.750 
which were connected
to this ARPANET.

30
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.510 
Then you remember the development
of the personal computers.

31
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.200 
The first personal computer was
released in 1981 from IBM.

32
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.250 
So it is important because
by means of personal

33
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.480 
computers, their quest for being
connected to the Internet

34
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.910 
increased very much. If you look to
Germany, then the first email in Germany

35
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.960 
was received in 1983, by the way,
it was in the research group

36
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.400 
of a professor of HPI, which
is me and Vollertsen.

37
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.460 
and in 83, already
more than 500 hosts

38
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.360 
were connected.

39
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.730 
And then 83 is very important in
the development of the Internet,

40
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.360 
because in that
year, Vint Cerf

41
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.650 
at the Stanford
University Bob Kahn,

42
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.780 
they both developed software as a
TCP IP software for communication.

43
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.930 
So as some people say, 1983, is the right birth
year of Internet because it's the software

44
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:19.160 
which is used today and which has made
the Internet to what it is today.

45
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.960 
So this was developed
by these two

46
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.560 
Internet pioneers, both are
fellows of HPI and good friends.

47
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:38.600 
Then the ARPANET, the originally ARPANET
was divided into a pod which was used

48
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.400 
by civil society and institutions and the
part that was used in the military sector.

49
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.480 
Then 1985 on the
1st January

50
00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.760 
the 1st domain was registered, nordu.net
we will speak about domains,

51
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.400 
the Internet, the hosts
in the Internet,

52
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.200 
they have IP addresses and IP
addresses are long numbers.

53
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.200 
So with the domain and the domain name
system, they have the possibility

54
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:24.360 
to address also computers in the Internet
by domain names instead of IP addresses.

55
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.840 
1986 and this was
a very important

56
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.360 
decision, the National Science
Foundation, and that is NSF in the US.

57
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.520 
They promoted the Internet access
for all universities in the US

58
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.320 
and they established networks as well
as the NSF net and each university

59
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.280 
is that one to be connected to this
new network could be connected.

60
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.200 
And of course, this push
very much the development

61
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.400 
of the Internet because all the
students they play with is Internet.

62
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.160 
They developed new services
and experimented with this.

63
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.480 
Three years later, 1988,
the first Internet war,

64
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.360 
the first malware

65
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.920 
was observed in the Internet, at least
it was reported in the Internet.

66
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.960 
And in that time,
60,000 hosts were

67
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.720 
undefined

68
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.280 
connected to the Internet
and 10 percent,

69
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.400 
more than 60,000 hosts were
affected by this Internet attack.

70
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.840 
Then in 1989, it was a year of German
unification into the Internet.

71
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.960 
Already, 150,000 hosts worldwide
were connected to the Internet.

72
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:56.720 
And this was also the year for the first
standard of the new Internet application.

73
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.960 
The World Wide Web

74
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:07.240 
This was developed by Tim Berners
Lee and co-workers in the European

75
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.640 
Nuclear Research
Center.

76
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.240 
And the idea was, can we use the
Internet to provide information?

77
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.760 
In that concrete case,

78
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.560 
it was experimental data of nuclear
experiments that were done in some

79
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.000 
by the European researchers
from different institutions

80
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.240 
Around Europe. So the
World Wide Web.

81
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.280 
This was the real killer
application of World Wide Web.

82
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.800 
So in 1990,

83
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.000 
the development of the first web browser
was finished off The first web server

84
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.360 
and also by Robert Callillau
and Tim Berners Lee.

85
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.200 
So 1999, this is the year, the
birth of the world wide web.

86
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.360 
And this is also
the time where

87
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:06.280 
the ARPANET, which was not working
with the DCP IP software,

88
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.320 
was shut down and only the
Internet as we know it today

89
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.560 
with the TCP IP protocol
stack was in place.

90
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.800 
And also in this year it's the
first website was launched.

91
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.440 
http://info.cern.ch, this was a
nuclear research center which is

92
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.120 
in Switzerland.
hypertext/www/theproject.html

93
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.920 
So World Wide Web,
as we know,

94
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:47.960 
it was a browser server which easily
can be used by the Internet here.

95
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:55.800 
This was the first website
looked like this was in 1999.

96
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.960 
It came in place.

97
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.840 
But in the beginning, the usage
of the Web browser was very

98
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.240 
difficult because one has to give
complicated controls in it,

99
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:17.480 
have alphanumeric controls to
to request an information to

100
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.520 
work in the World
Wide Web.

101
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:29.760 
The change was done in 1993 and
in 1993, the first browser came

102
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.640 
on the market in the world with
a graphical user interface.

103
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.400 
Here it was no more
possible you could do

104
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.360 
You can do this with move and click, move
some hours to a point and click there.

105
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.640 
It was from the NCSA
Mosaic browser and it

106
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.160 
was made available for
everyone in the Internet.

107
00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.920 
In 1994 the World
Wide Web Consortium

108
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.110 
was founded by netscape founded by amazon
and this is the institutions at a develops

109
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.870 
standards a in the regulations
for the world wide web.

110
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:27.340 
In 1995 also Microsoft equipped
Windows 95 with a browser,

111
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.500 
it was a Microsoft
Internet Explorer.

112
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.720 
Then around 1995,
many many

113
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:41.770 
startups came up with new ideas,
with new services, new

114
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:50.620 
business models that are
only using the Internet.

115
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.640 
So possibilities the Internet is
providing for their business.

116
00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.210 
So many new companies are started, they
all are characteristic because they

117
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.550 
thought to act on the
Internet. So dot-com

118
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.300 
became the typical name
for such type of

119
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.900 
companies. Say we're active on the Internet.
They provide business ideas, they tried

120
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:21.340 
to attract customers. "dot-com",
this was the domain name

121
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:27.000 
for companies, for business
units in the Internet

122
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.500 
and also the stock market put
a lot of money into these

123
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.810 
young companies.
So there were

124
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.530 
some of these dot coms
consisting of a few people

125
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.710 
making more
than a dollar

126
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.500 
market, making higher
rated, say, for example,

127
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.600 
the stock market like traditional
companies like General Electric.

128
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:10.750 
So this was a time of a lot of ideas, inspiration, top ideas,
very stupid ideas at the same time. Some of the startups

129
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:16.230 
we know today, and they are big giants on the
Internet, for example, Google was founded in

130
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.740 
1998, was founded from
a research project

131
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.750 
at Stanford University.

132
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.430 
Other important companies were found
at that time. And then 2001,

133
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:34.510 
then there was the dot-com
bubble bursting.

134
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.270 
It was an overheated boom for
these young Internet companies.

135
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.850 
People were careful in thinking,
oh, they do not make money.

136
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.750 
They only make little money as they billion money
and they are higher rated as traditional

137
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.930 
companies. So it was
a real thing.

138
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:59.280 
And this made a correction of the
stock market in this area.

139
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:07.110 
Nevertheless, the development of
interesting enterprises of interesting

140
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.320 
institutions on the Internet, in the World Wide
Web wars going on. For example, in 2001, this

141
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.870 
was also the birth
year of Wikipedia.

142
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:25.360 
2003, Facebook was founded. So you'll
see a very recent development.

143
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:32.390 
But not with this like in the
last years of the last century

144
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.130 
in this overheated
situation.

145
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.170 
Then new technologies
arrive for the

146
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:46.600 
So in 2005, people started to
speak about the web, too.

147
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:57.670 
So research activities in the
field of semantic web, in

148
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.370 
the field of the social
web, service web, they

149
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.710 
developed new technology.
So that compared to the

150
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:14.280 
web, it's a first phase which was
statically and static documents

151
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:21.140 
could be requested, could be loaded, Web
2.0 was characterized that everyone

152
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:27.930 
easily could contribute. It
could design web content

153
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.120 
without being a
specialist.

154
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:38.190 
YouTube was founded as the start
of music and video streaming.

155
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.790 
It goes back to that time in 2007.
We already mentioned the first

156
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:50.900 
smartphone, iPhone, from Apple
also released and 2014, the

157
00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:01.720 
mobile web becomes ubiquitous. Music, video streaming and new
fields of applications arise and became an integral part

158
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.600 
of everyday life.
And then to

159
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.450 
add some more date 2015. This
is about it's a time when

160
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.870 
the Internet of Things
began to boom.

161
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:23.950 
So this all about the
new possibilities

162
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:29.810 
as the more activities, of course,
leads to an increase in the number

163
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:34.920 
of Internet users, of the
number of hosts. You see in

164
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:41.270 
have seen a number of horses you
see in nineteen eighty nine

165
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:47.890 
1989, in the early 90s of last
century. And the reason is

166
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.710 
the appearance of the
world wide web,

167
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:56.920 
provide what we see today, countless application
in the Internet that we can access

168
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.770 
with computers, we can

169
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:08.940 
access with our mobile devices. So we can
buy things on the internet, we can do

170
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.620 
our communication with
state institutions

171
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.750 
or we can learn over the internet like
OpenHPI. So it is a huge development.

172
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.310 
So the World Wide Web site really
changed and brought the web

173
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.610 
to its popularity it has today. That
is the reason that many people

174
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:40.110 
use Internet and Web as synonyms.
So the development in the years

175
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.860 
1993 to 2000. You can
look into more detail

176
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.160 
here. So this is Web 1.0,
this was a web of content

177
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.360 
in the beginning. Static Web sites, simple
design, very low resolution, long

178
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.610 
long waiting times. Then
the web of communication

179
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.700 
was the next phase. I already mentioned this
new technology with multimedia content,

180
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:13.120 
interactive web, dynamic web sites,
social networks everyone could

181
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.860 
interact. And where
do we follow this?

182
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:23.730 
And look to the
traffic and we

183
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.300 
can then say as the
next development was

184
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.770 
in the beginning of 2003,
there was a web of content,

185
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.210 
as people call it,
Web 3.0 was

186
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:42.990 
a personalized website with search
results that are personalized

187
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:49.640 
so on. And then the next
phase could be Web 4.0,

188
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:58.120 
it's a web of things, with the optimization
of mobile devices with responsive design,

189
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.800 
with the expansion of the
internet of things, with

190
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:11.230 
home automation, smart home, smart city,
smart traffic and all such development.

191
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:17.110 
And then what could and is a
fantasy speak of a Web 5.0

192
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.850 
as a web of thoughts.

193
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.260 
So these are applications
that make use of

194
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.270 
artificial
intelligence.

195
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:33.770 
So triggering instruction by
source, new interfaces between

196
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:39.160 
human and the web. And a lot of
other things that are imaginable.

197
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.320 
And I want to give us
this question to you.

198
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:48.520 
What is your thought, what you are
thinking? What could be possible

199
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:54.180 
for the next development in the web,
what kind of technique, what

200
00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:00.650 
kind of new service, what kind of use-case?
So we are very much interested

201
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.400 
to learn from you what you
think will be characterizing

202
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:11.230 
the next development of the web. What
you are wishing to see in the web.

203
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:18.420 
Eventually, we can get started with such
an idea to implement new things.

204
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.710 
So how will the world and internet
a change in the next 10-50

205
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.730 
years? What do you think, what's
happening in the next 50 years?

206
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:36.780 
reason two look what's going on what's
happening the next fifty years

207
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:44.400 
And we invite you to discuss all
this in a discussion forum,

208
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:50.240 
of OpenHPI of our course
half-century of Internet.

209
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.520 
How it works today.

1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.870 
Let's speak now about
security objectives.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.950 
And remember, the internet
offers an open

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.430 
communication infrastructure.
Open means

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.350 
everyone knows the blueprint and everyone
knows the technical principles

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.390 
of internet, everyone can access
this, everyone can use it

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.970 
for his or her own
purpose. Open

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.820 
communication
infrastructure generally

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.200 
can offer the user only unsafe
and unsecured communication

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.730 
channels. To secure communications
the user is responsible

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.100 
to install own security
systems. To this end,

11
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.540 
to negotiate so called
service level agreements

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.280 
which regarding the
information security

13
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.470 
on the internet a systematic analysis
of the security requirements

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.620 
is needed that is based
on the desired usage.

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.810 
This requirement the
security requirements

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.330 
are typically called
security objectives.

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.770 
And what is important to remark -
the security objectives depend

18
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.020 
on the respective user and user
application he or she is using.

19
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.610 
There is no general security
objectives already

20
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.190 
no, one has to look what are
the requests of the user

21
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.370 
and what are the in which way
he's using the application

22
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.340 
what needs to be done
secure this secure

23
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.600 
usage of a system. There
are some basic security

24
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.250 
objectives and
typically they are

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.410 
known to remember C-I-A, these
are three basic security

26
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.610 
objectives - C stands
for confidentiality,

27
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.190 
I stands for integrity and A
stands for even availability.

28
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.610 
Let's have a closer look what
this security objectives

29
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.190 
mean. Lets start with confidentiality.
Confidentiality says the

30
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.040 
protection against
unauthorized access

31
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.870 
to confidential information.
Confidential information that are

32
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.800 
passwords, that are payment
information that are health data

33
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.450 
private correspondence.

34
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.110 
There is a lot of such a
confidential information

35
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.610 
that needs to be protected.
So the protection

36
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.530 
particularly is necessary when
this data are transported

37
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.690 
over this open
communication channel

38
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.010 
because the open communication
channel is unsafe.

39
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.450 
So here one has to
secure the information

40
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.990 
and the possibility
will be

41
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.900 
the encryption. The second basic
security objective was integrity.

42
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.990 
Integrity is ensuring that the
intended manipulation or corruption

43
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.430 
or unintentional change for
example transmission errors of

44
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.760 
information during transport
via the internet in

45
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.300 
open network and consequently
in unsafe channel

46
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.130 
can be discovered by the receiver.
The receiver need to be

47
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.400 
able to check whether
the data comes in the

48
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.050 
original form or whether the
data comes in the form

49
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.940 
which were manipulated
on the transport

50
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.820 
channel. The third basic
security objective

51
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.390 
is availability - providing users
access via the internet

52
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.260 
to inform and communicate
with services at any time

53
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.660 
from the right location. For example
a medical emergency service

54
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.870 
or sales channel or online
platform. If the user needs

55
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.870 
access the access needs
to be guaranteed.

56
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.890 
The availability is exactly
this basic security

57
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.430 
which concentrate on that point.
Of course there are further

58
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.830 
security objectives, for
example authentication,

59
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.320 
for example access control,
for example anonymity

60
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.090 
non observability, privacy,
legal enforceability, proof

61
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.430 
of origin, receiver verification,
copy protection and you see

62
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.640 
the list of the security
objects can not be finished

63
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.700 
because there is a lot
different and it depends from

64
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.600 
the application and from the user
to define this in the right

65
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.500 
way. Let's have a closer
look at authentication.

66
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.930 
It is the task to indentify
the identity of

67
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.640 
the user to be able to
decide whether the user

68
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.630 
can get access to certain data can
get access to certain resources

69
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.430 
in the system or not. In an
open network in the internet

70
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.580 
it's difficult. It's
difficult to find out

71
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.170 
who is it, who wants to get access
and the tools that are available

72
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.730 
that are designed for that purpose
with the authentication system

73
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.040 
system. Access control - access
control is a granting the access

74
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.540 
to information, to services,
to systems, or resources

75
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.680 
and it is the step after
the authentication.

76
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.300 
After the system knows
this is user XY

77
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.460 
then access control can
make decision whether

78
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.780 
this user XY can get access to
this date or that resources.

79
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.950 
Anonymity, another
security objective which

80
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.630 
the idea is to the
concealment of the identity

81
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.450 
of a communication participant
in an open network like the

82
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.900 
internet, so that others
can not detect who is it

83
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.610 
who communicates. For some
application this is very

84
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.550 
are helpful and useful for
others not. Non-observability

85
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.810 
that is the security objective that
helps to keep the communication

86
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.060 
process hidden from
outsiders in the internet.

87
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.990 
Sometimes not even
the content of a

88
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.360 
communication is important
to know but sometimes

89
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.110 
it's already helpful to
know that there is

90
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.890 
between two parties that
there was a communication

91
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.780 
and this should not be observable.
Privacy, another important

92
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.760 
security objective is to controlling
the access to personal

93
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.740 
data and of course this
security objective is related

94
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.180 
to confidentiality. Copy protection
is another security objective.

95
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.000 
Copy protection should ensure
that information can only be

96
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.930 
copied by authorized users, users
for example that have paid

97
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.430 
for and copy protection
is implemented

98
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.400 
for example by hiding

99
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.500 
distinctive information
with which the copyright

100
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.670 
can be detected in a software or
in audio or in a video clip.

101
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.100 
There are more security
objectives. For example

102
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.390 
legal enforcement. Since digitized
information and its transport

103
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.870 
medium are decoupled,
in the old world

104
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.490 
a letter was written on paper and
you could not take away this

105
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.590 
what was written from the paper
without destroying something.

106
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.360 
In the digital world the communication
and the transport medium

107
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.800 
are completely decoupled. So if
a message is received,

108
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.960 
it's difficult to find out
whether this comes in the

109
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.530 
original form or whether
it was manipulated.

110
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.210 
So legal enforcements is to
help since we have this

111
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.590 
decoupling of transport
medium and the

112
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.720 
communication, right to link
relationship must be established

113
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.510 
between the transmit data and
the person who has sent or

114
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.690 
received it for example
to the proof of origin,

115
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.030 
to verify that the
message exactly came

116
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.480 
from this person or
from this party.

117
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.950 
The receiver verification, to
check whether the message was

118
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.390 
received, for example to
perform some important

119
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.860 
messages signing
a contract

120
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:52.200 
or a package or other things.
This is a legal enforcement

121
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.320 
and what is important to say when we
speak about security objectives,

122
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.070 
there is typically not a single
one that needs to be implemented

123
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.900 
to secure an information
over an open network like

124
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:11.300 
the internet, typically one has to
combine different security objectives

125
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.060 
to provide the right level of
security. I already mentioned

126
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.520 
it is impossible to make a
complete list of all security

127
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.150 
objectives. The reason is new
applications often require

128
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.670 
new security objectives for
example if you think on

129
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.860 
elections on the internet. It
should be a secret, so it should

130
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.370 
not be clear who
elected what

131
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.540 
but on the other side it should
be very clear that each person

132
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.760 
only has one chance
to elect, here are

133
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.620 
things that very carefully need
to observe. Digital money - so

134
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.810 
of course on the one side it should
be clear that the money comes

135
00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.430 
in the right amount but on
the other side it should

136
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.580 
be hidden from whom

137
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.660 
the money came to
protect privacy.

138
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.750 
Various security requirements
are differently weighted

139
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.800 
for each application. For example
liability and anonymity

140
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.280 
in some business
communication. On one side

141
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.980 
it should not be clear to profile
a person what the profile

142
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.840 
or what the person bought
in the system, on

143
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.570 
the other side there should be
guaranteed a kind of anonymity.

144
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:40.780 
So you see for each application
one has to think about the right

145
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.590 
balance between the different
security objectives.

146
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.490 
So the individual security
requirements are changing from

147
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.730 
person to person and sometimes such
individual security requirements

148
00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:01.370 
can even contradict each other.
For example authentication

149
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.010 
and anonymity. If a person
does some payment with credit card

150
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.350 
it needs to be clear, the
person needs to be identified

151
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.300 
to make clear that it comes
from the right credit card.

152
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.650 
On the other side
there should be

153
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:22.600 
there is a wish not
to leave traces

154
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.920 
so that others see what was bought
but both can not be realized at

155
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.360 
the same time. Another contradicting
pair of security objectives

156
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.320 
with anonymity and
legal enforceability

157
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.710 
for example legally binding actions
especially against the background

158
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:47.130 
of legal verifiable always
requires proof of identity of a

159
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.790 
natural person. Such an
identity verification

160
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.380 
of course excludes the
anonymous communication.

161
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:03.700 
So here you see that there are a
lot, a long series of security

162
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.710 
objectives and that
for each application

163
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.710 
it needs to be carefully
balanced what security objective

164
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.320 
which play what role. After
having defined such

165
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.400 
security objectives then one is
able to look for the tools

166
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.580 
that help to
implement these

167
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:33.070 
need to be implemented
to guarantee this

168
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.720 
security objective.

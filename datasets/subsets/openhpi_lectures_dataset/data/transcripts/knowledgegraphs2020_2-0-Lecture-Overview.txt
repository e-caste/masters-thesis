00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.810 
Welcome to knowledge graphs lecture
two - basic semantic technologies.

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.580 
Now we are going to give you an
overview of the lecture two.

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.050 
So in basic semantic technologies
we will first start with

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.900 
the question how do we
identify and access things?

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.720 
So after we are able to access
these things we will want to

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.380 
represent them in these
simple facts with rdf.

7
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.510 
And rdf can be expressed in many ways. So
there are many so called serialization.

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.000 
In this lecture we will focus on
the turtle serialization which

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.730 
is one of the easiest
and the best to read.

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.600 
However we have already learned about
representing simple facts in rdf.

11
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.370 
What we do next then is of course
to go to more complex structures

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.620 
you will see about
lists and reification.

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.850 
RDF many times is not able to
represent the whole semantics

14
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.640 
behind as behind something. So we
will also look into the details

15
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.060 
of how to build model with
the help of rdfs.

16
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.880 
and then we will use this information
for drawing logical inferences

17
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.000 
using rdf and rdfs. The last
part of the lecture than is an

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170 
excursion, which means this is not
directly part of the curriculum however

19
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.720 
excursions are meant usually to give
you complementary information

20
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.990 
towards application of the stuff
that we did and to give you some

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.100 
you know deeper insights into stuff.
And in the very first excursion

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.330 
we will talk about rdfa, this is
the way how you can put rdf

23
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.450 
information directly on the
web within html pages. So

24
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.930 
now let's start. The things as you
will see soon are not always

25
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.580 
as they seem. So we start with how
to identify and access things.

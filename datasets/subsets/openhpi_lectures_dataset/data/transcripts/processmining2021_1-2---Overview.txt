00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.330 
Welcome to this video clip in which we
provide a process mining overview.

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.490 
So in particular we look
at the main topics

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.830 
in process mining. So process mining has
developed a broad range of methods and

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.410 
techniques and the main topics
include the following ones that

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.650 
you see on the slide.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.520 
So event log generation is an
important topic and also process

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.590 
model discovery, process enhancement
and conformance checking

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.160 
and there are also
other techniques

9
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.950 
that are, let's say, a
part of process mining.

10
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.090 
So this course focuses on the main
and the fundamental concepts.

11
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.680 
So if you are interested in more advanced
topics, these advanced topics are addressed

12
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.450 
for instance in the online course
by Wil van der Aalst - "Process

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.990 
Mining, Data Science in Action".
You'll see here the URL and Wil

14
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.960 
has also written a book on
process mining and you'll find

15
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.060 
lots of useful information and more detailed
advance information on process mining

16
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.030 
in these sources.

17
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.790 
So let's first look at event log
generation. So we have already

18
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.710 
seen the first part of
this or this sketch,

19
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.610 
we saw it developing in which we first
had the blueprint process model

20
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.340 
and we have the process execution
environment and the process

21
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
execution environment creates different
sorts of data sources, right.

22
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.580 
And all these data sources hold valuable
information for our business process.

23
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.330 
In event log generation we use all
available data that tells us

24
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.620 
something about the process execution to
create something called an event log.

25
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.870 
See here event log generation
creating an event log.

26
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.780 
Event logs are standardized
representations of data that are related

27
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.780 
that is related to process
execution and we cover event log

28
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.480 
generation in the first
week of our online course.

29
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.930 
Now once we have created the event
log, we need to analyze this

30
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.230 
events log to get out of useful
information that we are interested in.

31
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.480 
So we can use event logs to
discover process models.

32
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.840 
And we see that many techniques and
notations have been developed

33
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.660 
in the area of process discovery
or process model discovery.

34
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.960 
The discovered process model tells us how the
process was really and actually executed.

35
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.610 
And it might be different from
the blueprint in general. In

36
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.990 
general it is really different
from the blueprint model.

37
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.650 
You'll see that we have here the
process discovery as one as

38
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.350 
a main topic in process mining.
It uses event log information

39
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.380 
and it creates discovered process
model. The discovered

40
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.460 
process model we have here and the
blueprint process model we have here.

41
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.580 
And we see in this figure that these
are two very different things.

42
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.180 
They can be the same but in
general they have different and

43
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.560 
as we discuss later there can be
really substantial differences

44
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.500 
between the discovered process
model and the blueprint

45
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.680 
process model and this is why
we have two elements in this

46
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.540 
architecture overview
if you want on that.

47
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.090 
And we cover this
also in week one.

48
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.750 
You'll see here this little star
and on blueprint process model,

49
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.810 
so whenever we have this star in
this area the star indicates

50
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.150 
that we might have a blueprint
process model but then we might

51
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.790 
not have a blueprint process
model as well. So we can

52
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.500 
discover a process model even if
we do not have the blueprint

53
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.390 
model. The only thing we need is
an event log and we create

54
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.320 
again an event log by taking a close
look at the data that is generated

55
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.900 
during the execution of
the business process.

56
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.820 
Once we have discovered the process
model we can extract valuable

57
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.460 
information from this
discovered process model

58
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.550 
and enhance the blueprint model
accordingly. So this is the

59
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.210 
enhancement step. The enhancement
step takes us from the discovered

60
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.930 
model to a modified, enhanced and
obviously improved blueprint

61
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.320 
process model that we can then use
to execute the business process.

62
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.130 
We also cover this in week one and
I should add that we cannot only

63
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.650 
enhance an existing
blueprint process model

64
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.390 
but if we do not have a process model
in the first place as blueprint

65
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.130 
we can use the discovered model
in this place as well and

66
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.330 
can take it from here.

67
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.750 
The next main activity in process
mining is conformance checking.

68
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.620 
And conformance checking is relating the
event log to the blueprint process model.

69
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.740 
Actually we need to investigate
where the actual process execution

70
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.920 
deviates from the plan from
the blueprint process model

71
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.960 
and we have here again
the event log as an

72
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.250 
asset that is taken as input
and conformance checking

73
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.980 
then relates the event log with
the blueprint process model

74
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.230 
and conformance checking is covered
in week two of our online course.

75
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.820 
And this brings us to the process
mining overview in which,

76
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.240 
well, we have a starting point
we might or might not have a

77
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.560 
blueprint process model what we always
have is a process execution environment.

78
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.810 
What we always need is data that is created
during the execution of business processes.

79
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.060 
Based on this data we
create an event log,

80
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.700 
on event log we can do different
things we can do process discovery,

81
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.570 
getting to the discovered process
model which we can use to

82
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.120 
enhance and improve the process,
or we can compare the execution

83
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.220 
of the process as represented in the event
log with the actual blueprint process model

84
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.530 
in the area of
conformance checking.

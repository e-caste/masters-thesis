00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.000 
After having discussed the
different attack methods

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.060 
against passwords, now we can explain
how to choose a good password

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.830 
and a good password is a safe
password and a password is safe

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.700 
if it is difficult to attack,
it is difficult to guess or it's

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.750 
difficult to crack.
There are some advices

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.080 
for choosing good passwords.
First advice is

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.780 
one should select

8
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.170 


9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.990 
case-sensitive characters
forming passwords

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.740 
one should create combinations
of multiple words,

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
one should add
additional characters

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.610 
for example special
characters,

13
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.430 
one should create
passwords

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.740 
that they contain digits
and what's important

15
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.030 
password needs to have a minimal
length. Minimal length it's ten

16
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.590 
at least today and
preferable even a twelve

17
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.690 
characters, why? It becomes
more important and

18
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.190 
more difficult for the
attacker to crack a password.

19
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.520 
Why? The longer the character
length the higher the security

20
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.800 
and the reason is that each
additional character

21
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.790 
increases, with each
additional character

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.210 
the complexity of
cracking such

23
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.400 
a password multiplies by the
number of different characters.

24
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.770 
Here you see because we asked
password need to be long,

25
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.360 
at least ten digits, but here you
can also see why we recommend

26
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.860 
that password is formed from many
different character groups

27
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.790 
because the larger the number of the
different characters case-sensitive

28
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.350 
special characters, digits,
the higher the factor

29
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.700 
to multiply the complexity, the
crack complexity of a password.

30
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.850 
By the way the technical
term for this behaviour,

31
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.340 
this exploding
complexity

32
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.930 
when adding new characters
is called that the

33
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.070 
complexity increases
exponentially. And then

34
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.700 
there was an
important hint

35
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.130 
that passwords should
not be selected

36
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.670 
from a dictionary, they should
not be selected from the user

37
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.320 
context because then a password
guessing or password cracking

38
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.520 
is easy. And then no old
passwords should be used

39
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.240 
that were already used in
the past because one is

40
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.930 
not to clear whether this old
password was already cracked.

41
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.240 
Following this made it more
difficult much more difficult

42
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.310 
to perform a brute force attack
or a dictionary attack against

43
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.230 
a password. Of course
everywhere attackers can

44
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.290 
perform a brute force
attack, every attacker can

45
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.430 
perform a dictionary attack but
these attacks become very time

46
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.270 
consuming. So if you have
long passwords

47
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.380 
with many different
characters it needs years

48
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.180 
to find out the password and
then perhaps the secrecy

49
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.970 
of your message
is no more hidden.

50
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.880 
This is how you can
create good passwords.

51
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.780 
But of course if you have created
password, you also should

52
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.080 
deal with a password in
a very safe away and

53
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.860 
you need to store the password
and this should be done safely.

54
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.000 
Safely means it should be stored
in an area which is difficult

55
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.710 
to reach for the data
thieves. It should be

56
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.720 
stored in an encrypted way. There
are tools so called password safes

57
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.420 
that help you to do this.
Never use the same

58
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.790 
or similar password for
different services.

59
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.250 
Also this was an important hint
because we already discussed when

60
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.370 
an attacker get access to a
database of an internet service

61
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.380 
and is able to reveal the password,
then he should not be

62
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.930 
able to misuse this password

63
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.340 
this revealed password
with another service.

64
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.430 
One should never pass
password to third parties.

65
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.510 
You remember this social
engineering attacks were in

66
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.000 
a service member,
member of the service

67
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.170 
staff asked to help you to do something
on your computer and asked you

68
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.200 
to give him
or her your password

69
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.610 
it should be done never. Passwords
should still be easy to

70
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.020 
remember so that they do
not need to be written.

71
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.050 
Studies show that many people
write down their password on

72
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.170 
a post it which is
close to the desktop

73
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
of their computer. How one can
remember difficult passwords,

74
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
for example one can
use abbreviations

75
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.280 
one can use initial
letters of the words

76
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.050 
in a sentence, here we
speak from a mnemonic

77
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.310 
approach. So difficult
passwords which are needed

78
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.500 
as safe passwords can be
recalled if you remember

79
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.330 
for example a complete sentence
and if you use initials

80
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.940 
of each word of
the sentence

81
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.740 
to form the password. Here
to give you an example

82
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.600 
the sentence is - where there's a
will, there's a way. And from that you can

83
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.060 
remember this password
which has only nine

84
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.300 
digits. So we recommend
ten but it's helpful to

85
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.840 
show you the idea because this
use different characters

86
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.860 
and it's not in a word list but
can easily be remembered when

87
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.660 
man remembers the phrase
where there's a will,

88
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.240 
there's a way and
you see the

89
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.120 
a sometimes is replaced
by one sometimes by a

90
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.990 
but you will remember this and
when you have the sentence

91
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.980 
in your mind. What are the
problem with secure passwords?

92
00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.200 
We remembered you need
an own password

93
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.300 
an own secure passwords
for each account.

94
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.320 
Many users in the internet have more
than twenty internet accounts

95
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.510 
have more than twenty
internet identities,

96
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.130 
sometimes it's even 50+.
No one can remember

97
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.150 
so many different strong passwords.
By the way that's the reason

98
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.950 
that many people try they can
use one password for all

99
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.980 
but we saw that is very very
dangerous and can not be considered

100
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.660 
a secure password. A possible
solution to this problem are so

101
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.310 
called password safes. Password
safes - it's a service or it is

102
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.690 
a program where all
passwords are managed.

103
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.450 
All password are managed, they are
encrypted, the access to this

104
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.650 
password they are encrypted with
a very strong password and then

105
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.090 
in the safe there are
the other passwords

106
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.770 
stored. Here with such
password saved one can new

107
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.790 
passwords let
new passwords

108
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.410 
be generated from
each new service

109
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.360 
and stores this and the system
will be able to find this.

110
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.970 
The automatic entry of
passwords on web pages,

111
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:28.670 
so one no more has to remember
the single password for the web

112
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.850 
for the web service a special
service, one has to remember

113
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.180 
the one password the one very
strong password for the

114
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.780 
password safe.
Now I mentioned

115
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.550 
this password safe could be a
service or could be a program,

116
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.800 
it could be available
offline on your computer

117
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.240 
by such a program or it
can be made available

118
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.540 
online using a
cloud service.

119
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.850 
So if we speak about offline services
here are some recommendations -

120
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:12.170 
keepass, keeper, splashID,
roboform, 1password

121
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.480 
these are quite famous
password safe programs

122
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.290 
that you can install
on your computer.

123
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.210 
They are basically safer since
no third party can access

124
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.970 
the passwords but back
up is not needed to be done

125
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.820 
compared to using a
service in the internet

126
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.790 
to store the passwords, if
you do this by your own if

127
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.370 
you do this in such
an off-line program,

128
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.150 
you need to be sure
that you back up

129
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.020 
the data on a regular basis so that
if your system is compromised

130
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.440 
you are able to reconstruct
the data and particularly to

131
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.590 
reconstruct your
password data.

132
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:08.110 
So the database can be moved
to the cloud, so you can

133
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.980 
hand over this update
service to a cloud service

134
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.620 
so there are different
approaches. It is recommended

135
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.830 
here, so for example,
to use the keepass

136
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:27.380 
password safe you can
use this program

137
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.460 
for free. Second approach
for such password safes is

138
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.250 
to use it as a service
provided in the internet.

139
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.770 
These are the password safes,

140
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.140 
for example like lastpass,
iCloud Keychain, dashlane

141
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.210 
which are services
provided in the internet,

142
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.390 
so the password database
is stored online.

143
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.100 
Advantage of course is that
password which are stored

144
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.880 
in that password safe are
available on all devices.

145
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.970 
This is every time the advantage
if you use a cloud solution,

146
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.910 
in the offline version the
passwords are stored on one

147
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.680 
machine, but of course
there's also a disadvantage.

148
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.630 
The service provide rand the
attacker may have access

149
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.470 
to all your passwords in such
an online passwords safe.

150
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.670 
So it's your choice in any
case you should select good

151
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.910 
strong passwords and
there are means

152
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.510 
like this password
safe that help you

153
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.270 
to deal and manage such
strong passwords for you.

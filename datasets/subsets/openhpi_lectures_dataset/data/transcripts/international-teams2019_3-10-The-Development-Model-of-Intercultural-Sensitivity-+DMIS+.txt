00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.140 
OK, Hanadi. We have spoken already
about intercultural competences,

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.400 
is there any way to develop a
kind of sensitivity on that?

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.570 
.....Yes, actually there is a model
called Bennetts model of Intercultural

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.030 
sensitivity it is about developing
intercultural sensitivity.

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.720 
It basically consists of six
steps, it's how you deal with

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.650 
other cultures and you
start by denying

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.740 
the culture you're dealing with
or any culture and then you

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.970 
move to defend your own culture
until you come to accept

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.630 
differences, then focus on
similarities in the minimization

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.120 
and then you accept the culture
you adapt to it and finally,

11
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.390 
integrate. So we will go through
these six stages in detail.

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.800 
The first stage is called denial,
well actually at this stage

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.460 
people deny any other culture they
don't see that other cultures.

14
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.200 
.......They are the only ones .....They
are the only ones and they are the

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.460 
only real culture. So, they fail to
see these cultural differences

16
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.720 
and they isolate themselves
from these other groups.

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.900 
That's why they ignore
everything, so you might

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.420 
hear them saying, I don't consider
that cultural differences

19
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.660 
exist at all, and in order
to move out of this stage

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.230 
we need to educate ourselves about....
you can move out, you can move forward.

21
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.260 
Yes, you can move
out of this stage

22
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.430 
by educating ourselves about
other cultures and explore the

23
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.900 
differences between us and others.
For managers, for example,

24
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.340 
If they have a new college coming
from another country, as

25
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.060 
a manager can create, like using
triggers to create curiosity

26
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.310 
among local employees, so
they can learn more about

27
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.480 
the other colleagues culture.
In schools, for example,

28
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.590 
the teacher can use some
triggers to encourage

29
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.030 
their students to just
be more open and

30
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.280 
started like realizing the
differences between their culture

31
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.470 
and other cultures. However, if you
move out you go to the defense

32
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.870 
you are still a bit worried. You
don't except, you don't fully

33
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.370 
accept. So you still see your
culture as the superior one,

34
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.170 
is the only correct one,
is the only good one.

35
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.880 
...There will still be a kind of king
there.... Yes, and you start criticizing

36
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.570 
other cultures. You don't
accept them, you don't like

37
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.360 
them, you do lots of stereotyping about
them, you be critical at this stage

38
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.690 
and because you would be feeling
threatened by these cultures.

39
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.790 
So, but also like to deal
with this and move out.

40
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.630 
We need to be able to
manage this anxiety.

41
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.430 
You need to practice some techniques,
how to manage this anxiety

42
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.100 
about other cultures, and how to
embrace tolerance and patience

43
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.210 
for people from
other cultures.

44
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.730 
....They are not a threat or something?....No, you
need to convince yourself they are not a threat.

45
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.670 
once you do that you
move to minimization

46
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.990 
here you start actually focusing
on the similarities what's

47
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.430 
common between me and the other
person and you start realizing

48
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.210 
like here everyone is equal
you believe in that

49
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.680 
and that's why actually this
stage is the hardest to come

50
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.300 
out from because people at this
stage think they are doing

51
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.720 
ok now strong people is not
required yet they believe

52
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.880 
that but is like no they are not
but it's really hard to move

53
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.460 
out of this and in
order to move out

54
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.120 
we need to develop
cultural self awareness

55
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.460 
you need to focus also on differences
not only on similarities

56
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.790 
the communities you found
with the other culture

57
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.860 
so you would be able to understand
different situations in

58
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.900 
case of conflict and also
like we need to strengthen

59
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.410 
our listening skills,
so you listen well

60
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.390 
don't interpret according to
your own culture...be more

61
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.760 
careful....yes try to be more
open minded, acceptance comes

62
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.720 
next after you are fully
aware of your own cultural

63
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.980 
identity then you start to
accept other cultures.

64
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.810 
And here curiosity plays
a great role because

65
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.300 
the more you become curious about
the other cultures the more

66
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.880 
you will develop like some respect
to their values and their

67
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.740 
and their beliefs. But in
order to move up as well

68
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.870 
we need to gain culturally
specific knowledge that's why we

69
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.610 
said like curiosity the
more you read about the

70
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.150 
this specific culture the more
you become curious and you want

71
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.970 
to learn more. We must also have
respect for the for them their

72
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.280 
beliefs and values as
we said, so we would

73
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.570 
a deliberate ambiguity
in this situation.

74
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.770 
We wouldn't feel like
it's completely like

75
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.360 
aliens are coming.
Adaptation

76
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.420 
comes next because here
you start adopting

77
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.260 
the values of the new culture, you
accept them and then you start

78
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.200 
adopting them and develop your
appropriate behaviour. You

79
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.720 
become more sensitive and once
you fully understand this

80
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.940 
you become a better communicator
with colleagues from

81
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.560 
another culture you know and this
actually allows you to see

82
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.560 
the world from the point
of view of the other.

83
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.100 
So you would hear people
saying for example

84
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.610 
i have to change my approach in
order to communicate better

85
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.780 
with my colombian colleague,
like if you have

86
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.030 
a new colleague at least you
believe that it's your

87
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.910 
responsibility to change your
approach so you could actually

88
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.760 
deal with your colleagues.....
and interact in a proper way.

89
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.000 
And in order to get out, to
move out of this stage we

90
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.190 
must be able to experience empathy
and procedure is very important

91
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.070 
like you need to be emphasized
with people from other cultures

92
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.630 
put yourself in their
shoes understand them

93
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.890 
understand how they think
how they work how they eat

94
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.400 
what their values are and
that's where you will be able

95
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.270 
actually to move up
and you become more

96
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.250 
aware of everything and
on this stage you might

97
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.230 
be able to integrate to fully
integrate in this culture

98
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.950 
however only very few people
achieve the parties.....Why?....

99
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.050 
it's just hard to be
hundred percent

100
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.570 
fully integrated in a new culture,
it is like you were born there

101
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.140 
and that's why it's
very rare for people

102
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.840 
to achieve. And usually people
who achieve this status

103
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.390 
we call them culture
mediators they can be

104
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.070 
the link between people who
are still in the very

105
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.780 
early states for example and
people from other cultures they

106
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.570 
can ease the communication between
them they can teach you about

107
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.830 
other culture, they like actually
to help others understand

108
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.460 
different cultures and promote
unity between those two..

109
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.020 
it means to make the whole transition easier.....
and they believe they are always in

110
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.770 
process, they keep
improving themselves

111
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.160 
....they are not a product finished....
no.... this is fascinating Hanadi,

112
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.180 
great that we saw in the past
that we have different cultures

113
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.250 
but then there's an inside how
to deal with these difference

114
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.040 
in the culture and there is
indeed, there are tools

115
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.070 
or ways to approach this situation,
I believe there in the community

116
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.930 
you may have some already situation
in the past where you need

117
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.520 
to deal with colleagues
in a different way

118
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.250 
please join the discussion share
with us we will be looking

119
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.830 
for that thank you Hanadi,
thank you Salim!

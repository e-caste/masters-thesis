00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.990 
Ok Hanadi, after talking about
culture is there any way to measure

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.720 
culture between different countries?.....
yes indeed actually a number

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.930 
of attempts have been made to
combine these cultural differences

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.160 
between countries, but the most
used and well known framework

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.200 
is called the Hofstede's Cultural
Dimensions framework and is

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.290 
being used widely in
academia and professions

7
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.250 
a it's simply a series that
looks at unique aspects

8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.250 
of culture and rate them on
a scale for dimensions

9
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.000 
so basically you can compare
a country to another

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.570 
based on this scale, based on the
culture of the of the company

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.480 
of the countries. So his theory
is that different countries

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.260 
have different cultures and they
have different value systems

13
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.470 
and that's why he collected
data over a decade

14
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.930 
from forty countries because he
was working for a big company

15
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.350 
that has branches all over the world
so he collected these cultural

16
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.850 
data analyzed it and he
came up with this model

17
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.180 
So we will go through the six
stages, because it's it consists

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.510 
of six stages and the let's talk
first about the first two

19
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.220 
power distance and collectivism
vs individualism

20
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.470 
polar distance, basically is
how the less powerful people

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.790 
in the society accept and expect
the power is distributed

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.690 
unequally,... yes so for some countries
let's say China for example

23
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.620 
actually people there,
they expect inequality

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.630 
so the hierarchy in business
in companies in jobs even in

25
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.520 
schools, people tend to accept
that they have a superior

26
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.320 
while on the other hand
let's say Denmark

27
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.420 
they don't accept that like managers
treat employees as equals

28
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
the relationship is informal while in
China is very formal... It means China

29
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.670 
will have a high PDI?... actually
yes it comes with eighty points on

30
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.980 
this dimension, it's
on a very high level

31
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.250 
a Denmark is not like the managers
in Denmark treat employees

32
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.180 
they believe they are coaches
they are not managers they

33
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.890 
are not superiors... mentors.....
yet they mentor the work and the

34
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.840 
employees themselves also expect
to be treated equally and

35
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.940 
there is no much difference
between them and their manager

36
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.080 
and manager relies a lot on
the teamwork so let's let's

37
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.960 
compare like a little bit so as
we said the four countries

38
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.690 
who sit on the high pedia people
accept this hierarchical order

39
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.260 
companies usually are centralised
and every one has a place,

40
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.950 
so they believe
this is my rule

41
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.380 
I cannot overcome my boss yes
and usually there is a large

42
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.160 
gap in compensation between
the.... salaries.. yes

43
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.530 
while on the other hand countries
that sit on the low PDI

44
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.980 
people actually try to equalize
this distribution of power

45
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.190 
and the companies in
general are decentralized

46
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.570 
and they demand justification
for inequality in

47
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.870 
case it happens and superiors
and employees are considered

48
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.460 
almost as equals.... and does it happen
only at organizations? or is also

49
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.380 
in a different level.... no
it's like a cultural attitude

50
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.050 
in general, so for example let's
talk about family and the hi PDI

51
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.880 
usually the children
obey their parents.

52
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.420 
The children are not supposed
actually to express their opinions

53
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.360 
or even their feelings. The
parents control everything

54
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.990 
ah so that's why, like mentally
they depend on their seniors

55
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.680 
so the kids depend on their
parents or parents depending on

56
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.240 
their parents there is a higher
degree of respect for seniors

57
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.280 
in the country as a
cultural attitude

58
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.590 
while on the low PDI, in the
family you are treated

59
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.300 
equally like parents give freedom
to their children to express

60
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.110 
their opinion to discuss anything.....
boy, girls, parents...

61
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.550 
It doesn't matter everyone is
equal, they can express whatever

62
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.500 
thoughts they have and
that's why mentally

63
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.490 
they race their kids to have a sort of
independence... but now you mention

64
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.770 
kids, i believe that it
starts also at the

65
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.970 
school... yes yes sure, in the
school are usually in the hi PDI

66
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.580 
students respect
their teachers

67
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.740 
they see them also as superiors and
teachers take all responsibility

68
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
of planning, delivering
the lessons you know

69
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.720 
and they measure the quality of
learning by the excellence

70
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.330 
of the students like my high
grades let's say for example

71
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.740 
while in the low PDI the quality
of learning depends on

72
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.150 
communication between the teacher
and the student. It is like an

73
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.930 
open discussion, teachers expect
the students to be part of

74
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.520 
the learning experience not just
giving them orders or giving

75
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.880 
this idea is really relevant when
we work in a remote teamwork

76
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.020 
in remote environments
because if

77
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.360 
you don't consider these elements
when you're interacting you

78
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.590 
may go into the wrong direction
yes yes you're right

79
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.320 
like some countries that sit
on a high level as well like

80
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.900 
African, Asian, Latin
American, Arab countries

81
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.410 
Those are where? low or high?... High, the
low you could say are like northern Europe

82
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.010 
ok Denmark, Sweden.... yes and
now let's move to the next

83
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.500 
dimension is called Individualism
versus collectivism.

84
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.840 
so the name I think reflects
somehow the meaning

85
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.700 
yeah it's like me versus the
group, like how personal needs

86
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.810 
and goals are prioritized
versus the needs

87
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.170 
and goals of the group this
could be your community could

88
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.750 
be your society or country
or organization.

89
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.760 
so it's all about like me and
them. Individualism represents

90
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.860 
a preference for a loosely net social
framework in which individuals

91
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.470 
are expected to take care
of only themselves

92
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.120 
or their immediate family members
yes.. it is a kind of egoism

93
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.580 
yes yes exactly while the
collectivism on the other hand

94
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.200 
actually they expect a group
to take care of them

95
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.640 
and exchange of their loyalty
to the group. So it's like

96
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.270 
a large community every one
takes care of the others

97
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.290 
is my feeling that in the remote
team work the collectiveness

98
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.370 
will feel better in the
interaction, well it depends

99
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.270 
it has also some Pros and
Cons for example like

100
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.420 
collectivism sometimes you don't
express your own feelings

101
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.870 
because you are afraid that
the group will get hurt

102
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.860 
ok.... yeah so let's see some
differences,.... individualism like

103
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.760 
there is always a high respect
for people's time and their

104
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.270 
need for freedom and you should
respect their privacy you know

105
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.260 
and also they focus on
their own goals like

106
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.560 
I want... it is my achievement.....
absolutely absolutely

107
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.940 
so when dealing with a person
who comes from individualism

108
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.940 
culture, don't seek personal
information don't try to ask

109
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.220 
them about something first......
this is what you mean appreciation

110
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.340 
of privacy,..... exactly because this
way the might feel like offended

111
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.410 
like you are... you know
crossing the line you're not

112
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.830 
supposed to ask about
anything personal

113
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.740 
while for people who come
from a collectivist

114
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.970 
society it's ok, because they share
and they take more responsibility

115
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.630 
for each other so
they will express

116
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.320 
but I mean, not their own
feeling that may hurt

117
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.300 
the group but if they
have a personal matter

118
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.140 
they expect you to help them,...
ok,... as long as it doesn't

119
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.250 
come in the way of.....
it's really collectivism

120
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.530 
and collaboration within the
collectivity.... yes yes

121
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.200 
so in the individual society
success is measured by how

122
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.650 
far one stands out of the group
because it's about me, it's

123
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.740 
about the person the
individual so you would

124
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.400 
see lots of flake self-made
millionaires for example

125
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.160 
or recognition like
employees of the month

126
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.510 
while in the collectivism the
success is measured by one's

127
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.320 
contribution to the group like a
hero in the country you know

128
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.380 
and communication
styles usually in the

129
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.210 
collectivism is indirect,
so you would use

130
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.670 
in your sentence like there
is such as sometimes

131
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.650 
probably so you don't express
your disagreement immediately

132
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.530 
if you're talking to your group....
then let me ask you something someone

133
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.010 
with individuals will fit
in a collective team

134
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.360 
well that's why we are
trying to improve our

135
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.580 
competence, so once you know
about all these differences

136
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.150 
and we will talk later how what is
exactly intercultural competence

137
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.550 
and how to develop sensitivity,
then you will know how it can be

138
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:09.250 
so that was in general....
this is fantastic Hanadi

139
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.240 
do you think in the community
we would find someone sharing

140
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.880 
in different ways
please join us in the

141
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.930 
discussion, the team leaders
that you have ,your colleagues

142
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.420 
how do you think are treated in
the same direction do you see

143
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.720 
in your society sits on the
individuals or in the collective

144
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.100 
please share we are looking for
thank you Hanadi, thank you

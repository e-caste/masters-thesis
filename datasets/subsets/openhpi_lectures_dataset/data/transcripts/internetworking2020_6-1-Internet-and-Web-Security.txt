00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940 
Welcome to the last week of our openHPI
course - A Half Century of Internet

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.670 
How it Works Today; and in this
last week we want to concentrate

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.720 
ourselves to internet
and web security

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.930 
It's a really
important topic

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.010 
you can see this when we look into
a few examples of Data Breaches.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.200 
So, one was from the
Marriott Hotel

7
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.200 


8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.660 
chain. So, in March 2020,
the hospitality company

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.910 
Marriott confirmed a massive data breach
that affected their customer's personal

10
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
information and data

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
So, hackers capture the login
credentials of 2 Marriott employees

12
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.360 
and misusing these

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.470 
credentials they were able
to get access to the

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.690 
company's user database

15
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.060 
So, the total number of affected
accounts were more than 5

16
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.330 
million. 5 million customers
from Marriott, the data were

17
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.030 
published on the internet. So,
the stolen data included

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.490 
the names of the customers' addresses,
phone numbers, date of birth,

19
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.940 
travel information,
loyalty member data.

20
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
Fortunately, no
payment data.

21
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.660 
Or another security
incident

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.510 
Twitter Bitcoin Scam

23
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.170 
This was also, you could read it in
every newspaper, it happened in July

24
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.220 
2020. About 130 high-profile
Twitter accounts were compromised

25
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.300 
and misused for
a Bitcoin scam

26
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.300 
So, what happened? The attackers successfully
performed social engineering attacks

27
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.790 
on Twitter employees and by means of
this social engineering attacks

28
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.920 
they were able to gain access to
Twitter's administrative tools

29
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.080 
and misusing these tools, they
were able to post tweets

30
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.480 
to post tweets directly in the
name of a specific account

31
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.210 
So, here was such an example of sent
messages from the account from Bill Gates

32
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.770 
So, affected are accounts from
a number of prominent persons

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.310 
Barack Obama, Bill Gates,
Jeff Bezos and companies

34
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.060 
like Apple and Uber,
and the posted tweets

35
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.540 
pretended to offer a charitable
opportunity to double money via Bitcoin

36
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.760 
So, it was a huge
scandal, more

37
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.680 
about 12.86

38
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.680 
twelve uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

39
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:07.860 
12.86 Bitcoins, this was more than
100 thousand dollars, were sent

40
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.360 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

41
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.860 
point eighty six bitcoins this was balls and
one hundred thousand dollar where sent

42
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.090 
to the attackers' wallet and they made
it a big story around the world

43
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.110 
Another example is a
recent security breach,

44
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.640 
security flaw in a video
conference software

45
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.590 
During the COVID-19 pandemic and
the resulting work in home office

46
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.870 
video conferencing software became
very popular and used in any context

47
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.220 
but the problem was that although
confidential information can be

48
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
and was exchanged during
these conferences

49
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.970 
So, video conferences must be well
secured if attackers get access

50
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.680 
to what's going on then they also
hear what people speak about

51
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.440 
and they can make it to get
confidential information

52
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.770 
to know confidential
information

53
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.110 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

54
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.770 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh confidential information

55
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.270 
So, the increasing popularity of
conference software, for example,

56
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.050 
Zoom lead to the disclosure
of security flaws

57
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.650 
So, software providers and users
were required to provide or

58
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.450 
install security updates as soon
as possible before more and

59
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.640 
more such vulnerabilities were
detected and it could be

60
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.450 
closed and could be repaired
by means of updates but the

61
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.000 
user had to update
their systems

62
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100 
So, what are the security risk and
dangers of the internet in general?

63
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.940 
Though the internet poses many
different risks for its users -

64
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.640 
fraud, scam, data identity
theft, spionage

65
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.210 
So, all internet users
should know - WHERE

66
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.250 
are the risk and dangers, they
should know HOW to recognize them

67
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.700 
and they should know WHAT can
be done to protect from them

68
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.460 
So, these exactly are the topics we
want to discuss in the starting week

69
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:32.320 
So, Verizon is the company that publishes
Annual Security Incident Analysis Reports

70
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.640 
trying to get information and presenting
this information about incidents

71
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.290 
Last list was published - the
incidents in the year 2019

72
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.950 
last year, so, they accounted and
mentioned in their report 32

73
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.940 
thousand security
breaks

74
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.510 
almost 4 thousand
confirmed data theft

75
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.840 
So, the most common attacks were Denial
of Service (DoS) attacks, Phishing

76
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.190 
this is a social engineering attack
and social engineering in general

77
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.130 
So, the most common hacking attacks
are the usage of storing excess data

78
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.710 
to break into other systems and take
advantage of software vulnerabilities

79
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.590 
and the use of
backdoors

80
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.530 
The most common malware attacks
by means of malicious software

81
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.090 
or e-mail link, direct install,
download by malware and the most

82
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.700 
common social engineering attacks
reported in this Verizon

83
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.910 
report are Phishing, Fake
pre-text and others

84
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.360 
So, about all these topics we
want to speak in this week,

85
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:03.230 
so, internet security requires - why
is the internet a popular target?

86
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.810 
We will discuss what are the
most common risk and how

87
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.700 
can we recognize them? What
different types of attacks exist

88
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.290 
and how we can protect from them?
Who are the attackers? All these

89
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.820 
is interesting to know to win one thing
- how to secure your own account? How

90
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.390 
to secure your
own systems?

91
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:35.150 
The communication on the
internet how we can protect

92
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.750 
exchange of information and communication
with others? How to protect ourself

93
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.570 
on the internet? This is what we
want to discuss in the coming

94
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.080 
last week of our openHPI course
- A Half Century of Internet

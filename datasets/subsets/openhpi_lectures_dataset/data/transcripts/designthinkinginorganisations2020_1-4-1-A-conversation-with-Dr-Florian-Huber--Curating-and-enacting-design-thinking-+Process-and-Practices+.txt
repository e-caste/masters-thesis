00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:24.540 
Welcome to our speaker series on mastering
design thinking in organizations.

2
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.160 
I'm Danielly de Paula and
here we have Falk. Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.560 
And we're also together with Florian Huber
from the PwC IXDS. Florian

4
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.790 
can you please introduce yourself
and talk a little bit why

5
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.320 
you are here
with us today?

6
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.570 
My name is Florian, I work
at PwC IXDS, which is

7
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.080 
a little weird combination. So
IXDS was independent

8
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.370 
design studio until earlier this
year and then for many

9
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.820 
reasons and we join PwC,
specifically the experience center.

10
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.520 
So now we're part of the larger PwC
universal and we are trying to push

11
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.440 
design and experienced
perspective on new products and

12
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.870 
business in general and into PwC
and especially into projects

13
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.570 
as an internal service centre and
we still do our own projects.

14
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.090 
And my background before
joining PwC IXDS was more

15
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.610 
in academia. So for almost six
years I ran a training program

16
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.830 
in Munich that focused on
entrepreneurship and design-thinking.

17
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.700 
So a slightly different
perspective on its and I ran the

18
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.840 
program and mentored many of
the runners and start-ups

19
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.040 
that came out of the incubator. Over
there and at the beginning

20
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.940 
of their journey almost ten
years ago I met Falk

21
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.190 
and that's where the connection
comes from and still remains and

22
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.080 
that's also the reason why I'm
here today. Maybe, since we

23
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.760 
want to talk about processes
and practices today in regard

24
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.700 
to design thinking, human
centered design,

25
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.100 
I would like to start with a
question that this may be a bit

26
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.550 
provocative but some of our
listeners are definitely curious

27
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.010 
about to hear it. If you
talk to practitioners there's

28
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
always these two beliefs that you
can see human-centered design

29
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.210 
either as a process
and a set of tools, or

30
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.730 
some others argue,

31
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.510 
no this can only be a mindset.
So it needs to be a philosophy,

32
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.920 
it needs to be
a culture.

33
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.630 
And before we take into the real
process topic, what is your

34
00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.190 
opinion on that? So is there a black
white or what is the landscape looking?

35
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.750 
So I do have a strong opinion
and that and I don't think

36
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's black and white and I think
it's all those things that

37
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000 
you mentioned and but for me there
is a progression. So for me,

38
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.810 
I usually show it as a pyramid. So
for me the base level design

39
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.570 
thinking and that's also often
times how you define it. It's a

40
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.010 
collection of tools, methods that
you use. You can do a journey,

41
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.360 
you can do a person like
all these things, we know

42
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.230 
kind of the base. That's the easiest
entry point, right. So just

43
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.130 
like in a regular innovation project
trader persona you're already kind of

44
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.800 
dipping your toes
into that direction and then

45
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.780 
for me the next level in the
pyramid would be processes.

46
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.380 
So processes for me help structure
all those activities, all

47
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.800 
those tools, right. So they provide a
cognitive framework on how all

48
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.400 
these things fit together because
sometimes otherwise it's

49
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.500 
quite overwhelming, right.
So you have a complex problem,

50
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.910 
you have lots of tools but
like where's the plan and

51
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.970 
on how to apply this. And processes
for me, there's two

52
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.330 
different forms. So there's the
explicit ones, let's just google

53
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.380 
the HPI process, Stanford process. There's many
many visualizations out the different models.

54
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.840 
That's an explicit one that
you can just look up somewhere.

55
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.070 
But I think if you do this long enough
you will also have an implicit one.

56
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.900 
You will have your own personal
way to problem solve and if

57
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.650 
you work in a company long enough you
have, will have an impressive process

58
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.870 
of how you do it and then the process
will actually like applying,

59
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.430 
the process will help you learn
about the principles. It's

60
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.360 
iterative, it's prototyping driven,
it's collaborative. So all

61
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.150 
these things for me are higher
up the pyramid and then

62
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.500 
the top one is amazing and then
my background is education, right?

63
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.400 
So people say well if you want to
get there why don't we educate

64
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.110 
for that, right? So how do you educate
for a mindset? I haven't

65
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.870 
found a better way than to go
through that pyramid, right. So

66
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.150 
I start  at the bottom. So we do tools,
we do processes, we reflect

67
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.410 
on the principles and then
comes the mindset. So we

68
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.100 
teach it upwards, but I think if you
do it long enough you will apply it

69
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.370 
downward, right. So mindset first
and then which tool you used

70
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.470 
doesn't, or which process doesn't matter
so much if you have the mindset.

71
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.200 
Maybe just as a followup question on
that. How is this learning

72
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.880 
processes working? So is it just
on an individual level or do

73
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.000 
you observe the same learning
curve on an organization level

74
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.380 
as well? So for a team member as well?
What is your perspective?

75
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.130 
Both, I mean, so I first of all
the thing I have to mention

76
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.700 
is it's a longer journey. I mean if
you google design thinking,

77
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.900 
the first ten ads you will see are
probably for one or two day workshops.

78
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.480 
So that is not your education in
a learning journey of design

79
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.040 
thinking, I would say it's years,
not months, not weeks, not days

80
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.920 
and that applies to organizations as
well. So if you as an organisation

81
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.570 
think you want to do this
or you really they look to

82
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.220 
them to shift to a different
way of working and apply this

83
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.340 
and that individual learning needs
to happen but then, you know,

84
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.210 
teams need to figure
out how to do this,

85
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.980 
whole departments need to figure out
how that ties into the other

86
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.810 
work they still need to do, like
not replacing if it's already

87
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.250 
an innovation department you're
not replacing what they do

88
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.160 
with design thinking,
you're adding on to it.

89
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.050 
Figuring all this out is a very
very long journey, it's worth it

90
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.790 
for sure, but it's long and I think that's
also where some of the misconceptions

91
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.470 
come from. So if you're in a two
day workshop and you think

92
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.500 
that's design thinking then
you will run these I think in

93
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.650 
your organization as two day
workshops and you will miserably

94
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.670 
fail, I mean, so for
example,

95
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.310 
a paper prototype. You know,
that's a good start for

96
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.790 
prototyping but that's not an an
actual prototype you can really get

97
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.440 
valuable feedback on. You need actual
skills for that and experience

98
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.710 
to do this that takes time to
develop those competencies and then

99
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.450 
don't frame it to too narrowly if you
try to implement it in an organization.

100
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.160 
Maybe I have another
provocative question. Yup.

101
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.780 
There is there is some debate
around whether companies should have

102
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.740 
but it's more important to have the
design thinking mindset instead of

103
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.570 
using it as a tool box or
using as structured process.

104
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.460 
Do you think that it's necessary to have,
it's necessary to have the mindset

105
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.330 
of design thinking to perform
it well or in some cases it's

106
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.770 
ok to use it as a process
or as a tool box.

107
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.880 
Even with a tool preferably
mindset, but I mean,

108
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.820 
I would go in that progression,
right? Start implementing tools,

109
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.150 
but learn to do it well. Move
on to processes, principles

110
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.570 
in good amounts but even with
a tool, I mean, a boring

111
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.070 
analogy of, Falk, of a
mutual friend of ours. But

112
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.670 
so we have, just behind me in the
office, we have a small workshop where

113
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.210 
we prototype actually, I mean we
build things. If it's, even if

114
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.040 
it's usually a digital product it
will interact with the physical

115
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.770 
space somehow, so we try to prototype this.
So you can go into the workshop and

116
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.450 
the analogy issue in a
two day design-thinking

117
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.460 
workshop, I can teach
you a couple of tools.

118
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.020 
Right, so you can and then you go
to the workshops that supply them

119
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.580 
the same way I would build a chair.
So maybe after two days of

120
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.890 
design-thinking training
you can use the tools.

121
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.650 
I mean, I can build something
that resembles a chair. People

122
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.870 
looking will say, well, that's a chair. I can
apply design thinking tools, so people say

123
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.510 
this might be design-thinking.
Will people be willing to sit

124
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.340 
on this after two days of training? I
don't know. It takes a long time

125
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.940 
to build something where people
comfortably sit on this, on

126
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.890 
the chair. So the thing where you train
design thinking it will take you even longer

127
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.420 
to bring it to a level where
people would pay for that chair,

128
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.460 
where there is
an actual,

129
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.040 
as a consultancy, product you
would sell or in an organization

130
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.760 
a method that competes with
methodologies and methods that

131
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.580 
have been around for
a very long time.

132
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.530 
So yes try to get to that mindset
but, I mean, you can start

133
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.620 
with the tools but even there
like applying a persona

134
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.480 
once doesn't make you a very
good creator of personas. That

135
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.800 
makes you, you know, like a
beginner and it's good that we

136
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.310 
all started somewhere but don't
think that after you do it

137
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.870 
once you're good
enough to

138
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.910 
call this, you
know to stop there,

139
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.270 
stop your process there. That brings
me up to another follow up question and

140
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:59.610 
if I get you right, then your
argument is, it seems to be a discipline.

141
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:07.070 
Something that you might
be able to to understand in

142
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.050 
a short workshop format but
in order enact, in order to

143
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:18.020 
use it as a professional
it requires a lot of more time

144
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.110 
to be in the field, to enact.
So what does it imply to you

145
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.670 
when it comes to large organisations,
I mean, they are all in a hurry.

146
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.640 
Sometimes I personally have this
feeling that we are living in this

147
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.920 
culture where everything that takes
longer than ten seconds

148
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.520 
is already too much effort and
people argue that you don't

149
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:48.380 
have time or we don't have time to do it. So
is that contradicting and being problematic

150
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.440 
to such an extent or what
is your thought about it and

151
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.290 
maybe you can even share positive or
negative examples?

152
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.980 
So, for me

153
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.820 
part of the disease is also
marketing problem on the side of

154
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.980 
design-thinking as a term, as
a methodology, as a label.

155
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.190 
So, I mean,

156
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.920 
If I sign my son up for
football classes, soccer classes,

157
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:26.440 
and you know we can go home where we can
watch premier league Bundesliga

158
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:34.810 
and I obviously see the gap in skills,
in professionalism, I obviously see that.

159
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.270 
Nonetheless, I can start with my
journey on which is football.

160
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.210 
Learn the dribbles, learn to pass,
let's have fun with it.

161
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.320 
Design thinking is the same way but
there's a misconception to me that

162
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.860 
I mean that you know
that the initial, kind of you

163
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.520 
know, going to one training camp
gets you to where you need to

164
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.000 
be to do this successfully. So
that there is a marketing

165
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.940 
problem, so if you employ them
in organizations,

166
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.010 
the first realization you
need to have is, as I

167
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:07.410 
said, it's a long run and this will take
time. So you need commitment not just for,

168
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.690 
you know, that send two or three of
our people to like a two day

169
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.870 
design-thinking workshop where they
become ambassadors for the methodology

170
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:22.030 
but it takes time, it
takes conscious effort, it will

171
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.260 
probably clash a lot of things
in your organization. You're

172
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.590 
already likely building products
already doing things that you

173
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.870 
know where design thinking
can add on to it, can maybe

174
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:38.430 
replace a few things, can
extend and the ways to work.

175
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:44.630 
So, I mean, you first figure out that
you're in it for the long run.

176
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.320 
I mean, that's that the main
issue for me and then

177
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.950 
I think that adjust expectations.
Then if you have that, if you

178
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.340 
frame it like that then you know that
you know that the first training

179
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.740 
you do, the first internal workshops
you run with this, that they are

180
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.620 
the beginnings of something that
can really help you in the

181
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.310 
future and really work for you. But
you're just starting out and

182
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.230 
you need to frame that
that right. Sometimes

183
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.290 
there's also a debate that should you
need external help, like every

184
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:23.910 
football team has as a coach,
has older players as mentors

185
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.180 
that help you, so do
you need this or not.

186
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:33.350 
Personal opinion is I think
companies over rely on this, so

187
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.340 
it helps to get started, it helps
to bring someone with more experience,

188
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.160 
but that usually also creates a
culture where people then rely

189
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.610 
on these mentors. But it's not
about I will develop the skills

190
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.850 
up to a level where I can run on my
own, but you rely on hey, this is

191
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.110 
something that's facilitated by
someone externally and that

192
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.310 
will not be sustainable in the
long run in an organization.

193
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.190 
Okay I think there is only one
question we have in mind left.

194
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.060 
Our participants and
listeners have many more but

195
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.940 
we've a bit of time constraint as
well. So in an ideal world

196
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.490 
how would an ideal implementation
of design thinking be like?

197
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:23.080 
So just as a
summary what would you think?

198
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:31.260 
I never include
the ideal world scenario

199
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.270 
questions in user
research.

200
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:41.030 
So I always have
problems with the ideal world scenario.

201
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.820 
You forget the
roots of where you come from

202
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.340 
and for me it's how does
the world version

203
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.080 
one hundred twenty point one look
like in a year or two

204
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.020 
coming from where we are. So I
hope in the future what will

205
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:02.190 
happen and I see this because I'm
still involved in universities

206
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.130 
and teaching whenever I can, I see that
the next generations, so

207
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.590 
we go into a company and I tell them
what we do and what design-thinking

208
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.360 
is and it's this it's
very different to,

209
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.040 
sometimes, to what they're used to
etc., and going to a classroom a

210
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.540 
teacher to twenty year
olds they say sure.

211
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.080 
That's the way we like to work.
Why should we do it any differently?

212
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.640 
And I think the openness towards
listening to younger people

213
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.860 
if they are in organizations as well
kind of has increased also, so I

214
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.720 
think this has become and
is becoming just

215
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.410 
the way we do things and I hope we
don't really have to talk about it

216
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.150 
in the future because the
generations that are coming after

217
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.350 
that you listen to more and
more in a couple of years

218
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:55.690 
existing more senior
stakeholders in organizations

219
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.710 
that they're also listening and
listening to the people, the

220
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.220 
next generations
that are coming up.

221
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.860 
Maybe it's something we don't
have to talk about anymore

222
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.570 
in the future and we don't need
classes and courses to kind

223
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.760 
of set the basics but we can
that's just the way we work

224
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.940 
and talk about it on
a very different level.

225
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:22.110 
So that is a great thing Florian
and I would say we stay here with that.

226
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:28.870 
And thank you again Florian, your work

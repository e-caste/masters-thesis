00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.710 
Hi, my name is Paula and I'm a member
of the Sustainability Club at HPI.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.020 
We are interested in how we can contribute to
making digital technologies more sustainable.

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.820 
Digital technology has taken
over large parts of our lives

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.610 
and as we are also facing a global
climate crisis, everybody

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.940 
should ask themselves how they can have a
positive impact on their energy usage.

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.270 
Digitalisation can help conserving energy
and to limit resource consumption,

7
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.590 
but it also accounts for a significant
share of global greenhouse gas emissions.

8
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.420 
Many emissions are produced, for example, in
the manufacturing of electronic devices,

9
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.110 
the usage of devices in our own
households, the transmission

10
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.850 
of data via the internet, and
the operation of data centres

11
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.310 
without which Google, Spotify
and co. could not function.

12
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.090 
In all of those areas, there are things
that we can all pay attention to.

13
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.090 
Let's start with
manufacturing.

14
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.340 
When buying new technological products
one can consider several factors,

15
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.900 
the easiest one is of course to
use devices longer so you don't

16
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.900 
have to buy new products
in the first place.

17
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.320 
This is not just sustainable
it also saves money.

18
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.090 
Something that could help with that is
to invest in long-lasting products.

19
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.910 
When buying a product look out
for possibilities to repair

20
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.570 
the device or replace
only parts of it.

21
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.020 
You should also make sure to buy
high-quality products that

22
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.110 
will be supported with software
updates for a long time.

23
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
A third factor to consider is the
manufacturer's energy consumption,

24
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.910 
many companies provide information
about their energy sources

25
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.390 
and carbon footprint. The term
embodied energy describes the

26
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.760 
energy which is required
to produce goods.

27
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.390 
For modern technical devices
such as smartphones

28
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.190 
this embodied energy often exceeds
the energy consumption of

29
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.530 
the products during their lifespan.
So, it's worth looking for

30
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.740 
long-lasting and
repairable products.

31
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.220 
After buying a new product of
course we want to use it,

32
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.190 
another part of emissions originates
from our daily usage of

33
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.090 
digital technologies
and products.

34
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.090 
In Germany, about a quarter of the energy
consumption is caused in private households.

35
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.210 
You can help by reducing your own
energy consumption and power bill

36
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.420 
by following a few simple and
probably often heard tips like

37
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.290 
unplugging and turning off devices
when you are not using them.

38
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.670 
Switching to energy-saving devices
whenever you need to replace

39
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.290 
household items will
save energy as well.

40
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.710 
Modern computers and monitors do not
require a screen saver anymore

41
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.010 
they just consume more
energy that way.

42
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.870 
You can also set an example with the
choice of your electricity contract.

43
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.240 
The best way to find out more about this
is to visit the website of your federal

44
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.500 
environmental agency.

45
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.060 
Nowadays we all spend a lot of time
on the internet which produces

46
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.310 
a lot of data traffic, let's take a
look at how this affects emissions.

47
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.980 
The internet is
responsible for3.5% of

48
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.970 
global CO2 emissions, video
streaming accounts for over two

49
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.380 
thirds of those
emissions.

50
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.730 
There are a few quite obvious ways
to reduce your personal energy

51
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.530 
consumption when
using the internet.

52
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.140 
Of course, streaming less altogether
saves energy. If you need

53
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.010 
to access a file or a song often
download the file once instead

54
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.170 
of streaming it over
and over again.

55
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.980 
Activating autoplay on platforms
like Netflix or Youtube can

56
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.700 
not only help to limit your
streaming volume but will probably

57
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.420 
also save you a
lot of time.

58
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.070 
Streaming over Wi-Fi rather than
using mobile data can also

59
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.230 
decrease the energy needed for data
transmission as the wireless signal

60
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.380 
needs to travel a
shorter distance.

61
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.620 
As videos make up about 80% of
the data that are streamed,

62
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.430 
streaming music and other audio files without
the corresponding video make sense.

63
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.940 
So instead of streaming a music
video, you could just listen

64
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.400 
to the audio
on its own.

65
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.080 
Most platforms also let you adjust the
quality of content you're streaming,

66
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.630 
when you are watching a tv series
on your phone maybe consider

67
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.720 
if you really need to stream
the video in 4K quality,

68
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.590 
this can reduce your data rate
by more than ten times.

69
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.230 
For your free time, it's also
worth considering picking up a

70
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.840 
good book more often instead of
watching Netflix or Youtube.

71
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.470 
Right now we're probably all spending
a lot of time in video conferences.

72
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.550 
An experiment by Green Spector
showed that a conference on mobile

73
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.830 
is three times more harmful to the
environment when we add a video to audio.

74
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.160 
We conducted our own small
experiment with laptops and zoom

75
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.830 
and reduced our data rate by the factor
of twenty when turning off our videos.

76
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.930 
So, maybe in the next conference
call try turning off your video

77
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.750 
whenever it's not
really necessary.

78
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.260 
Generally avoiding unnecessary
data is a good call.

79
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.080 
Everything you access on internet
like that newsletter you

80
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.880 
only open to mark it as
read consumes energy.

81
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.280 
So, feel free to unsubscribe from
newsletters and advertisement

82
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.390 
mails like that.

83
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.650 
Most services we use on the
internet have to be provided by

84
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.410 
a company in some way hence it's
worth to take a look at the

85
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.800 
large data centres
used for this task.

86
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.240 
Whenever we access data online that data
has to be stored on a server elsewhere,

87
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.460 
the service has to be running
constantly so that the data

88
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.360 
can be accessed at all times. You surely
can imagine that big companies need a

89
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.730 
lot of servers to save
all their data.

90
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.990 
They are using big data centres
that require a lot of energy

91
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.920 
to keep the
computers running.

92
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.120 
In the last years, this energy
consumption has become more important

93
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.200 
to the public image
of these companies.

94
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.900 
However, many data centres still haven't
switched to renewable energy sources

95
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.170 
or are only just now in
the process of doing so.

96
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.880 
We looked up which energy
sources some of the biggest

97
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.360 
companies are relying on. Some of
them like Google or Netflix are

98
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.820 
already compensating their energy
usage to reach carbon neutrality.

99
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.830 
Amazon and Google are also aiming to
stop producing emissions by 2030

100
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.980 
and 2040.

101
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.830 
Companies like Ecosia show that
decreasing your CO2 balance

102
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.750 
even below net-zero is possible. The
eco-friendly Google alternative

103
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.320 
already has a negative
CO2 balance.

104
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.630 
So, the easiest thing for you to do is to switch
to an eco-friendly alternative like Ecosia,

105
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.190 
and to stay on the look-out for
alternative services and settings

106
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.330 
that you can adapt to make the services you
are already using less energy-consuming.

107
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:17.080 
Also, keep in mind that everything you store
in a cloud is actively consuming energy

108
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.990 
because it needs to be kept available.
So, not uploading everything

109
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.320 
to clouds and rather
storing it locally

110
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.390 
can not only increase privacy
for you but also save energy.

111
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.270 
So, try to use some of those
tips in your daily lives.

112
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.980 
Let your friends know about this
video and stay tuned for other

113
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.360 
videos in this MOOC.

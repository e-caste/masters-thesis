00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:09.850 
Hi Tom! - Hey! - Thank you so much

2
00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:11.440 
for taking the time to talk to us.

3
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:12.990 
So our goal in this

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:16.840 
research is to learn about how people go about

5
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:18.410 
planning their trips.

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:20.330 
And it's really great that you accepted

7
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:21.200 
to talk to us

8
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.290 
because I've learned that you traveled a lot,

9
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:26.080 
and you're very interested in traveling. - Yes, that’s right.

10
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:30.000 
- So this interview won't take longer than ten minutes,

11
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:30.890 
is that okay with you?

12
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:31.560 
- Yeah, sure.

13
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:32.350 
- Alright.

14
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:34.300 
So if you don't have any questions for me,

15
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.100 
I would like to start with the interview questions.

16
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:38.190 
- I don't have any. - Okay, great.

17
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:40.130 
So tell me about your last trip,

18
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:40.850 
where did you go?

19
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:44.470 
- Well, my last big trip was to the Philippines

20
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:45.930 
in the beginning of this year,

21
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:48.100 
for seven weeks with a couple of friends.

22
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.490 
- Wow, seven weeks,

23
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:51.210 
that's a very long time.

24
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:52.640 
How did you plan the whole trip?

25
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:54.830 
- Well, you know,

26
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:56.790 
I was with a group of friends

27
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.680 
and we, we have a mutual friend from the Philippines.

28
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:02.830 
And she actually recommended to go to the Philippines

29
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:05.270 
as a worthwhile travel destination.

30
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.710 
And yeah, before we started planning ourselves

31
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.340 
she invited us for dinner.

32
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:13.090 
And, yeah,

33
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:15.550 
she would just tell us about spots

34
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:18.050 
that she really likes, about different regions

35
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:20.840 
in the country that we should go and visit.

36
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.040 
And actually before we went to the dinner

37
00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.590 
I bought a big map of the Philippines and I brought it,

38
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.660 
and we put it on the table.

39
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.450 
And we were just circling everything that she recommended,

40
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.150 
just adding notes on the map,

41
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:38.160 
and we were also, like, drawing different connections,

42
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:38.930 
when she said

43
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.860 
„yeah, should take a plane from there to there“,

44
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:43.360 
or „you should take a bus“

45
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:45.270 
or „you shouldn't take a bus in that region“,

46
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.160 
we would all put it in our map.

47
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:49.590 
So we would, yeah, we would get an overview.

48
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:55.180 
And it was really, really nice to hear her opinion on the different sights.

49
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.790 
- Wow. And you were four people,

50
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.630 
how did you come to a consensus where to go?

51
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:02.450 
How did you decide what to visit?

52
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:06.890 
- Yeah, that was actually not… not the easiest part

53
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:07.940 
to come to a conclusion.

54
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.330 
- How come?

55
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:14.330 
- Well, I think one big thing

56
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.800 
was that I had more time than they did

57
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.920 
and they wanted to be a little bit more precise

58
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:21.470 
in their planning.

59
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:24.280 
For me with the longer period of traveling,

60
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:25.690 
it wasn't that important.

61
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.250 
And, you know,

62
00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:32.340 
we all did our individual research and we came together

63
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.370 
every once in a while to to try to get it synched.

64
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:38.090 
And we had some idea,

65
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.000 
like, yeah, like the

66
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.630 
idea always was maybe we should start at the beach

67
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:45.670 
for the New Year’s. We actually left

68
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:47.470 
December 28th I think,

69
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.170 
and we wanted to be there,

70
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:53.830 
as, like, opposed to the German winter.

71
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:57.930 
And then we knew that we wanted to go to a mountain region,

72
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:00.900 
a mountain province where we wanted to spend some time.

73
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.430 
And that maybe we wanted to go back to the beach

74
00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:08.620 
to finish off the trip before they go back into the cold.

75
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.870 
Yeah, so that was like the frame

76
00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:13.950 
we kind of had,

77
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:15.100 
we kind of had,

78
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.460 
but, as I said,

79
00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:19.080 
the others really wanted to be very precise

80
00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:20.010 
on what to do.

81
00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:21.580 
But then I couldn't really

82
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.520 
agree on their very tight schedule.

83
00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:28.450 
- So what I'm hearing is that you had an idea,

84
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.540 
all of you, about the highlights of the trip,

85
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.590 
and then you planned around it, right?

86
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.890 
- Exactly , yeah.

87
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:36.640 
- And how did your friends feel,

88
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:38.080 
how did you go about,

89
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.930 
because you were there longer than your friends,

90
00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:44.510 
and they wanted to be more precise with your planning.

91
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.240 
So how did you make it work?

92
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:50.650 
- Well, I tried to be…

93
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.040 
Well, I tried to - to give them the lead in this first part

94
00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:55.990 
and really said „Guys,

95
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:57.520 
if you wanna be that precise -

96
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.610 
I don't want to, want to stop you from doing that.

97
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:02.310 
So really just

98
00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:04.640 
go ahead, make your plans and

99
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:07.270 
I try to be with you as much as possible.“

100
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:10.890 
But also told them that I won't jump on five,

101
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:12.920 
six different islands within three weeks,

102
00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:14.730 
because I will go there later,

103
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:15.810 
or I don't go there at all.

104
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:17.880 
So I really tried

105
00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:22.060 
to let them decide

106
00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:26.380 
and then plan according to their plans, you know?

107
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.390 
- I see. And when you're not in such a big group,

108
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.330 
how do you plan your trips?

109
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:38.010 
- Well, I usually travel with friends

110
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:40.190 
like with, like, one other person.

111
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:44.840 
And I also really like to take the lead in planning.

112
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:46.600 
I always like to know the,

113
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:49.750 
you know, the general regions.

114
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:54.300 
I wanna be informed myself before I go to a country.

115
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.430 
So that's the starting point.

116
00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:57.640 


117
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:59.210 
I wanna set a frame

118
00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.280 
but want to be flexible within that frame

119
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:07.020 
that I think of. You know, I would sketch out

120
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:09.290 
possible routes that I could take.

121
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.540 
But, but really try to have like,

122
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:14.340 
days in between or see it more as building blocks

123
00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:15.500 
that I could move around,

124
00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:17.330 
yeah,

125
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:21.090 
depending on what I learn in the country when I'm there.

126
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:25.880 
- So, you said that you kind of inform yourself

127
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:28.620 
upfront about different regions,

128
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:29.380 
you have an idea

129
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:31.190 
of what you want to see,

130
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:32.970 
how the frame looks like. How do you get this information,

131
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:35.520 
how do you inform yourself about different regions

132
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:37.120 
of a new country that you're visiting?

133
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:37.770 
Yeah,

134
00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:43.490 
well, actually I start with classic guidebooks,

135
00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:45.440 
like travel guides, like,

136
00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:46.850 
I don’t know, the Lonely Planet -

137
00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:49.180 
I usually don't have that, but the German version of it.

138
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:57.040 
And, well I actually I buy two books.

139
00:05:57.451 --> 00:05:57.740 
- How come?

140
00:05:57.881 --> 00:06:01.540 
- So, there's the - usually I buy a small travel guide,

141
00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:04.850 
which is only like sixty, seventy pages,

142
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.380 
because it gives me a very nice overview of it.

143
00:06:07.591 --> 00:06:09.240 
It really doesn’t go into detail

144
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:11.600 
and I don't have to go through

145
00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:14.420 
fifty, sixty pages to come to the next region,

146
00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:15.540 
it's very cool.

147
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.600 
And the brand that

148
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:18.830 
I usually buy, it also comes with a map.

149
00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:21.240 
So I always have the -

150
00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:24.430 
it's also a folded map that I can use.

151
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:28.810 
And it helps me to get the first overview

152
00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:30.950 
and then with the other book,

153
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:33.280 
it's more detailed. It gives you a lot more information

154
00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:37.660 
about different accommodations, about bus connections.

155
00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:39.100 
But that's not interesting

156
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:41.330 
while I'm still at home,

157
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.150 
you know, I will take more -

158
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.620 
I usually look at this book

159
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:48.130 
a lot more during my travels than before.

160
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:53.820 
- I see. I'm curious to understand

161
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:57.120 
how you make decisions about where you want to visit.

162
00:06:57.541 --> 00:06:59.290 
You talked about this

163
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:01.220 
friend that you had, from the Philippines,

164
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:02.110 
who you met

165
00:07:02.111 --> 00:07:04.200 
and then you decided to go to the Philippines.

166
00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:06.440 
So I'm curious to hear how you make these

167
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:08.070 
decisions around traveling.

168
00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.930 
- Yeah, well, as you said

169
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.070 
the Philippines trip started with the personal recommendation

170
00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:16.500 
of a friend who was actually from the country.

171
00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:19.680 
And that's how I chose,

172
00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:20.570 
yeah,

173
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:22.700 
a couple of my last travel destinations.

174
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:26.570 
So I went, the year before,

175
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.160 
I went to Iran because I met a lot of nice people from there.

176
00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:30.150 
And they told me,

177
00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:31.630 
yeah, just check it out

178
00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:33.240 
it's very, it's very nice.

179
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:33.390 
I…

180
00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:36.160 
I also knew that some friends were traveling there,

181
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:39.530 
and yeah, that was a reason to go there.

182
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:41.190 
Then I went to Italy because I met a lot of Italians

183
00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:42.650 
because I met a lot of Italians

184
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.640 
the last years as well

185
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:44.420 
and they also said

186
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:47.050 
„Hey, you should check out our home country.“

187
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:53.080 
And I was curious to see my friends’ home countries.

188
00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:56.470 
And, you know, but also other friends would say

189
00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:00.650 
„Yeah, we’re going to Norway this year,

190
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:02.210 
why don't you just join in?“

191
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:04.050 
And I would also go with them,

192
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:06.890 
because it’s just worthwhile to spend time with your friends anyway.

193
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:10.880 
- Thank you so much, Tom,

194
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:13.410 
it has been very interesting to talk to you.

195
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:15.750 
- Yeah, you're welcome, thank you.

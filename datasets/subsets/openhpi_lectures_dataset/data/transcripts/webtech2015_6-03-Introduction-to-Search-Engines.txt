00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.090 
Let's take a closer look to very important web application. Let's speak about search engines.

2
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.900 
The question is, in the world wide web there is a huge amount of information,

3
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.490 
huge amount of information of documents, of text, of video, of audio data

4
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.180 
and if a user is interested in some special information, the

5
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.920 
question is how he can find a needle in the haystack.

6
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.710 
Until 2008 Google was reporting

7
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.710 
the number of document

8
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.350 
it had found in the World Wide Web so he found the documents by following

9
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.210 
URLs, by following links in the documents that were already found.

10
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.240 
And what they reported was that they found a trillion

11
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.490 
documents in the web and this was 2008.

12
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.380 
In the meantime google is not no more reporting this number.

13
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.030 
It becomes huger and huger and

14
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.290 
it is nearly impossible to estimate the current number of documents

15
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.010 
everyone, ever user

16
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
who can access to the web can set up a server and can put documents on the server.

17
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.320 
And can enlarge the huge number of data that are available over the web.

18
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.440 
So the document collection in the web this is an estimation

19
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.860 
it doubles approximately every six months.

20
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.180 
So we have an exponential increase and you can

21
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.340 
start to compute from that time from 2008 doubling

22
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
twice a year. So it's unimaginable.

23
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.290 
So it is not very likely that this strength of

24
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.240 
accessing, of providing more and more information over the web

25
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.280 
is coming to an end. So also for the next years we have to expect

26
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.260 
such a doubling in the number of documents that are available in the web.

27
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.580 
So the search engines that should be able to find relevant information

28
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.590 
have to fulfill more and more hard job.

29
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.620 
There are many different types of search engines and there are different search engines

30
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.700 
on the market. In most case they are free if they can be used free of charge

31
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.320 
and we will see that they follow different functional principles.

32
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.990 
But here is only a few of the more popular search machines

33
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.630 
that users can use to search in the web and to find needle in

34
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.760 
the haystack.

35
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.700 
Search service as I

36
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.410 
mentioned, this helps the user to search documents in the web.

37
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.890 
To find what they are looking for. So search services should

38
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.850 
fulfill the following requirements - they should support the users

39
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.210 
in information retrieval. Information retrieval that's the name to

40
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.480 
get information out of the web.

41
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.120 
It should be, they should

42
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.110 
select the data, provide the data for the user from a very extensive collection

43
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.810 
of web documents, ideally this collection should include all

44
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.310 
documents of the web but we saw already that this is impossible.

45
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.820 
But at least they should be able to have

46
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.120 
to search in an extensive collection of web documents.

47
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.190 
To be able to do this, they have to analyze the different documents in the web

48
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.320 
and they have to assign specific key terms

49
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.110 
to a website and then if a user comes with the search query with a

50
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.720 
keyword, they select collected data

51
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.590 
to find all those document where these key terms are connected

52
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.520 
to the match, the

53
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.050 
wishes, the query of the user.

54
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.570 
So speedily they find every information.

55
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.550 
So it should be possible. Also, they find new information

56
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.580 
because the web is living, every time new documents come into

57
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.760 
the web or published in the web. So if a user is searching for

58
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.050 
any kind of information,

59
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.140 
he will also be able to find very new information.

60
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.460 
So the search service not only have to search

61
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.410 
and possibly a big part of the web to analyze all the pages but

62
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.620 
search machine have to do this periodical, to be also able to find

63
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.350 
information that was newly published in the web.

64
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.220 
So the most important criteria to evaluate a search service

65
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.640 
for a user are the user wants to

66
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.300 
have a high recall, that means the collection should be

67
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.100 
as complete as possible, the collection of document that the search engine

68
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.680 
has analyzed and the search machine is able to provide.

69
00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.650 
So user ones that it is possible to find all relevant documents to

70
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.930 
his or her query.

71
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.300 
The criteria for evaluating search services is that the

72
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.060 
results, the search results are accurate.

73
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
That the search machine works with a high precision. That means that they

74
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.980 
find only those documents which are relevant for the

75
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.540 
query of the user.

76
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.950 
I already mentioned that there are very different types of search engine.

77
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.530 
Different functional principles the search machines are based on.

78
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.270 
So there is a group of search machines

79
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.150 
which are called, which are comparable which are web catalogs.

80
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.060 
That means there is a catalogue and the catalogue is on the

81
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.090 
basis. So, the documents of the web are

82
00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:00.390 
taken out of the web. There are human editors, they check and evaluate the

83
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.210 
document and they put it in a certain place in as a catalogue which is

84
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.850 
on the basis of a search engine.

85
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.080 
Then the user can browse in the different categories that are

86
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.500 
provided by the catalogs.

87
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:24.080 
So here is also the example for that for such web catalogues.

88
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.320 
Most important types of search engines are so called index

89
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.950 
based search engines. Google for example is such an index based

90
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.620 
search engine or Bing.

91
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:44.150 
Here automated agents, so called crawlers they visit the web,

92
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:51.180 
they walk through the web, they collect web documents and then automatically

93
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.320 
the document is analyzed, it is indexed and then

94
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.770 
on the basis of this index, the user queries are answered.

95
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.960 
Compared to the web catalogs, which needs human editors here

96
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.280 
with the index based search engines we have automated agents.

97
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.390 
Another type of search engines are so called meta search engines.

98
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:26.180 
The meta search engines, they start other search engines to find

99
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.340 
answer to the query. So, they are based on the result of a different

100
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.550 
search engine and then they recombine the results, the top results provided by

101
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.170 
the other search engines. So the different meta search engines

102
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.920 
they are based on different types and different other

103
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.230 
search engines.

104
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.170 
Then we have the paid placement search engines.

105
00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.560 
This is important in the commercial area for marketplaces and others.

106
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.830 
And here information is provided by the search machine

107
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:12.950 
which were paid by the information provider. So the more

108
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.170 
the information provider is paying,

109
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.830 
the more often his document are

110
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.840 
shown in the results of a search machine are shown to the user.

111
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.710 
Paid placement of the search results

112
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.090 
when a user asks the search engine a query and the query provides this result.

113
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:44.010 
Then there is an a huge amount of topic oriented search engine.

114
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.410 
Of course it becomes more easy to collect data if the

115
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.100 
search machine concentrates on a certain topic.

116
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.140 
So, for example such topics are shopping. Search machines around shopping.

117
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.480 
Shopping in general or shopping for a specific

118
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.580 
type of products. News

119
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:16.410 
search machines. If users want to get informed about news there are

120
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.030 
search services or search engines that

121
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.980 
are specialized to provide such news. There are search engines

122
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.960 
that are specialized to provide information about people.

123
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.590 
There are search engines that are specialized

124
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:38.650 
to answer questions, to answer queries about computer, about internet, about

125
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.330 
IT technology. There are entertainment

126
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.680 
search engines which are specialized for example to find videos

127
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.860 
or to find songs for the user. Business related search machines,

128
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.590 
science related search machines. Here are

129
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.170 
only a few examples of such topic oriented search engines.

130
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.750 
We speak about various types of search machines. So, beside

131
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.700 
of web catalogs, the index based search machines, the prepaid,

132
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.890 
the topic oriented search machines. Of course there are also

133
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:20.980 
a number of regional search engines concentrated on finding information

134
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.560 
with a local relation with a relation to a special place

135
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:32.420 
as a user. Or there are search machines that are specialized

136
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.480 
to find a special type of information for example to find blogs or

137
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:43.340 
RSS feeds and here for example the HPI blog intelligence

138
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:49.690 
search machine, www.blogintelligence.de helps you

139
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.660 
to find to search blogs

140
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.320 
and blog posts.

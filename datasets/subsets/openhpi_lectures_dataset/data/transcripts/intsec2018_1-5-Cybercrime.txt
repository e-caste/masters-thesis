00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.300 
Let's have a closer look to
cybercrime and let's first ask the

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.470 
question what about the
evaluation of the damage

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.250 
of internet crime. First
statement it's difficult,

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.950 
it's almost impossible to quantify
the damage caused by cybercrime,

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.060 
precisely what are the reasons.
For example a very high number

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.920 
of security incidents is not
detected by the owner of

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.190 
the systems, by the provider of the
services, they are not aware that

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.460 
their data are stolen or the identities
are all stolen or in the system

9
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.440 
malware is installed

10
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.910 
to see behind, to break in,
to see behind the service

11
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.050 
to get inside into personal
data and others.

12
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.870 
Another reason is there are so
many different types of attacks

13
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.480 
that could be run in the internet,
attacks in the IT systems,

14
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.740 
attacks against the internet
connection, against the services

15
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.110 
that are run on the system, against
the databases and others.

16
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.410 
Similarly it's very difficult
to count the exact number

17
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.430 
by vulnerable systems, of
vulnerability of applications

18
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.920 
that are offered in the internet.
Such vulnerabilities provide

19
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.360 
the possibility for an attacker
to perform an attack.

20
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.180 
But some of the security gaps,
some of these vulnerabilities

21
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.050 
are known only to a
very small number

22
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.250 
of hackers or secret agents.
Thse are so called Zero-Day

23
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.290 
vulnerabilities.
These Zero Day

24
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.100 
vulnerabilities
consequently

25
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.180 
can only be abused by the small
number of hackers that know them

26
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.920 
and if the vulnerability
is publicly known

27
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.580 
then also the vendor of the
system or the provider

28
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.250 
of the service they can
design and offer updates,

29
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.150 
updates that close
this vulnerability.

30
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.110 
Question what does it mean when
we speak about vulnerability?

31
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.160 
The vulnerability of
a software system

32
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.330 
is defined for example by
the German administration

33
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.040 
for security in the
internet as a missing

34
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.480 
or inadequately implemented
safety measure

35
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.090 
for such a software system. And this
gives attackers the possibility

36
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.930 
to successfully attacks the system.
For example software error

37
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.650 
can open a security
gap can provide

38
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.210 
a way, a method that the attacker
can break into the system,

39
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.960 
can disturb the correct
work of the software,

40
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.300 
can access the data
that is processed by

41
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.600 
this software. The software
error opens a security gap

42
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.310 
or opens an attack zone in an
IT system. When we speak

43
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.900 
from exploit or exploited
then we mean software

44
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.690 
that exploits such
vulnerabilities,

45
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.550 
that exploit such security gaps
to gain access to the target

46
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.650 
system, to gain higher privilege,
to gain access to the data

47
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.640 
or other browsing. The vulnerability
is that there is something

48
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.400 
in the software that provides
the attackers the possibility

49
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.780 
to attack the system and exploit, is
the software that can be used

50
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.380 
to attack to misuse this vulnerability
and to successfully attack

51
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.220 
system. An exploit
contains malicious code -

52
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.730 
malicious code that exploited
the vulnerability in the

53
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.320 
target system and then causes the
effect that is desired by the

54
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.780 
attacker, for example
getting access to data

55
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.520 
or getting a higher
privileges or others.

56
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.550 
To understand this
in a better way

57
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.290 
let's consider an example
from the non digital life.

58
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.740 
Let's assume security personnel
in a jail will not check

59
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.730 
packages weighing less
than 500 grams.

60
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.830 
Here the missing check
is a vulnerability,

61
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.750 
a vulnerability that can
be misused. For example

62
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.230 
can be misused in the following
way. An inmate's friends

63
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.120 
sent a package with a cake and in
the cake there is a mobile phone

64
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.260 
so the package and
the mobile phone is

65
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.420 
less than five hundred
grams and in this way

66
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.760 
it is not checked by the
security personnel

67
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.370 
prepared cake which looks like a cake

68
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.450 
but inside there is a mobile
phone, this is an exploit.

69
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.350 
The exploit that means the
package under 500 grams

70
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.990 
contains the malicious
code, the malicious code

71
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.490 
is the cake with a mobile phone. If the
security personnel passes the cake

72
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.070 
to the inmate then that means
exports the malicious code

73
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
an inmate gets the mobile phone
and can do wrong things.

74
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.240 
I hope this clarifies
a little bit

75
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.650 
the notions vulnerability and
exploit here in our example

76
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.330 
this is part of the
system was manipulated by smuggling

77
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.550 
of an illegal phone so a
security incident occurred

78
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.970 
because a smartphone
can be misused for

79
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:29.650 
bad things inside the jail.
Coming back to the digital

80
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.040 
world, here vulnerabilities
often are classified.

81
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.010 
For example as an
example let's consider

82
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.220 
CVE-2010-2553

83
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.240 
vulnerability. This
is a software error

84
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.080 
in the media codec in windows XP
in windows vista and windows

85
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.640 
seven and this
mistake, this error

86
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.480 
allows a remote
code execution.

87
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.020 
This possibility that one can
misuse this codec this error

88
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.770 
in the media codec provides
of course a vulnerability

89
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.860 
that can be misused by attacker.
Now an attacker prepares a

90
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.930 
media file for example
video and sends this file

91
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.260 
or link to this file
with a video to a user.

92
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.900 
The prepared video with some
malware hidden in that

93
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:39.090 
video that provides an exploit.
Since the media codec contains

94
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.890 
this error, the
code the malware

95
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.820 
that is hidden in the
video is not detected

96
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.480 
and it's executed. The code
encoded by the attacker

97
00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:00.390 
is executed during the video
decoding, for example the code

98
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.190 
deletes victims data or
does another wrong thing.

99
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.510 
The code for deletion
or other wrong things

100
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.660 
this is the malicious
code, here the exploit

101
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.670 
is the video with the hidden
malware as a vulnerability

102
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.500 
is the error, the software
error that is inside the

103
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:29.220 
media codec. It's reality,
was a reality and this

104
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.200 
vulnerability is classified here
and in a database one can see

105
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:42.500 
exactly what is this CVE here.
This stands for common

106
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.590 
vulnerabilities
and exposure

107
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.240 
and is a database of the
known vulnerabilities.

108
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.860 
As soon as in a software
system such a vulnerability

109
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.060 
is detected, it is a
classified in the system

110
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.370 
to give the people the possibility
for example software vendors

111
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:09.520 
to design an update
to close this gap

112
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.580 
to make it impossible to
misuse this vulnerability.

113
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.460 
We have a third example,
technical example

114
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.880 
for such a vulnerability
and exploits for such.

115
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.340 
Technical example consists
in a web service

116
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.380 
that provides a contact form,
contact form where one can

117
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:39.270 
write this personal data, his wishes
for example what kind of a pizza

118
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.020 
one would like or
others. The text which

119
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.090 
has to be entered by the user that
text is stored in a database

120
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.250 
in an SQL database. The
problem is the text is

121
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.970 
undetected and
unchecked

122
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:06.090 
stored in the database. The
text, the attacker can also

123
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:12.710 
use such a contact form
to write some malware

124
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.320 
in the places and it is not
considered this malware

125
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.950 
immediately is stored in the
database. Of course this is a

126
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:28.510 
vulnerability that
can be misused by

127
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.910 
an attacker. Here is an example
how is can be misused.

128
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.560 
The programming implemented
we see SQL comment insert

129
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:46.600 
this text into the table
contact request values.

130
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.140 
Now the attacker can
write an exploit

131
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.520 
and exploit in this case because
it's an a attack against

132
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.690 
the SQL database, this is
an SQL injection exploit.

133
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:08.030 
He can write this exploit to
read the data from that database

134
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:13.390 
or even to delete this data
and here is what the

135
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.250 
attacker does, he
smuggled into the form

136
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.420 
the following text - the
text which gives the

137
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.970 
comment to delete data.

138
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.250 
So the malicious code
is drop table users

139
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:39.080 
and in the form this text is
written and hidden here

140
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.240 
by this semi
colon. Since the

141
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:49.690 
SQL, since this is an SQL command
when the data are stored in

142
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.840 
the SQL database these
commands are executed.

143
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.810 
Executed insert into a table
the contact request value

144
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:04.280 
it looks (a) and then the next
command is now drop the table

145
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.980 
users. You see the vulnerability
is that it's not

146
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.430 
checked when the data
taken from the

147
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:18.550 
contact form is stored
in the SQL database

148
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.590 
and this vulnerability can
be misused by an attacker

149
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.010 
which gives into the
contact form some malware,

150
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.310 
some code in this case
to delete user data.

151
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.530 
Of course there are different
types of such exploits.

152
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.500 
So the exploits can be classified for
example based on the vulnerability

153
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.460 
types which they
make use of.

154
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.280 
The most common vulnerability
types are buffer overflow,

155
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.530 
are SQL injection, are code
injection, are cross-site scripting,

156
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.810 
by the way later on we will
look into more details

157
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.660 
of this type of vulnerabilities,
but there is one type

158
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.970 
of vulnerability that is very
very dangerous. And these are

159
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:12.350 
the so called Zero Day exploit
and this is an exploit

160
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:17.110 
for which there are
no corresponding

161
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.080 
patches or updates available.
Typically zero day this is just

162
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:27.090 
detected or detected only by
a small group of attackers

163
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:33.890 
so as a vendor had no
chance to develop a patch

164
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.890 
which makes it impossible to
misuse this vulnerability.

165
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.620 
Zero day also often means exploits
that are based on vulnerabilities

166
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.170 
that are unknown to
the manufacturer

167
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.500 
that are unknown to the public
and these are very dangerous

168
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.910 
exploits because such type of
exploits can be used because

169
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:04.710 
there is no means known
against this. The name

170
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.780 
Zero days came from the
fact that the developers

171
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.270 
for example of the
manufacturer or

172
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.070 
the vendor had no time, zero
days to fix the security gap

173
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.620 
and to design an update.
Here are some attacks on

174
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:29.430 
IT systems making use of
exploits. There are

175
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.880 
attacks that aim to gain
access to a target system,

176
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.200 
later on to see the data are do
some wrong things in the target

177
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.480 
system. Then they want to get
these attacks by executing an

178
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.460 
exploit, for example making
use of a vulnerability

179
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.560 
the goal to interfere with
the proper function of

180
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:58.020 
of the system or even causing the
system crash or manipulating

181
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.200 
data or even deleting data
that are stored in system

182
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:15.320 
or attackers can do this by
finding for example exploits

183
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.000 
in the internet. So it's not necessarily
that the attackers writes

184
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.290 
himself such exploit,
they can find this

185
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.530 
in the internet. So there
are so-called metasploit

186
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.940 
it's a software

187
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:37.130 
for penetration testing and
in the result it provides

188
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.720 
exploits which exactly
for that system

189
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:47.760 
can be used, can be misused to
break in to steal data and do

190
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.750 
other things. When we mentioned
in the beginning that it

191
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.840 
becomes more and more easy for
the attackers to attack systems

192
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.690 
then also this is an
important fact because

193
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.750 
in the beginning of
the digital world

194
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.610 
the attacker have to develop such
exploit, they have to find the

195
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.040 
vulnerability and then they have
to design the software that

196
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.380 
misuse this vulnerability and exploit
this but meanwhile there are

197
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.000 
databases available
in the internet

198
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.260 
where attackers can take their
data from, here for example

199
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.320 
is such a link to
such an exploit

200
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.360 
database. This database
here collects exploits of

201
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:37.290 
any kind. Today it
provides more than

202
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.410 
38,000 exploits.

203
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.540 
What is a security incident?
Security incident

204
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.730 
is a successful attack
on an IT system.

205
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.290 
The reaction in large companies
against such security attacks

206
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.770 
needs to be organized
by so called security

207
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:07.560 
incident response team and this
response team has simply to

208
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.640 
follow a previously developed
reaction plan. So one has to design

209
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.360 
such an reaction plan not under
the condition of an attack, one

210
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.350 
has to do this in a quiet phase
and has to think if something

211
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.210 
happened what should we
do so that in case

212
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.580 
successful such a security
incident happened

213
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.260 
the plan can be followed. What
needs to be done, what is

214
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.750 
part of this plan, part of this
reaction plan is lock messages,

215
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.130 
fix all and store all what's
going on in the messages

216
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.490 
to provide a basis for later
analysis, investigate which systems

217
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.660 
are affected, which
files are infected,

218
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.200 
remove the affected systems
from the operation

219
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.830 
and replace with back
up systems so that

220
00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:03.320 
all the, for example malware
affected parts, are taken out,

221
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.980 
check other systems whether
they are also some

222
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.190 
thing happened in consequence of
the security incident, restore

223
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.710 
and update the affected
systems, analyze data

224
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.490 
and analyse which
data are lost

225
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:25.630 
and then report what's going on.
This is very important to learn

226
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.660 
from such a text to see what was
a failure for example in the

227
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.100 
configuration or which security
system was missing or

228
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:40.400 
is this a new type of attack
to see and to give rise

229
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.570 
to improve security of your system.
The security incident a successful

230
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.430 
attack on a system and such
security incident need to be

231
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.720 
analyzed in case the
system belongs to a

232
00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:00.170 
part of the critical infrastructure,
there are some reports

233
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.570 
there need to be done a
report in Germany into the

234
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:09.860 
BSI to help to prevent such
incidents in future.

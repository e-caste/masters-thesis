00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.190 
In our openHPI course Confidential
Communication in the Internet,

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.340 
we want to have now a closer
look to security goals.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.950 
The internet is a global network.
Everyone on the world can

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.930 
access to the internet, can use the
internet to communicate information,

5
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.840 
to receive information, to use
services from the world wide web.

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.040 
And the internet is an
open communication.

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.700 
Open means there are no secret
development materials.

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.990 
How is the internet working is publicly
known. All the internet standards

9
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.820 
can be seen by everyone. So it is completely
the construction principles, the

10
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.440 
design of the internet is open and
everyone can access and can see

11
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.510 
how this is organised, what software and
protocol are used to reach these effect.

12
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.210 
This openness was a very important,
actually key important fact

13
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.060 
that the internet became so popular
world wide in a historical short time.

14
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.710 
But the openness also allows the
attacker and cybercriminals to see

15
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.130 
how things are constructed, to find
mistakes or to find ways

16
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.600 
for their attacks.

17
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.850 
Thee people, everyone whether it's
a private person, whether it's

18
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.470 
companies, organization, everyone
can use the internet.

19
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.500 
And what he or she have to do
is to connect the own devices,

20
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.030 
it could be computers, it could
be smartphones, tablets.

21
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.940 
To connect own device by means of so
called internet service provider.

22
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.930 
So the internet service provider
they are the one that organise

23
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.150 
the connection of the different
networks, of the different

24
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.510 
customers and they connect their part
of the internet with that of another

25
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.540 
ISP provider and also mobile provider
are such ISPs because you can

26
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.720 
get access to the internet
with your smartphone.

27
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.420 
With access to the internet everyone
can request any kind of information,

28
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.980 
any kind of data from the world wide web.
You can use any kind of the services,

29
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.800 
the search services,
health information,

30
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.990 
teaching information and others.

31
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.010 
When we look to the data that are
transferred over the internet

32
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.450 
then these data are transported
over the internet in plaintext.

33
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.750 
At least as long as the sender
has not encrypted the data.

34
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.460 
So is the internet itself
the IP protocol and

35
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.360 
TCP IP protocols at all, they do not
come with encryption technology.

36
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.160 
So that everyone need to be aware
that when he or she sends

37
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.770 
information over
the internet, then

38
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.020 
the information is
in the plaintext.

39
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.210 
Nowadays there are some security
measures with TLS protocol,

40
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.970 
we will discuss this later, but
without this data are sent

41
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.610 
in plaintext and everyone who
has access to the internet, and

42
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.020 
these are so many people,
has access also to the

43
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.840 
information if no security
measures are taken.

44
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.080 
So for the safe use of the
internet, the following security

45
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.240 
objectives must
be guaranteed.

46
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.260 
It should be

47
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.650 
clear that it's not possible to
forge entity of the sender.

48
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.910 
It should be possible to
recognize whether the data

49
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.850 
I receive from the internet
are in that form

50
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.910 
or as it were sent from the sender.
That they were not

51
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.440 
manipulated on the way
of the transfer.

52
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.390 
The confidentiality should be
guaranteed for the transmitted data

53
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.310 
and it is also important that the
data I received, that they are legal

54
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.150 
and enforceable,

55
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.990 
so that later on for example
if I order something from an

56
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.340 
e-shop and they
send me something wrong

57
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.450 
that I am able even in
a court dispute,

58
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.920 
I am able to proof here
this was my order.

59
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.700 
So the identity is

60
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.360 
an important security
goal because the user should

61
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.820 
be able to confirm the identity
of the communication partner.

62
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.690 
It should be clear that the mail if
these are Alice and this is our Bob

63
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.110 
really comes from Alice as the
sender address is the address of Alice.

64
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.580 
You remember we
discussed the CEO

65
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.150 
attack and there the attacker
manipulated the identity.

66
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.970 
And so what's important to provide
software means and we can do this by

67
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.330 
cryptographic methods so
that it's not possible

68
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.410 
to forge the identity.

69
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.550 
Another important security goal is the
integrity of the received information.

70
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.550 
The information must not be
changed without authorisation.

71
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.210 
Of course one cannot prevent if
the data are sent over an open

72
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.780 
internet, everyone has access and
everyone can change. But I

73
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.880 
need to have the chance to realise
whether there was a manipulation.

74
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.280 
So if data are sent
and if the attacker

75
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.700 
makes some manipulation in

76
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.920 
the sender or in the
content of the

77
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.020 
information then Alice
should be able to recognise.

78
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.630 
They cannot prevent that but they
should be able to recognize.

79
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.020 
The security goal confidentiality is that
the information must be kept secret

80
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.330 
from unauthorised
parties.

81
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.450 
The information is sent and if its sent
in plain text its like in a postcard.

82
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.730 
Everyone who has access to the
network can see and can read

83
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.210 
and understand what is written
in this postcard, what is the

84
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.600 
content of this message.

85
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.820 
So the information before to make
it unreadable for the attacker,

86
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.670 
it is important
to encrypt.

87
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.910 
And the fourth security a goal I mentioned
was a commitment to legal binding.

88
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.540 
And here the exchange information
should be legal binding that means

89
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.220 
if there isn't a
message sent to the

90
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.430 
partner, then it should not be
possible for the partner to refuse

91
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.020 
to have received
this mail.

92
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.210 
There are of course many more
security goals but these are

93
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.160 
the security goals that play an
important role in the context of our

94
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.350 
topic - the confidential
communication via the internet.

00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.660 
hello everybody, thank you for
inviting me to speak at openHPI.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.570 
my name is Ingolf Wittmann, I'm
leading quantum system business

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.470 
unit at Fraunhofer IAF.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.480 
before that, I was developing and running c
worldwide quantum technical field team.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.540 
I think that's the reason why i
could talk quite well about

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.530 
the ibm and fraunhofer
joint quantum project.

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.260 
so my agenda for today is to give feedback about
the IBM and Fraunhofer quantum corporation

8
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.930 
and the program. what the Fraunhofer IAF
is doing regarding quantum technologies?

9
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.020 
what are the future quantum
computing technology as such?

10
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.920 
and i like to introduce hybrid
hardware architecture.

11
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.940 
and last but not least also talk a little bit
about hpc simulation and software technology

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
which are very important
in that context.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.130 
so let's first give a short introduction
about the fraunhofer IAF.

14
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.390 
the IAF was founded in

15
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.540 
1957 in Freiburg and
sitting there in a

16
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
very lovely environment. we are roughly
about two hundred eighty five employees

17
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.370 
and our major focus is

18
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.660 
about developing electronics
and optoelectronic devices

19
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.100 
and integrated circuits as well
as modules based components in

20
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.190 
the semiconductor environment. so
we are looking at the group three

21
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.510 
like aluminium gallium and indium,
but also group five with

22
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.530 
nitrogen phosphorus
arsenic and antimony.

23
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.150 
we are also looking at diamond defect
centers for quantum my nektar two

24
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.880 
and single photon resources and that
is very important for research and

25
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.710 
stuff we are doing in c
quantum environment.

26
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.470 
for that we have also a big
clean room environment roughly

27
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.460 
about a thousand square meters and
that's giving us the opportunity

28
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.060 
also to build those devices for the
industry and for research cooperation

29
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.370 
in small pieces or in a
small amount of numbers.

30
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.610 
the institute is led by professor
Oliver Ambacher and he is also

31
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.210 
and he is also a spokesman
for the quantum competence

32
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.520 
network with since he
fraunhofer environment.

33
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.060 
so let's start there was the quantum
story started with fraunhofer.

34
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.450 
and this was in twenty nineteen when
angela merkel and general matti

35
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.090 
a met and see world economic forum
in davos was answered listen

36
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.410 
just in a coffee break.

37
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.530 
those two ladies were discussing and
talking about a physical system

38
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.110 
this in Germany. and you have to
know that at that point in time

39
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.900 
only quantum assistance
were reciting in the us

40
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.770 
in or just in york town
in the research lab of

41
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.700 
the quantum
environment.

42
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.350 
so this was really a great
starting point and with that

43
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.950 
the john government
was approaching

44
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.710 
the IBM organization, but also the local
government organization how we can

45
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.150 
build set up. and set point in
time I was already in discussion

46
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.780 
with fraunhofer to participate
this in the IBM Q network.

47
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.670 
and this was really a good
starting point, because

48
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.720 
fraunhofer is having a close
industry relation connection and

49
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.600 
that's a very important part
for the IBM Q network

50
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.260 
to have industry companies within
the network learning and

51
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.800 
discussing quantum technology and
to build that further. but also

52
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.530 
fraunhofer is part of the academic
environment in germany and

53
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.800 
was having also a close
relationship to the

54
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.120 
government our organization
on state and federal level.

55
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.160 
so we signed a contract in march twenty
twenty and one of the major reason why

56
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.040 
the german

57
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.830 
government was really putting some
money on the table for that is

58
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.650 
data privacy. so that's system and
everything will reset in germany.

59
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.030 
and that all our project data and all
personal data are not leaving germany

60
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.160 
especially when we are
talking about research and

61
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.740 
the IP stuff
around that.

62
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.020 
so with that the

63
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.810 
project was started, but it takes
really a while to build up

64
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.930 
a quantum system
as such. and

65
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.520 
we are actually insee states
that all components are

66
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.010 
delivered to the

67
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.770 
IBM ending in our
compute center.

68
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.800 
because one part of the contract
was that the system has to

69
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.470 
be installed within
an ibm environment.

70
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.960 
the technical people are actually
building set up installing the system

71
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.060 
and hopefully by the middle of
December, we can run our first tests

72
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.090 
and maybe in january sciences'
system such as up and running.

73
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.750 
it's in seventy
twenty-seven

74
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.530 
cupid system with a quantum
volume of sixty four.

75
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.340 
and some of the some more technical
information around that

76
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.140 
when we are talking
about this

77
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.330 
good looking system at the end. it's a
three by three square-meter environment

78
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.700 
roughly three meters high in the
front, you have the quantum system.

79
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.210 
or secure graphics processor and in
the back the whole environment

80
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.530 
which is needed to run that as we are
talking about the vacuum problems,

81
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.060 
we are talking about linux
system to control the whole

82
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.530 
environment and to be the
interface to the internet and to

83
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.810 
the web four the users, but also
the microwave generators are part

84
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.120 
of set infrastructure
and behind.

85
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.950 
and this is a small footprint
roughly ten square meters and it's

86
00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.530 
needing about ten kilowatts of power.
so just remember so as technical

87
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:06.540 
data. we need that in a comparison what
does that mean in for an hpc system.

88
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.240 
so the fraunhofer

89
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.940 
vision mission and goals for
the quantum environment is

90
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.270 
we really like to build up a powerful
and scalable quantum processor.

91
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.740 
not the biggest and
the best one, like

92
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.590 
IBM was announcing just
a couple of weeks ago

93
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.150 
to build a one thousand
cubits system. but we

94
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.180 
are looking for a system which
is fully integrated and

95
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.310 
software environment
and to give

96
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.610 
advantages within the quantum
environment for quantum

97
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.870 
computation for
the users.

98
00:07:53.090 --> 00:08:00.060 
and our mission is the sets are
not related only to AIF. it's

99
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.050 
to the overall fraunhofer organization
to develop such type of a hardware

100
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.560 
or quantum processor, but also to
develop the software concepts and

101
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.870 
software environment
for that. and

102
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.060 
we'd like to have that in place in
the next couple of years or 2020,

103
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.060 
2023 something
around that

104
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:32.520 
to have such type of a system in
place. and when we are talking about

105
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.980 
this type of environment
and fundings. so

106
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.740 
we'll come back to that

107
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:44.100 
in a minute, why this is important and
why to be part of that game here.

108
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:53.280 
for the corporation with this IBM we
built an fraunhofer competence network.

109
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.480 
and Fraunhofer competence network
within the fraunhofer organization

110
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.890 
to cover different areas of quantum
computing. so we are not talking only about

111
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.950 
quantum computing and
quantum computers as such.

112
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.990 
we are talking about different
piece parts and with that

113
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.050 
the lead for the
overall fraunhofer

114
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:26.650 
competence network is on the
fraunhofer AIF side with professor

115
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.660 
Oliver Ambacher the
spokesman for the network.

116
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.890 
and we do have
several other

117
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.520 
institutes are
taking care about

118
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:43.740 
specific areas, for example the
AISEC, together with the SIT,

119
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.090 
talking about or taking care about
cyber security and security,

120
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.040 
not only around the quantum
environment, but also what does it

121
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.630 
mean for our
classical computing

122
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.160 
environment. the
belin center is

123
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.110 
running the environments
your environment

124
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.880 
with different backends.
we will implement

125
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.610 
recency Fraunhofer
organization.

126
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:23.350 
the IWU is taking care of our
computation for image processing.

127
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.990 
the SCAI and bond is
taking care of quantum

128
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.860 
artificial intelligence. and last
but not least very important inset

129
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.220 
top environment of especially when we
are talking about hybrid environments,

130
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:45.750 
the ITWM in Kaiserslautern is taking
care of the HPC integration and

131
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:53.450 
HPC stuff. all of this seven institutes
are building up local state based

132
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.130 
centers are competent
centers and

133
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.180 
I will talk a little bit about
what we are doing with

134
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.570 
the AIF in
Buden-Wittenberg.

135
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.920 
the major funding for the whole project
was coming out of Baden-Württemberg.

136
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.370 
the state
Baden-Württemberg

137
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.160 
was giving us the
submission and

138
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.480 
more important is the
money to build up the

139
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.340 
quantum competent center for the
Baden-Württemberg industry.

140
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.510 
we are talking about

141
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:40.500 
KMU, so in germany we say
Mittelstand. because that's

142
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.160 
a very important
part of the

143
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.580 
Baden-Württemberg
industry. and

144
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:55.900 
the overall mission as in a first step really
to introduce quantum technology to those

145
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.170 
companies to build up

146
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.120 
skills within source companies.
so we are talking about an

147
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.930 
education centre which is built in
Stuttgart and in Freiberg for that.

148
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:14.590 
and a specific programme
we will offer in 2021

149
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:21.110 
to those companies. but that's not related
only to those companies, there are also

150
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.620 
cooperation within
different universities

151
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:33.480 
and research organization likes the
project plan uk as university

152
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.430 
of stuttgart or
university of own.??

153
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:43.600 
one of the very important stuff is really
to build up our quantum systems.

154
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.900 
and see races going on who is
really building the first

155
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.570 
system which is providing quantum
advantage. so a real value

156
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:59.750 
to use in that environment for
the industry, but also for the

157
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.240 
academic environment.

158
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.600 
there are actually three major approaches
to build cubits or the smallest

159
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:15.100 
part of a quantum computer. and
I think you have felt already

160
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.590 
in previous
lectures about

161
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.390 
technology as in the quantum
environment. so I will not

162
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.710 
dig into that. the most promising
environment and where

163
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.790 
many companies are actually looking
at our transport cubits which

164
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.280 
are in a very cold environment.
so we are talking about for

165
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.900 
ten million kelvins fifty million
kelvins or something like that.

166
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.840 
and d-wave IBM google
already getting

167
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.640 
are building up systems in such
type of environments. and we

168
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.130 
are talking here really about
hundreds or thousands.

169
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.500 
d-wave  is having an

170
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.190 
system in place with

171
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.240 
more than thousand cubits which
is a very specific version of

172
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.170 
of a crying computer.

173
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.450 
the universal quantum computers
like google or ibm are building.

174
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.380 
we are talking here roughly
fifty plus cubits and

175
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.320 
there was recently an
announcement from ibm

176
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.540 
to provide quantum
systems in 2020

177
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.270 
or 2023

178
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.690 
with a thousand cubits. and that's
really a challenge because

179
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.440 
to build set and
to control that

180
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.960 
type of environment and

181
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.910 
to have a stable environment that
your calculations really can

182
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.960 
be done, but also
building applications

183
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.150 
which are using seized

184
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.040 
huge amount of cubits.

185
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.610 
the second
technology is

186
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:03.950 
are based on science. I and we are
talking here about tenths of cubits.

187
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:09.960 
and one of the leading
organizations a spin-off of the

188
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.470 
university in austria is a karate
&lt;oov&gt; who are providing ses

189
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.110 
type of systems actually
like the ibm is doing

190
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.770 
we are a cloud environment
to their users and

191
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:33.030 
also running joint research projects with industries
and the university academic environment.

192
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.390 
the problem here is

193
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.240 
that you really need

194
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:46.250 
lasers to control that environment and
to manipulate that. so it's really a

195
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.520 
bigger environment. and

196
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.550 
only because of the
nature of ion traps

197
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.770 
nearest neighbors can
talk to each other.

198
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.330 
and last but not least
a diamond cubits and

199
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:12.420 
so it might work also in a warm environment,
so in not classically cool down

200
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.130 
to four kevin or fifty
million kevin likes

201
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.140 
at the transform
cubits.

202
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.420 
but we're talking here
about first outcomes of

203
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.390 
process as

204
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.360 
one digit number of cubits and
that's the environment I found

205
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.650 
like to build up
first systems

206
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.770 
which are really
providing an

207
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.440 
advantage within the quantum
technology environment.

208
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.080 
the interesting
part here is

209
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:57.310 
that you really can run those
environments at room temperature

210
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.810 
and it's pretty stable.
but to build that

211
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:06.100 
that's really a challenge and the
idea is pretty old. so it's

212
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.810 
many years ago already

213
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.220 
there was an idea brought on the
table how you can build this

214
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.880 
dimensions in quantum
processes. so let's

215
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.410 
have a look at how this is looking
like and how diamonds can be used

216
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:33.240 
for the quantum computing environment.
it's already used in the

217
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.210 
health environment
for m r

218
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.100 
investigations in
four people. so

219
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.910 
the idea was ok, if you can use that
in that type of environment.

220
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.220 
maybe we can use that also in
the quantum environment.

221
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:56.080 
a perfect diamond is consisting
out of carbon atoms. so only

222
00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.480 
carbon atoms that would
be a perfect diamond.

223
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:06.300 
so to build cubits which are built within
this perfect environment. we are

224
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:12.390 
removing two carbon atoms and putting
only one nitrogen atom within that.

225
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:20.030 
and that's called vacancy centers.
and the cleanness of the diamond

226
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.260 
has to be lower than

227
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.470 
zero point parts in one
billion parts of a set

228
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:36.380 
carbon atom environment. theoretically
those cubits could work

229
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:42.280 
on room temperature and the
manipulation of those cubits

230
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.230 
is done via photo
electronics

231
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.360 
which are generated by optical
excitation and read out as we

232
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.350 
are electrical assistant
measurement.

233
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.380 
so this is also
one of the

234
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.200 
capabilities of the Fraunhofer
IAF to build this

235
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.530 
external electronic
environment. and besides

236
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:12.710 
the cubit technology, this is
the second most important part

237
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.640 
to build quantum
computers and

238
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.100 
if you are controlling or if you are
having capabilities and knowledge of

239
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.060 
those type of

240
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.870 
technologies. and you
really can build a

241
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.010 
quantum process and a
quantum computer as such.

242
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.320 
it's more easier and more precise to
work with low temperature also in

243
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.460 
an environment like with the
transformed cubits and that's

244
00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.760 
the reason why diamonds also are
used in a four k environment

245
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.870 
to get better manipulation
and tenting place.

246
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.980 
so the nitrogen-rich vacancies
centers are used as

247
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.370 
cubits and the electronic spring is
representing the state of secure.

248
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:10.840 
it was actually possible to build to
bit quantum registers as that means

249
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.870 
we were able
to intenser

250
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.060 
took cubits and to
manipulate those.

251
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.890 
that was presented
and proved

252
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:30.700 
by people visiting the academic environment
and we are thinking that such technology

253
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.470 
might give us also the

254
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.340 
possibility to build bigger riches
as. so really to build a processor

255
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:46.410 
for a universal quantum processor.
so this is just an idea

256
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.920 
how this can look like to
build and process about

257
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.650 
ten cubits, where everything is integrated
from the optical manipulation

258
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:02.340 
of cubits and cubits riches??? and
also to read out of secure cubits.

259
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.160 
and last idea is to scare that environment
in multiplying the processor

260
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.240 
in a system and

261
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.740 
connected to each other via
optical combination. and that's

262
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.320 
a pretty cool stuff because
when we are talking about

263
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.450 
optical environments.
so the

264
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:23.850 
error problem

265
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.940 
like the microwave technology
recency transfer among purpose

266
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.620 
and you do not have
that here. and

267
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.090 
optical environments are much
more stable regarding noise and

268
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.570 
error within a system

269
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.470 
than microwave places

270
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:50.310 
like in transform cubits. so coming
from processor space technology

271
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.850 
really to assist them and of
which a software stack and an

272
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.350 
application
environment as such.

273
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.750 
it's not just only just to build
an quantum process you really

274
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.850 
have to take care about the
whole environment and you have

275
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.530 
to build a quantum
computing eco-system.

276
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.390 
and IBM was pretty
cool and that

277
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.760 
because in announcing
2016 the first

278
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.350 
five cupid system being available
we our cloud environment

279
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.920 
to everybody as open source so
that everybody really can

280
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.770 
use and test and learn about
quantum technology, so that was

281
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.270 
really a wake-up call for the rest
of the industry, but also for the

282
00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.010 
competitor self of IBM in
such type of environment.

283
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:51.930 
within europe and germany
the raise is starting off.

284
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:56.390 
there's a lot of money on
the table to build our

285
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.460 
quantum systems like cu
a quantum flagship

286
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:05.310 
program with euro hpc and the
idea is here already to build

287
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:12.660 
two systems and then the federal government
and the state our government like

288
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:19.860 
Baden-Württemberg， Bayern and, Nordrhein-Westfalen.
there's an idea to build two to five systems. so

289
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.810 
it's not only then
about one technology.

290
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.330 
the idea is really to build up
different type of technologies.

291
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.670 
because different type of technology
will also address different

292
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:38.010 
type of solution areas
and may give users and

293
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.670 
different problem
areas really

294
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.350 
a very specific and

295
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:52.290 
very individual solution. and
this is something I think which

296
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:56.170 
might be successful in a first
step instead of really building

297
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.480 
a big universal
quantum computer,

298
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:05.100 
which is solving a lot of different
type of problems. but that will

299
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:12.950 
taking place, let's say in five to ten years.
but individuals very specific solutions

300
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.640 
will take place in the next
three to five years maybe.

301
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.920 
when we are
talking about

302
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.390 
the competition and set
environment. so QT for example

303
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.450 
in austria was building

304
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.440 
one quantum computer

305
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.070 
roughly with one hundred
seven seventy irons.

306
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:43.610 
and that was pretty new for
me, also that Fraunhofer

307
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:50.380 
was part of that project because the fraunhofer
IOF was building the optics environment

308
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:55.780 
for that type of system. the other
big project is the open super cube

309
00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.770 
which is led by Frank mol and
the Forschung Center Münich.

310
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.950 
and there's an idea in the next
two years to build a system

311
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.460 
with roughly one hundred
transport cubits,

312
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.870 
which are based on technology
out of the european union.

313
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.280 
and then we do have the

314
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:26.800 
different companies in place like
Righetti are like google like ibm

315
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.550 
who are also working
in the direction of

316
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:37.850 
transformed cubits. so it's a
really a good idea to have also

317
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.790 
one system in play at least one
system in place which is based

318
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.780 
on diamonds and that's something rare the
fraunhofer organization is looking for.

319
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.890 
the software stack is also very important
and there are different type of

320
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:58.770 
software stack. but the most public and
common one is the qiskit environment of

321
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.380 
ibm, which is open source
and is also being used

322
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:08.900 
on different type of systems.
and what we have seen also is

323
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.570 
that some companies especially
start-up companies are building up

324
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.490 
above software stack,

325
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.330 
above the operating system
of quantum computers

326
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.330 
to integrate different
type of

327
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:33.130 
software systems like Cirq or the
quantum or the cascade environment.

328
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.260 
and last but not least, very
important are applications. so it

329
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:45.010 
ways to figure out which type of problems
can be mapped to a quantum environment

330
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.510 
and we are talking here

331
00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.710 
really not about a classical
computing environment where you're

332
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.340 
starting a program
and then

333
00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.790 
loading data with
the program and

334
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.570 
giving out the
outcome of that

335
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.980 
quantum computing is really
totally different here.

336
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.740 
you're looking for
a problem. you're

337
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.660 
try to map that problem
mathematically to an

338
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.850 
quantum environment
that means

339
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.510 
we're looking to
a very specific

340
00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:28.700 
linear algebra mathematics.
and then you're

341
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.320 
translating that quantum gate
operation for example in a universal

342
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.210 
computer
environment like

343
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.310 
at google or IBM to
the system. and

344
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.210 
that is including the whole
solution space of the problem and

345
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.440 
then you will calculate down
the solution space. so

346
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.720 
you are not reading
data in that.

347
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.580 
real time processing or

348
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.350 
really data driven

349
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:06.700 
calculations, that's not possible
within the quantum environment.

350
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:13.900 
and the major goal is to build
up expertise in those four

351
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.680 
segments over the next
couple of years within the

352
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:23.140 
industry environment and building consortia
of this industry and the academic

353
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.990 
environment to develop
solution for every

354
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.620 
part based technology
system, software stack and

355
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.510 
and application.
and one of the

356
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:41.030 
big advantages of fraunhofer is really
having the reach towards the industry

357
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.070 
and being able to
integrate technology and

358
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.370 
knowledge, but
also to over

359
00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.140 
education, but also joined to a
project partnerships to the

360
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.350 
industry and to the
academic environment.

361
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:05.790 
I said look in ten years future，
but relax all ready to

362
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.460 
take advantage of quantum
technology and with that

363
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.480 
we are talking about quantum
hybrid architectures.

364
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.530 
the intermediate goals
for the industry

365
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.370 
used quantum technologies
will relate

366
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.480 
on fact. so we are talking about
classical IP environment

367
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:35.010 
this process as GPUs,
FPGAs, but also then

368
00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.410 
using neuromorphic designs
and quantum technology.

369
00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:45.450 
the left side is really von Neumann
architecture and the right side is

370
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:51.580 
not von Neumann architecture. so that means
a totally different type of programming

371
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.400 
and a totally different type of
usage of source environments.

372
00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.790 


373
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.520 
it's also
something about

374
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.940 
coming over brute force
problem solving.

375
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.610 
within those environments,
you can use

376
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.260 
iterative approaches to

377
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.970 
this intelligence
simulation

378
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:28.770 
to overcome the system's limitations
in regards to size or in

379
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.830 
our compute power.

380
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.870 
what we are also thinking
that in the first step.

381
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:43.100 
accelerators might be also very helpful
in sets that type of environment.

382
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:49.270 
id quantique ones are to bring up quantum
technologies for example into a

383
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.140 
smartphone and this is

384
00:30:54.050 --> 00:31:00.860 
a cooperation project with samsung and
they are already offering some specific

385
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:08.620 
technologies like adapter cards for ended
number generators or quantum communication.

386
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.890 
and another company like quantum
brilliance plans to build-up

387
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.870 
quantum draws and adapter cards
for the general market.

388
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.300 
so these products
are offered as

389
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.940 
black box solutions. so that no
quantum know-how is needed and

390
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:30.940 
required for their application. but it's
integrated in a classical IT environment.

391
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.460 
so coming to
the last part

392
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:39.450 
of simulation and what does it
mean in a quantum environment.

393
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:45.520 
these systems are too small really
to calculate big problems.

394
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:51.080 
but what you can do is to
use intelligent simulation

395
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:57.030 
to divide the problem in different piece
parts and then calculating that down

396
00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:02.150 
within quantum environment, but
also within HPC environment.

397
00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:06.250 
so the hpc environment is
taking care of those

398
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:12.510 
parts which are not suitable
to a quantum computer and if

399
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.440 
control computing
calculation is needed then

400
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.410 
those parts are
dispatched to an

401
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.160 
quantum system.

402
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:27.070 
what does intelligent simulation
mean? so instead of brute force

403
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.070 
where you are
calculating all

404
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.780 
possible instances within
a quantum vision and

405
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:44.490 
hpc environment. you are starting
with a couple of first simulation

406
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.670 
and then you
are using an

407
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.120 
artificial intelligence

408
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.990 
which is connected to the HPC
system via an AI database. so

409
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.950 
the outcomes of the simulations
are stored from the HPC system

410
00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.090 
within that database and
the AI systems then is

411
00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.620 
taking a look and then
proposing the next possible

412
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.100 
mice probably a simulation which
should be done by the hpc

413
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:21.800 
system. and with that, the experience
was made in several projects.

414
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.200 
you really can

415
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.530 
put down the amount
of simulation

416
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:33.960 
to one third of the total amount of simulation
in a brute force environment. so a

417
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.960 
simple example,

418
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:43.410 
this with unilever for example unilever
is a building shampoos for the

419
00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.800 
public or private
markets and

420
00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:52.260 
you always have to offer new products
and set up an environment.

421
00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:58.440 
so you have a several integrations
really to are built at shampoo

422
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.810 
and typically in the past
there was a matlab or

423
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.710 
matlab and within
the matlab

424
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:11.700 
your really try and error approach,
you try to build and new shampoo.

425
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:17.540 
what unilever was doing. so giving
all the information to the HPC

426
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.630 
systems, the hpc system was
doing the calculations.

427
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.090 
but then the outcome of the
calculation was given to the

428
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.460 
AI system. and
this that

429
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.550 
only thirty percent of the
calculation have to be done.

430
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.840 
and this was a lot of cost savings
and time savings for unilever

431
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.750 
to build up and
new schampoo.

432
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.970 
another good example is the
cover-19 problem. so

433
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.590 
when you are talking
about the virus.

434
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:54.170 
how does it affect the
human body and the

435
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.610 
big hpc system environment in
the us was used for computer

436
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.430 
simulation to
examine how

437
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.910 
different variables can interact
with the corona virus and

438
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.940 
each of the individual
variables can

439
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:14.320 
be comprised of millions or even
billions of unique pieces of data.

440
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.760 
and that case what eight thousand
compounds were calculated

441
00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.910 
in todays to identify

442
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:28.680 
seventy two molecule compounds which
might impair covir-19 to dock with

443
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:34.130 
the human cell and to infect
those. this was saving

444
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.570 
months staying in red labs with
experiments and so seventy

445
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.540 
two compounds will now be investigated
for clothes of a potential

446
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:51.950 
medical drug. and this is also a good
example how these type of environments

447
00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:57.440 
can be used. so how does this look
like? we're talking about the summit

448
00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.140 
system and us also was in the
past the biggest supercomputer

449
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.980 
on earth, the number one. and
it's still the number one when

450
00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.290 
we are talking about the specific
environment of a system.

451
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:15.410 
because it's not
consisting only about

452
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:21.510 
CPUs and GPUs.
it's having also

453
00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:27.810 
so-called neuromorphic components
the synapse chip and the IBM

454
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.820 
and q systems. the quantum system is
also connected to that environment.

455
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.720 
so when you're remembering back
to the hybrid approach where

456
00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.930 
on the left side the classical
computing environment was. and

457
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:44.130 
on the right side the neuromorphic
and quantum environment that's

458
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:48.380 
really one of the first system was.
that's the first system who is

459
00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.030 
really providing that
type of technology.

460
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.830 
so have a look on the classical
AI team. so we're talking about

461
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.210 
two hundred petaflops

462
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.670 
roughly more than nine thousand
per nine CUPs more than twenty

463
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.800 
seven thousand
medium V GPUs.

464
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.990 
roughly four thousand six hundred
nodes, two hundred fifty petabytes

465
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.620 
and storage, three hundred forty tons,
for under twenty square meters,

466
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:17.390 
fifteen thousand
liters waters

467
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:22.090 
could that environment to
seventy degrees Celsius.

468
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.320 
and it's using certain
megawatts in power.

469
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:32.180 
so looking back when i was
introducing the system which is

470
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.940 
will be which
is actually

471
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.190 
the installation
phase of the

472
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:43.700 
compute center in anything
for the first system which

473
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:52.040 
is built up outside the US from IBM. we
are talking here about ten kilowatts

474
00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.830 
and we are talking about
roughly ten square meters

475
00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:01.920 
of our floor space. so you can simulate
also quantum computers within

476
00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:07.410 
a classic computing environment. and
the summit system for example can

477
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:13.810 
roughly simulate depending on the
simulation fifty to fifty two cubits.

478
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.940 
so this is when we are looking to the
ending environment, this twenty seven.

479
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:25.700 
IBM already is having in place our
fifty plus cubits system environment.

480
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.590 
so we are very close,

481
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:35.370 
a classic computer is not able anymore
to simulate and a condom computer.

482
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:41.580 
and you just have to remember
also if you like to add just

483
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:46.300 
another cubit, you have to
double our classical computing

484
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.040 
environment. so when we
are talking here about

485
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.490 
let's say fifty one or fifty two
or fifty three cubits, then

486
00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:56.210 
you have to double that type of
environment. and that's not

487
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.780 
possible anymore in the future.
so we are very very close

488
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.320 
to an environment
where we

489
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:07.260 
are not anymore able to
simulate quantum computers.

490
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:12.050 
and we really have to trust the outcome
of quantum computers when we are

491
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.050 
doing calculations
there.

492
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:19.490 
if you are interested in more or
if you are having any questions

493
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.680 
regarding my
presentation here and

494
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.370 
what I was talking about, feel

WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.510 
Before we start to go into more detail,

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.220 
about the constructional principles of the World Wide Web,

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.040 
it makes sense to have a short look on the history of the Web.

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.920 
The history of the web and the history of the internet are inseparable.

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.790 
The start of the internet one can say it was 1969,

6
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.770 
so it was forty five years ago.

7
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.350 
The start of the internet was,

8
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.570 
the internet started in the form of ARPANET.

9
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.980 
The ARPANET in '69 started with four computers. That was a research project

10
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.530 
to find out whether it's possible to let computers

11
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.980 
communicate which are run with different operational systems and which are

12
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.620 
involved in different networks.

13
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.330 
Internet started at universities so the four computers

14
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.990 
were located at the universities of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Stanford and Utah.

15
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.430 
And then you see within two years already twenty three hosts are linked

16
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
to the ARPANET and they are linked to each other via 15 nodes.

17
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.000 
'71 -the first email was sent. So for the ARPANET, the killer application was

18
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.720 
email sending and in 1972, the specification of the

19
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.580 
file transfer protocol was done one beside the email and as

20
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.780 
our important application of the internet.

21
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.860 
In 1973, the

22
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.950 
email protocol as MTP was specified and the first international node

23
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690 
joined the young internet.

24
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.080 
These were nodes in UK, in England and in Norway.

25
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.610 
In '83, so after about 15 years, already more than 500 hosts

26
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.270 
were connected to the internet.

27
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.920 
In '83 there was a changeover of the communication software

28
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.710 
from used in the ARPANET to TCP/IP

29
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.020 
protocol stack which was developed under the direction of Vincent Cerf

30
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.070 
and Robert Kahn.

31
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.630 
If one has a closer look then this would be the birth day

32
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.120 
of the internet as we know it today.

33
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
By the way, both Vin Cerf and

34
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.100 
Robert Kahn are fellows of HPI.

35
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
The separation was also done in '83, the separation

36
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.590 
of the ARPANET into a civilian and into a militarian part.

37
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.400 
And then in 1986

38
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.130 
internet started to get speed. Was done by the national science foundation in US

39
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.620 
which supported the NSFNET program to

40
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.500 
make it possible that all universities in US are connected to the internet.

41
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.010 
Two years later in 1988, the first internet worm

42
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.010 
occurred and interestingly 10% of the 60,000 hosts

43
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.080 
that in that time for their forming, the internet were affected.

44
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.580 
So the internet security from this moment became obvious to a broader

45
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.180 
public. And now you see that was a very

46
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.720 
fast development already '89.

47
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.130 
'89, twenty five years ago there were one hundred fifty thousand hosts

48
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.190 
connected to the internet and the original ARPANET

49
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.070 
was shut down.

50
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.490 
Then in 1990, the development of the first web browser

51
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.610 
and the first web server was done by Robert Cailliau and Tim Bernerns-Lee.

52
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.120 
So this was the birth of the Web

53
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.050 
of that internet application which

54
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.760 
pushed the internet to become the communication infrastructure of our

55
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.010 
days. 1991, there was the first version of the HTTP protocol

56
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.850 
and then very important date for development of the world wide web

57
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.290 
was '93 when the first browser this was the

58
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.490 
NCSA Mosaic browser,

59
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.790 
was offered with the graphical user interface.

60
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.600 
And from that moment on, it becomes very simple to navigate

61
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.750 
through the world wide web because it was not necessary to type in

62
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.700 
concrete comments. It was possible to move with a mouse and

63
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.030 
click on such a graphical user interface.

64
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.410 
And then the development of the web

65
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.710 
took speed and though in 1994, the

66
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.490 
W3C was founded

67
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.020 
by Netscape and this was

68
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.780 
that took care about the development of the World Wide Web.

69
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.840 
Then there was a question

70
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.750 
about browser- which browser is used, which browser is most popular

71
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.010 
in the web, and their competition. It was started at microsoft. Microsoft

72
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.030 
became obvious that there was a very strong development

73
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.760 
of the internet so Microsoft provided with its Windows 95

74
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.860 
browser, the known browser- the Internet Explorer.

75
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.530 
Also in a few years

76
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.260 
economical world, finance and business discovered the web for their own purposes.

77
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.160 
Many young entrepreneurs start to develop new services in the worldwide

78
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.350 
which can be reached over the world wide web.

79
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.310 
Often they are called "dot coms" from the dot com.

80
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.460 
Top-level domain of this young entrepreneurs.

81
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.600 
1999 are the first generation of mobile internet

82
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:59.610 
came up the WAP protocol, the I-Mode in Japan and then

83
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.260 
the economical development of this application,

84
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.050 
of this new web application become very

85
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.530 
realistic speed of development. Some of this young entrepreneurial,

86
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.670 
some of this young internet companies

87
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.460 
were considered more value by the stock market than the biggest international

88
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.300 
traditional companies.

89
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.220 
This development in 2001 got to an end.

90
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.050 
When I was speaking that the dot-com bubble was bursting,

91
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.590 
so as a boom of this young internet company collapses, this

92
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.830 
internet companies that offered a lot of very nice new idea,

93
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.970 
how one can use the web but in most cases as they did not earn money,

94
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.300 
they only felt or burned money from the venture capitalists.

95
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.280 
It was an interesting time

96
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.840 
in that because all the new developments of web application were done.

97
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.650 
Up to this moment, there

98
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.300 
were companies, there were people that provided content but

99
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.970 
for the usal user of the web, it was difficult

100
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.790 
to provide content. And in that years

101
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.890 
one speaks also of development of web

102
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.970 
some new type of internet application

103
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.420 
start to be connected to the web and one

104
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.790 
for example was Wikipedia. Wikipedia now a largest

105
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.150 
site which provide information

106
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:55.430 
and the content from wikipedia and from other such services are provided

107
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.210 
by people like you and me.

108
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.890 
In 2002, the web

109
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.150 
start again

110
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.390 
with some applications, with some

111
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.380 
successful dot-coms, which

112
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.060 
crystallized from the many, many applications from the dot-com bubble.

113
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.460 
In that years Google, for example, Amazon, E-bay

114
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.990 
various airlines say start to provide their service in their offices.

115
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:40.440 
So officers is over estimated, development now some really serious new companies occur

116
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.700 
which provide content, which provide services over the

117
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:52.500 
World Wide Web. And then a new type of network occurs. This was

118
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.130 
in 2003, the advent of social networks.

119
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.320 
For example Myspace

120
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.830 
started in 2003 with initially more than

121
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.560 
200,000 users daily.

122
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.340 
Today we have forgotten it so it's a very fast development.

123
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.750 
Different is with facebook. Facebook was started in 2004

124
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:25.720 
launched in February and 1 million users already one year later.

125
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.730 
One million users in December 2004, 1.39 billion active users

126
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:36.690 
now in February 2015.

127
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:45.050 
Then in 2004 UMTS was commercially available which allows to

128
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.790 
get more bandwidth with mobile devices.

129
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.860 
And then 2005, and around

130
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.590 
Web 3.0 was developed.

131
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.580 
As a research in the area of Semantic Web of Social Web and Service Web

132
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.180 
it was pushed forward and showed new results.

133
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.230 
Then 2007, the first iPhone appear and iPhones

134
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:18.270 
will change the usage of such smartphone by providing a touch screen revolution.

135
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.590 
So today is a smartphone market,

136
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:29.540 
breakthrough of mobile web was pushed by the invention of such devices.

137
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:37.180 
2008 Android officially was available for the first time.

138
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.090 
2009 new concepts

139
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:46.060 
under the name "Cloud Computing" become more and more important,

140
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.290 
become a trend which is particularly for all kind of economy,

141
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:57.550 
important for the coming year. So the processing power and the memory

142
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.930 
that could be used over, that could be very cheaply used over the web

143
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.090 
allows the people to

144
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:12.850 
store their data in the cloud to run applications. So it's really an important development

145
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.990 
because if all this processing is done in the web, the device

146
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:24.030 
typically the mobile device is only needed to show the results.

147
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.430 
Then 2010

148
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:34.030 
iPad holds renaissance of the tablet PC. It was not the first tablet PC but

149
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.640 
it makes tablet PCs very fashionable and usable in particular

150
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.370 
for the usage of services that are provided over the World Wide Web.

151
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:51.650 
And then when we speak of today, the web is meanwhile ubiquitous,

152
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.910 
mobile internet is widespread, we discuss and development

153
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.550 
is ongoing on smart homes, smart grid and

154
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.830 
other important concepts of the future. If we look to the industrial

155
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:12.300 
parts and it's an industry for and other development which

156
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:19.810 
show and prove that web is completely changing how we live

157
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:20.930 
and how we work.

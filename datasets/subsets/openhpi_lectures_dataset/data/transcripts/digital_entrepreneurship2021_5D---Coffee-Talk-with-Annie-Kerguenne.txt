2
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.440 
So, welcome. Welcome to our coffee
talk session for our openHPI

3
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.500 
course "Digital Entrepreneurship".
With this course, we aim

4
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.640 
to introduce you to the world of
digital entrepreneurship. We

5
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.660 
are very glad to have Annie Kerguenne today as an
expert on collaboration and virtual teamwork

6
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.620 
and we are really excited that
you're taking the time today

7
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.930 
to talk about your view on
digital entrepreneurship.

8
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.190 
I hope you have your
coffee or tea ready.

9
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.900 
Let's get into it.

10
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.130 
So, first of all could i ask you
to please introduce yourself

11
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.250 
to our viewers. Who are you, what is
your background, what do you do?

12
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.470 
Of course. Thank you Katharina
for having me . I'm

13
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.750 
honoured to be invited here as
an expert. So, my name is Annie

14
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.210 
Kerguenne and I am at the
HPI. Here I am responsible

15
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.170 
for design thinking trainings and
trainings in digital transformation.

16
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.990 
Respectfully, trainings for
for professionals. So,

17
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.430 
what I'm doing is developing trainings,
leading trainings and coaching teams.

18
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.510 
And we do that more and more, also,
remotely, as you can imagine,

19
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.870 
but the base is our on-campus trainings.
My background is economics and

20
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.910 
linguistics, so sociolinguistic
and psycholinguistics

21
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.900 
and before I joined HPI, I've been
working as a strategic planner

22
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.010 
in innovation agencies,

23
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.810 
advertising agencies
and in marketing.

24
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.770 
Thank you very much. So, what is
your perspective, what is your

25
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.840 
personal view on digital
entrepreneurship? What does it mean

26
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.750 
to you, this phrase?
So yeah, first of all

27
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.010 
if you have a course that you
label "digital entrepreneurship",

28
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.500 
then you can be sure that
it's going to be full.

29
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.520 
Right, digital
entrepreneurship

30
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.810 
is, before everything
else, a buzzword.

31
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.710 
So, it makes sense to have a closer
look behind these words and

32
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.540 
when we talk about digital
entrepreneurship, maybe we shall

33
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.170 
have a closer look at entrepreneurship
first and when you have,

34
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.900 
when you go behind the word, when
you go to the meaning, to the

35
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.490 
roots of this word
entrepreneurship, it has very

36
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.240 
much to do with making
things happen,

37
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.320 
with commitment, with accountability,
with responsibility also.

38
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.790 
And I like that very much, because
when you act words digital,

39
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.650 
all these characteristics of
entrepreneurship become more

40
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.210 
important because digital entrepreneurship,
in a way, scales everything,

41
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.970 
adds impact to your responsibility
as an entrepreneur, to

42
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.070 
your commitment or your
accountability as an entrepreneur.

43
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.320 
So, this is what I would
associate with the word or with

44
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.100 
the expression digital entrepreneurship.
And put it in very easy words is

45
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.570 
like an entrepreneur without
digital, you have an idea,

46
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.560 
you have an idea where you think,
maybe this could add value

47
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.790 
in the future for users, then you
team up with others in order

48
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.940 
to make it real. Then you test
it, you get feedback and

49
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.280 
you try to implement or to integrate
this new idea into the given system.

50
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.430 
Right. So this is entrepreneurship.
And digital entrepreneurship would

51
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.160 
accelerate this process in one dimension
and on the other side also add complexity

52
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.010 
to the whole code. Very, very true.
Well, thank you so much. This

53
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.410 
is an excellent definition.
I think you, kind of, should

54
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.100 
write that down right away. So, you already
said it's about involving others.

55
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.710 
So, this kind of that naturally flows to our
topic today about the collaboration aspect.

56
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:53.130 
Now, you said you have been a
trainer, a leader, a coach in this

57
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.560 
respect for many many years. So, if you
look back, has digitalization really

58
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.370 
changed the way we collaborate?
Is teamwork today differently

59
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.510 
compared to a couple
of years ago?

60
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.770 
A very good question. I think it
depends. It depends on

61
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.150 
the context you are working
in. There may be contexts where

62
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.760 
collaboration wouldn't have played
such an important role before hand

63
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.820 
and now all of
a sudden,

64
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.530 
with the digital technology
also supported by the pandemic,

65
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.010 
all of a sudden team work becomes relevant,
teamwork becomes crucial

66
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.750 
for making things work, for
continuing producing value.

67
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.610 
But if you go into other
contexts where collaboration

68
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.590 
always has played an important role and
as I come from the creative industries,

69
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.740 
collaboration always played an
important role. You never

70
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.780 
invent or come up with a creative
concept on your own. It's

71
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.950 
always a team work and iI would
say here digitalisation or

72
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.070 
remote team work has changed a
lot of things. Beforehand, you

73
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.990 
would just meet in a physical space,
right. You go into an office or

74
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.950 
a place. If you
are a start-up,

75
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.370 
maybe at home first but you meet
physically. So collaboration is

76
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:37.090 
much more easy then because there are a lot of
informal like interactions, informal connections,

77
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.310 
emotional connections
that can just grow.

78
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.700 
If you do that remotely, you
have a kind of filter.

79
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.830 
We like to call it the aquarium
effect because it's like

80
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.230 
being in a bowl and
you can see the other one, but

81
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.290 
there are a lot of
senses are simply cut.

82
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.180 
Here, if you want to make
your teamwork work,

83
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.980 
especially in the creative business
or in the innovation business,

84
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.520 
you have to come up
with new technique,

85
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.580 
new rules to enable collaboration.
And as a leader it's your job.

86
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.890 
I mean, it's your job to
provide your team with a space

87
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.580 
where they can collaborate and if
this space is a digital space,

88
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.540 
you have other rules. You have to
provide a new infrastructure

89
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.830 
and a new way of working together.
Right. Now, one thing that you said

90
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.660 
really kind of struck me. You
said that an entrepreneur or

91
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.360 
like someone who wants to invent and
is creative cannot do that alone.

92
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.330 
Now, if we look into literature or if we
read newspapers, there's sometimes

93
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.900 
this myth about the big entrepreneur
and there are many especially

94
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.220 
male entrepreneurs we read about,
where you feel like - oh yeah,

95
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.430 
they are the genius. So what would
you say - is that just a myth or

96
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.080 
don't we see the
people behind?

97
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:21.630 
I guess that there may be single
personalities or characters

98
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.410 
that have this
kind of genius

99
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:32.420 
three hundred and sixty degree
perspective on the world. Yeah,

100
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.530 
like Leonardo da Vinci and if you
have a closer look at those

101
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.670 
people or those persons
in the history and in

102
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:46.230 
the backgrounds you see, that they have
a very diverse background. That they

103
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.390 
are experts in
many many many fields

104
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:56.840 
and some people may have this
talent of being

105
00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.390 
able to change the perspective and
to see things from different

106
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.110 
point of views. But most of
us, most of the people -

107
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:13.710 
they work more easily

108
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:20.020 
if they have their own perspective and
if I can add different perspectives

109
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.800 
by working in a team. So this
would, for my perspective, be

110
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.090 
more the standard. Yes, there are
the lonely genius but

111
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.010 
most of the times when you look
behind yeah it's not just

112
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.690 
that. They have a different
diverse education but

113
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.890 
they have been inspired
by others too. So

114
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.590 
most of the time it's the
teamwork. Right, so

115
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:49.500 
with respect to the challenges of virtual
teamwork and collaboration, you already said

116
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:56.790 
it's your responsibility as a
leader that your team feels whole

117
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.450 
although they are now
working remotely, digitally.

118
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:09.670 
What is your impression? Are people
skilled enough to enact this

119
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.080 
virtual leadership? I mean, does
that come naturally to younger

120
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.320 
people and not so naturally to
older people? Is it a skill

121
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.590 
I can learn to to be a
virtual team leader?

122
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.930 
I don't think that it is a natural skill.
Even though the younger generation

123
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.490 
grows up with digital technologies,
so they're more used to interact

124
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.710 
in the digital space, but when it
comes to team work there are

125
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.350 
other things that comes
into play - like working

126
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.130 
together would always include
also frictions and conflict.

127
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.600 
Right. Working
together as a team needs

128
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:59.690 
a feedback culture in order
to grow as a team. So

129
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.120 
some people would say if a team
is not able to solve conflict,

130
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.010 
to have conversations that are
that are not just harmonious,

131
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:15.730 
they won't be able to reach the full
potential of a performance as a team.

132
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.620 
But what it needs is a feedback
culture, is rules that the teams

133
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.460 
would create for themselves.
Certain processes,

134
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.300 
certain ways of
working together and this

135
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.200 
is something that isn't
just there. This is something

136
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.020 
that you have to build up.

137
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.880 
You can learn that.
In design thinking, also

138
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.370 
in other areas, in system thinking
you have a couple of tools,

139
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.300 
a couple of methods that can help teams
to organize themselves and to organize

140
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:58.450 
themselves and a very good team
work in the virtual space.

141
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.500 
So what would you - what would be
your future outlook? Now, with

142
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:09.660 
the pandemic we have all been working
virtually. I think, many teams have been

143
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:16.910 
created, maintained digitally. We see that
people become digital entrepreneurs,

144
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.160 
although that is not that easy.
So, what is your perspective?

145
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.380 
How will this field of digital
entrepreneurial teams - how will that develop?

146
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.530 
So, that is a huge question.
Yes, okay. But there are

147
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.810 
some aspects of this question
that I find

148
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.320 
very interesting at the moment. So, some
questions that I find very interesting.

149
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.850 
The first thing is, I think

150
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:54.450 
what has to be developed. If we talk
about digital entrepreneurship

151
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.510 
seeing the entrepreneur, right, the
start-up founder, for instance,

152
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.940 
this responsibility aspect will
become more and more important,

153
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.810 
because if I'm doing something
and if I'm doing something with

154
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:11.190 
the help of digital technology,
it becomes huge. It scales. It

155
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.540 
has much more impact

156
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.650 
than something that is just in
this closed system

157
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.980 
of the real world. For
instance, if I decide

158
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.650 
as an entrepreneur to come up
with an online course to enable

159
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.230 
much more people to get into
strategic design thinking and

160
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.950 
I don't reach just thirty people in my
course on campus but three hundred people,

161
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.430 
it's more responsibility and I have
to be aware of that responsibility

162
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.510 
because if things go wrong, it's three
hundred, it's not just the three hundred

163
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.530 
participants that
will multiply

164
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.630 
the critics, of course. And also the
good things that they like. So

165
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.380 
educating entrepreneurs
of tomorrow

166
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.960 
about this huge responsibility
and about the

167
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:13.390 
the important tasks that they have
to really know what they are doing,

168
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.290 
when they're

169
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.450 
operating with digital
technology is one thing.

170
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.880 
And the other topic that I find
interesting is the question,

171
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:30.350 
what is the potential of digital
technology or of digital working

172
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.880 
space? What is the potential of digital
working space and what are the limitations

173
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:42.320 
and what we can see in our
courses is something surprising.

174
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.040 
It was surprising for me because
there are some, for instance,

175
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.360 
working phases in design thinking
that work even better in

176
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.230 
the digital space. And others where
you really have a hard time.

177
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.690 
I heard of other companies
who would say, in the future

178
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.310 
everything that is analysis and
synthesis and research and

179
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.580 
these kind of things - we can do
that remotely, but as soon as

180
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.720 
we want our people to get
creative and to let the

181
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.250 
chance come in and to come up with
things that are not planned, then

182
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.390 
it's better when we have them together
in a physical space.

183
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.920 
This is maybe
something that

184
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:36.860 
that we should explore to really
be more conscious about when

185
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.500 
we use a virtual
space which is sometimes even

186
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.550 
a better a better place to be
for some work. And

187
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:52.300 
when it would really be something
that would create hurdles.

188
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.410 
And then it's our decision, well,
either we have to stay in this

189
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.230 
virtual space and then we explicitly
have to overcome those hurdles,

190
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:08.530 
or we say, no, this is a work moat
where the physical interaction

191
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:14.430 
adds so much more that it's really
worth the effort. Right.

192
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.790 
That's a fascinating thought.
So, thank you so much.

193
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.850 
And before we go, there's
a one last thing.

194
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:29.890 
Imagine I'm a fairy and I grant you
one wish, what would be your wish for

195
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.200 
this field, for
your field?

196
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:34.560 
Oh, that's a good one.

197
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:42.410 
And I know what I would wish
for. I would wish for a dictionary -

198
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.910 
a dictionary that would translate
the digital language of

199
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.880 
some engineers, for
instance, for everybody.

200
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.470 
I think there is a
big gap between

201
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.930 
digital technology
talk and

202
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:10.540 
daily conversation. So a translator would
be a good thing. An algorithm translator,

203
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:16.650 
a translator of what is my admin just
telling me. So this would be my wish.

204
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.210 
That's a great wish. So, Annie,
thank you so much. This has been

205
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.520 
enlightening. Thank you for
joining us today. You're welcome.

206
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.610 
It was a pleasure.

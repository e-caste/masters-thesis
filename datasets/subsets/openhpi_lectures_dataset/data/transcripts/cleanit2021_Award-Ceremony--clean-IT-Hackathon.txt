1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:09.689 
I welcome you to the afternoon of our Clean IT Conference and this is not only today's event, but there have already been

2
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:23.920 
in the run-up to the event - namely we organised a big hackathon on 19th and 20th March, the challenge sponsors were SAP

3
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
and as in the VMware - you will also get to know the gentlemen when you then speak to the winners in the ceremony.

4
00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:34.000 
The race went

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.250 
about it, about 50 students took part.

6
00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:46.060 
About half from the HPI, the second half from other teams that could be formed from that. And they then worked hard

7
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.649 
the two days. And then it had to be evaluated, there is now the award ceremony, an order had to be found.

8
00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.500 
at the award ceremony. There is also not only the wet handshake, but also a small cheque then to take away.

9
00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:18.049 
And we will now introduce the teams. I would like to ask Team EcoBack to come forward - Where are you? -

10
00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.250 
to the front.

11
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.599 
That was about the SAP Challenge, which was SAP Challenge:

12
00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.329 
How can business customer data,

13
00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:34.939 
how can the other data that is generated in SAP systems be used to provide consumer

14
00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.450 
when he shops, to make CO2-conscious purchases?

15
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.519 
I could read out what that means in detail, but the guys can explain it much better.

16
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.349 
So show us very briefly what you were going to do there - microphone either here or take a stick microphone if you need that.

17
00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:10.009 
I would now like to introduce you to our project, which we created at Hack HPI together with my team. And first of all

18
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.610 
was our idea: Yes, we are all people who want to create something better and leave a good positive impression,

19
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.389 
just like you, of course.

20
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.250 
That's why we met here, under the theme of Clean IT.

21
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:36.370 
That's exactly what our team is - we got together the weekend before last as motivated students and wanted to have a

22
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.349 
problem creatively together.

23
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.050 
And the team then consisted of Matti, Lukas, me - Duy, Max and Tim.

24
00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:54.729 
We thought about it together: Yes, we want to do something innovative within a short period of time, actually.

25
00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.349 
24 hours working time.

26
00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:06.449 
Our problem then was the SAP product, the Product Footprint Manager, which we took. And the question:

27
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:15.599 
How might we help consumers to make environmentally conscious decisions, based on the data of the SAP

28
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.050 
Footprint Management application?

29
00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:24.500 
That was exactly our problem, which we then took apart to see what we wanted to tackle in the first place.

30
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.150 
of problems.

31
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:35.830 
We then clearly established that there is the human factor, the consumer. Then there's the footprint thing,

32
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:44.229 
that we simply want to create awareness about the topic of ecology and how we can manage to change the whole market behaviour.

33
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:51.930 
in such a way that it makes halfway sense for the consumer to move in that direction, as well as for the consumer to move in that direction.

34
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.550 
the market.

35
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.800 
Right, we then put our heads together.

36
00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.080 
What can we contribute to ecology as a single individual?

37
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.500 
So that means: What can each individual do? Have you, of course, thought about what you would do in your everyday life in your place?

38
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.550 
to simply live greener?

39
00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:19.040 
And clearly, of course, buying behaviour is a very crucial decision,

40
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.100 
which has to be made on a daily basis, and that's where we started.

41
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.529 
So, everybody just has to or the first step is always to go into the supermarket and then look: are there any

42
00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:30.350 
alternatives?

43
00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:37.730 
And then to bring the IT aspect into it, we thought about: How do you make it so intuitive for the consumer?

44
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.779 
without him having to make a direct decision or any kind of increase, any kind of effort at all, in order to be able to

45
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.899 
to go in that direction, that is, to act ecologically. Since we thought about it: Payback is a super IT concept, which we can

46
00:04:51.899 --> 00:05:02.740 
to create something green with this IT system infrastructure, something much better, exactly.

47
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:11.680 
Basically Payback is actually like this, the concept is built in such a way that consumption is rewarded with overconsumption,

48
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.089 
so you get points to get - I don't know - presents or something else. And we tried to change that,

49
00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.339 
so that it becomes green, exactly. Our ideas:

50
00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:27.670 
We have just developed business models from this, created halfway concepts that make sense and that just in

51
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.990 
an ecological direction.

52
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.350 
On the one hand, the B2C concept, because clearly, you could just use this payback method for consumers and customers to do this

53
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.379 
not to enable overconsumption, that would not be Clean IT, of course. But to promote ecological behaviour, which would be

54
00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.750 
means for example giving discounts for products that are of course sustainable.

55
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.250 
Of course, there is also an extremely large market potential, which will also grow in the near future. See organic shops,

56
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:09.180 
which are sprouting up everywhere in every district. And we want to use that for that. Likewise

57
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:17.079 
Gamefication aspects, so it's just intuitive and Payback, I think, could be such a solution or we think. At the same time

58
00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:23.800 
of course you have to look at it from an economic perspective to make it convenient for as well.

59
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.660 
Payback in itself as infrastructure - why would they even do that?

60
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.389 
For one thing market potential - as just mentioned - and also it's simply a trend, a very big trend and probably

61
00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.649 
long-lasting trend. Likewise - how can you acquire partners?

62
00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.629 
Means other supermarkets, that they just naturally use that as well.

63
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:52.480 
We need partners and of course the advertising aspect also plays a role as well as in the increasing revenue through such

64
00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:02.699 
discount campaigns - just that one uses this as a catalyst and somehow shifts the market movements there,

65
00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.649 
that it's then green. And that was our Clean IT idea.

66
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:16.300 
Exactly our goals in this respect are for one thing, very important - ss should be intuitive and somehow facilitate

67
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.889 
for the end consumer and actually hardly noticeable.

68
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:29.600 
By giving incentives to these consumers to go in a greener direction, just so that the perception is to

69
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:38.970 
how green behaviour is integrated into society. And also of course to strengthen the markets in the

70
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.259 
sense of ecological behaviour will then be rewarded, also for the economy.

71
00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:52.459 
Our use cases or our target partners would then be supermarkets for the time being, so that we can keep it small for the time being and then maybe

72
00:07:52.470 --> 00:08:00.629 
then spin it off into the larger scale, gastronomy and coffee shops. Yes, now to our application, which we then, like.

73
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:10.029 
within 24 hours, as fast as we could. And we visualised that exactly

74
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:12.180 
from theory into practice.

75
00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:20.149 
So, in the 24 hours we have developed a web application that is there so that in the supermarket, after you have shopped

76
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:25.149 
you can look at: How environmentally friendly was the shopping and what can possibly be improved?

77
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:33.470 
That is, we assume: We went to the supermarket, we get a QR code printed on the bill, which is

78
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:39.960 
the contents of the shopping list. And so we then open up our web application, we can first of all connect it with our

79
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:47.590 
system, with our account. And now we have the option that we scan the QR code directly, which is on

80
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.850 
our invoice, that is, we go to the QR code scanner.

81
00:08:51.139 --> 00:09:02.389 
And now that we have scanned the corresponding QR code, we see directly an overview of what our purchase contained

82
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:09.850 
and how good and environmentally friendly this purchase was in terms of CO2 emissions, but also a resulting score,

83
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:16.250 
which we calculate to then give an overview, also how that compares to other products.

84
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:25.059 
So we see the individual purchases and we can now - if we want to - go directly to the alternatives and in the alternatives

85
00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:26.710 
we now see what we can do better.

86
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:32.830 
So we bought cow's milk, for example, and now we have the possibility to replace it with oat milk

87
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.850 
and also see directly what the environmental impact of the whole thing is.

88
00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:44.830 
We can next see our last purchases by opening our history, but we can also open a

89
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.960 
shopping list for next time.

90
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.350 
If we do the shopping now, we can make a list.

91
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:56.730 
We can directly see an overview of how environmentally friendly certain purchases are. For example, if we buy a steak in

92
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.840 
in our shopping list, it will immediately show in red that it is probably not so environmentally friendly. We can also search for products

93
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:09.350 
and get again directly displayed which products would be environmentally friendly and how, we can select those, and if

94
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:15.850 
And if we were now in the supermarket, they take oat milk and can choose

95
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.549 
tick which one we have already put in the shopping basket.

96
00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:26.720 
And now, last of all, of course, the crucial point for the supermarkets. We have discount codes and this is the intensification

97
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.250 
for the users and also for the supermarkets to use this product.

98
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:37.330 
So you can see here now that for example Edeka, where we were shopping brings now gives us a discount

99
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:44.789 
for oat milk where we would get 10%. This means that environmentally friendly purchases are reduced and thus intensified,

100
00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:52.139 
that you do them more. And we can go back in our home screen for a moment, there we see an overview, see

101
00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:57.879 
again, how much CO2 we have produced with our last purchases, we also see a progression, whether we have become better or not.

102
00:10:57.879 --> 00:10:59.250 
recently or not.

103
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.250 
And if we want, we can also compare ourselves with friends family in a leader board.

104
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.970 
Exactly, so that was our application that we developed within 24 hours, and now you can of course

105
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.370 
put a lot more work into it and connect the whole thing with a lot more business logic.

106
00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:20.649 
But that's EcoBack for now, our green shopping application.

107
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:41.620 
You have won the third prize and the jury particularly appreciated a) that you have done a good job on

108
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:53.379 
on this SAP database. And with the idea there to incentivise the purchase, so vouchers, discounts in this very flexible -

109
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:54.980 
what can I really do?

110
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:04.850 
Has convinced and for that you deserve a little reward! Who can I give it to?

111
00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:10.450 
So I have to take it myself.

112
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:25.899 
I can't take it.

113
00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:35.850 
With that, we thank you! And for the second winning team - in this one it's even true

114
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.590 
two and second place coincide.

115
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:50.360 
I am pleased to introduce Jörg Alexander Albrecht from the company VMware. And accordingly

116
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.440 
the Clean VM team. Introduce yourself, please!

117
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.340 
Thank you very much!

118
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:10.899 
So indeed, VMware, VM stands for virtual machine and also Team Clean VM has a challenge

119
00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:11.870 
Edited.

120
00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:21.840 
At the end of the day, one of our main areas at VMware is to virtualise data centres, so a software

121
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:29.590 
Defined Data Centre. And the data centres are ultimately, as we've heard a lot of times today, the

122
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:37.179 
actually the factories of the digitised world. Up to 2% of the total energy consumption goes just to the data centres

123
00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:37.830 
back.

124
00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:45.110 
We've already heard, like aviation actually. And the question is: So how can we make these data centres more efficient

125
00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:54.720 
and at the same time how can we increase the share of renewable energies, which also varies?

126
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.450 
available, in different regions as possible?

127
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:09.700 
And the obvious solution is to say that you move the workloads from one data centre to the other.

128
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:16.509 
to the other, depending on how the renewable energies are available there at the moment. Whether it's windy, the sun is shining or the sun is shining.

129
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:18.250 
or it's night or day.

130
00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:27.419 
And the specific task for the team was to either develop a simulator, a game perhaps, which would demonstrate that

131
00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:36.870 
or also to build an algorithm that ultimately calculates and decides when a workload should be pushed from A to B.

132
00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:38.490 
should be moved.

133
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.220 
And there are just very complex assumptions to be made for that.

134
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:49.450 
And that's what Team Clean VM has done and I'd like to ask them to come on stage to present that briefly.

135
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:08.799 
Thank you very much for the introduction Mr. Albrecht! As you have already heard, our challenge was quasi - we want data centres.

136
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.490 
with 100 % renewable energy, we want to make 100 % renewable energy usable. And well, that sounded earlier

137
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.769 
a bit, 100% renewable energies -

138
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:25.100 
we know that is necessary and there is good news: renewable energy is also getting cheaper and cheaper, and if the

139
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.679 
plants are in place, then the stuff practically falls from the sky. So that's also very cheap, you don't depend on anybody -.

140
00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.129 
maybe it's also quite interesting from a security point of view.

141
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:40.019 
But there are one or two challenges, because the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow, and, of course, the wind doesn't always blow.

142
00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:44.049 
it's best to use the energy when it's available.

143
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.419 
So that's a bit of the preliminary consideration that we need to make.

144
00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:51.649 
Well, we basically have to think a little bit differently about energy.

145
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.710 
What does that mean for our data centres?

146
00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.730 
In the classical model, it sort of follows from the load in our data centre, what that draws in terms of power, at that moment from the

147
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.149 
network.

148
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.649 
And what we basically have to do is turn it over once.

149
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.710 
It's not that complicated now.

150
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.450 
But we'll come back to that in a moment.

151
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.789 
So we have to orientate ourselves to match our load to the power that we have available at that moment.

152
00:16:17.789 --> 00:16:18.149 
have.

153
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:24.850 
What do you do first, if you have 24 hours and a very complex subject area, on which research is already being done -

154
00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:32.159 
You first try to make sensible assumptions, read up on the subject and that's why we also tried, yes, to make sensible assumptions.

155
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:36.879 
assumptions so that our model can be used as well as possible in reality.

156
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:43.279 
A sum of reasonable assumptions is for example, we have agreed with VMware, we have a few VMs running there and we

157
00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:49.149 
have some form - for example, statistical data - about how it looks in terms of resource consumption.

158
00:16:49.149 --> 00:16:56.779 
of these VMs? And also, for example, the question: can the VM and what's running in it be accelerated by having more

159
00:16:56.789 --> 00:17:01.340 
computing power? Exactly, then maybe we'll take a look at it first.

160
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.720 
What does it look like if we power such a data centre with renewable energy?

161
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:12.099 
Schematically kind of like this, we have kind of a little bit of wind, maybe in the morning, then we have a nice big

162
00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:16.549 
peak with a sunny midday and then in the evening maybe a bit of a storm, that's the first observation we hit.

163
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:22.769 
Okay, there may be some form of base load that we can hold all the time. That's a sensible one for now.

164
00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:28.930 
realisation, but not necessarily what we're interested in, but what's actually the interesting part are

165
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:34.829 
these peaks that we have to exploit somehow. The sun is there, the wind is there and at some point it's gone again. And

166
00:17:34.829 --> 00:17:39.549 
we basically have the possibility to store it or to use that at the moment we just have it.

167
00:17:41.339 --> 00:17:43.660 
There are several approaches.

168
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:49.680 
The first approach we have thought about, that takes place in a data centre.

169
00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:52.559 
We already know this,

170
00:17:52.569 --> 00:17:59.680 
these approaches already on the operating system level, we had that in the course Programming of Parallel Systems, the

171
00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.690 
here at HPI, and we thought okay, let's maybe transfer that to a computer centre. So if we

172
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:12.390 
our VM and there's a job running, it kind of runs for a certain amount of time and it kind of needs a certain amount of time.

173
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:20.670 
power - then of course the question is okay, can we change that, and can we speed that up,

174
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.450 
by putting more computing power in there.

175
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.029 
If that's the case, then of course we want to put as much processing power in there as is somehow possible so that we can

176
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:30.349 
get it finished as quickly as possible while the sun is still shining.

177
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:36.519 
If that is not possible, that can also be the case, for example with very memory-intensive jobs, then we want to give it as much time as possible.

178
00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:43.640 
little power available, so that we just have these peaks free for the

179
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.140 
jobs that we can actually accelerate. That's sort of what we can do in the data centre. And the second thing

180
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:55.309 
is and that's where we get to the point of load shifting, where we shift load back and forth between the data centres.

181
00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:03.980 
The third option is well, if we just kind of over use our power supply, then we can then load shift.

182
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.150 
to other data centres that are not yet working at full capacity.

183
00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:13.529 
That would be the first, that would be the first idea. But we thought: Well, what we actually don't want is now on

184
00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:18.769 
cramp that we never access our memories or that we never access the net. But what we

185
00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:24.680 
actually want to do is the local supply that we have there at the data centre, to always use this optimally is what we want to do.

186
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.579 
actually want to do - and

187
00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:29.160 
here the green arrow becomes interesting again.

188
00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:35.140 
To bring the load in until our data centre can optimally use the renewable energy that is currently being fed in.

189
00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:35.849 
can utilise.

190
00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:44.660 
Exactly, that looks like this once here in this example. And now, however, we have another example: well, if you

191
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:50.400 
load, then it could be that you are pulling load away from a data centre, which could be an optimal utilisation of a data centre.

192
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.279 
is located. That's right, but that's where the simulation that we've developed comes into play a little bit, which we're looking at

193
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:57.569 
could.

194
00:19:57.569 --> 00:20:04.333 
If we move load away from the other data centre, then that again has the opportunity to do these first 2 optimisation steps

195
00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:09.140 
even more clearly. And then it may just be that it is in a position to use even more resources for the

196
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.759 
for jobs that can then be accelerated.

197
00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:16.460 
Exactly, what did we actually build in those 24 hours?

198
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.950 
We built a simulation, which runs once with a web front end for a visualisation, there you can also

199
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.900 
user input, for example to enter data:

200
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:30.960 
Okay, how much power plant capacity for solar panels, for wind energy and so on?

201
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.930 
do I actually have on site that I can use. And we have built a back end, that's where our simulation is running, that's where

202
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:44.680 
our data modelling and that's where exactly this load distribution takes place in a simulated way,

203
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.750 
as I have just sketched it. So and what one would have to build on it now, of course, would be in some form such a

204
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.829 
bit of code for integration, that's why it's so important that we've tried to make assumptions that make sense,

205
00:20:55.839 --> 00:21:02.549 
which can then be transferred to reality. And then, of course, we have to connect this somehow to system data.

206
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.759 
Exactly and now I'm going to do what you normally never do, which is a little live demo.

207
00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:17.119 
Now the first problem is that this is a foreign computer and the gentleman with his finger would have to come forward once

208
00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:19.660 
or at least bring his finger over, that would be quite wonderful.

209
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.339 
Thank you to the finger.

210
00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:35.869 
Perfectly super, right here we see once our front end and now we have once exemplary on weather data quasi simulated -.

211
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.799 
How could such an energy supply look like?

212
00:21:38.809 --> 00:21:43.630 
how could such a distribution of load from our data centre look like during the day?

213
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:50.200 
And we can just run it now, and then we can see already from the colour and the size once

214
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.779 
how much renewable energy we are using and secondly how well are we actually using it?

215
00:21:54.779 --> 00:22:02.079 
So, are we still partly using electricity from the grid, do we still partly have energy free and we see quasi that

216
00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:04.549 
we're also doing relatively well here in the simulation at the optimum.

217
00:22:05.809 --> 00:22:14.170 
Exactly then we have visualised the whole thing again nicely and we can look at it again here ok, how much power?

218
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:20.920 
has actually been drawn into a data centre over the course of the day. And also how did it look in our renewable energy supply?

219
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:27.000 
looked like. And it's looking pretty good in this simulation for now, exactly, and we've got here again the supply of

220
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.809 
wind and solar energy.

221
00:22:33.809 --> 00:22:36.500 
Now, of course, we have to switch to the presentation, respectively

222
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.869 
that would be the last slide and then I thank you for your attention.

223
00:22:40.869 --> 00:22:46.519 
But before I do that, I would like to close with a little appeal, because we are gathered here as people with

224
00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:51.660 
networks, with specialised expertise and in creative positions that can make a difference.

225
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:58.130 
So I would like to appeal to that: Let's use this concentrated power, this concentrated creativity, and not say to ourselves that can

226
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:04.339 
but let us use this power in politics, in economy,

227
00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:10.730 
in business, in science and create the solutions that will bring us to this goal.

228
00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:20.480 
Thank you very much!

229
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:31.549 
Thanks for the challenge and Clean VM won the second prize of the hackathon. Will briefly say why, then.

230
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:39.750 
we will give you the prize. First of all, we really liked the fact that they really tried to make the very

231
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.099 
complex problem, that is, to make basic assumptions.

232
00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:45.509 
It's not just about the weather.

233
00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:50.849 
It's also about the efficiencies within a data centre, so to speak.

234
00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.960 
We liked that a lot.

235
00:23:52.960 --> 00:24:00.109 
And also so the whole jury that you could also develop a very sophisticated algorithm in the very short time,

236
00:24:00.109 --> 00:24:07.210 
that was able to illustrate how the work load shift can take place. And last but not least - State Secretary Schnur -

237
00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.599 
has already touched on this,

238
00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:15.400 
we were also very pleased that there was also a female participant in the team.

239
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.519 
Unfortunately, this is still somewhat underrepresented.

240
00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:26.440 
I think it's also a good sign that various teams are even more successful than when they were too homogeneous.

241
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.220 
designed.

242
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:36.589 
So that was the main reason of the jury - congratulations again for the prize and exactly that.

243
00:24:36.599 --> 00:25:06.789 
may I now present it to you!

244
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:07.349 
Have fun!

245
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:19.019 
Yes thank you very much Mr Albrecht, I had

246
00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:20.349 
not introduced you at all.

247
00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:32.690 
You are the director of the Government Relation Team of WMware in Germany. That was the Clean VM team. And now I have

248
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:46.670 
the Team CoYou writ large you on stage and ask Mr. Heitkötter, because that was a

249
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:47.849 
from SAP

250
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.950 
and appreciated, supported team.

251
00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:07.990 
You are the only one, so from diverse we have now moved to mini team - please introduce the winner exactly!

252
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:14.869 
Maybe let me just introduce the challenge first, this is the second one, so slightly different

253
00:26:14.869 --> 00:26:23.859 
than the challenge of the third place and I am happy to announce the first place here. We had set the challenge here

254
00:26:23.859 --> 00:26:32.589 
to develop a concept on how employees in companies can create transparency about their environmental impact, in particular

255
00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:41.970 
how they can be incentivised to also reduce their impact on the environment and how this can be achieved through software support.

256
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.630 
can be done.

257
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:51.369 
The winner here is a concept that aims to motivate employees, also from the companies, to become more involved in their work.

258
00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:57.579 
for the environment, to go through the day in a more environmentally conscious way. The team itself expressed too nicely:

259
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:05.900 
Clean IT starts with a sustainable mind set and how the whole thing can work, the team respectively

260
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:16.130 
Pascal as an individual, briefly introduce what you have developed. Yes, thank you very much, as I said,

261
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.779 
i approached this hackathon with my two teammates and so to the task to consider:

262
00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:21.160 
Okay,

263
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.680 
many companies, especially IT companies, in the last few years and the last few decades, hopefully always comes

264
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:35.549 
more and more, are committing to their digital footprint and with that, of course, also

265
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:41.210 
to their corporate responsibility towards the entire global environment.

266
00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:47.119 
And as we could see: There are wonderful concepts on how we can use digitalisation to make sustainability

267
00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:49.740 
by using a platform, as we have just seen,

268
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:56.390 
for example, or how we can make digitisation itself more sustainable with energy-focused scheduling(?)

269
00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:05.069 
algorithms. But regardless of how well a system or a product is ultimately developed and also how well it is

270
00:28:05.069 --> 00:28:05.829 
is planned.

271
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.210 
There is always a component that brings that decisive incentive.

272
00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:16.140 
That is still the human being and for that reason we have said or we are of the opinion:

273
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:24.009 
If a company or a department that also wants to build more and more sustainable products or the whole

274
00:28:24.009 --> 00:28:29.920 
development of it wants to make it more sustainable, more resource efficient,

275
00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:38.670 
cleaner however, then that has to be done by making the people who are building this product a cleaner, a more sustainable

276
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:46.019 
mindset and also promote it in the company. Of course, because ultimately every sustainable innovation starts

277
00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:47.500 
and every innovation in itself

278
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:54.329 
in somebody's head, in one of these employees. And to do that, we've developed an in-house platform that.

279
00:28:54.329 --> 00:29:03.140 
we have called COyou here, because "Saving CO2 starts with you" - once to the demo, please -

280
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:09.529 
exactly where employees can set themselves challenges, which in turn can be answered by other employees of this company.

281
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:10.900 
can be supported, so to speak.

282
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.950 
With an in-game currency that we called Sapling.

283
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:21.400 
That means I can set challenges myself, like I say for example: Konstantin, one of my teammates, said,

284
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:27.900 
he will off-set his flights for the whole of next year, whatever they produce.

285
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:33.789 
Then I can say okay, then I can say - does he have for projects then, because in the end it's always about that what's taken in, so to speak.

286
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:37.880 
is taken, these saplings, can be translated into a good cause in the end.

287
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:45.940 
That is, not only the action itself should serve a sustainable purpose, but also the result of what a company then sponsors.

288
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:51.180 
or invests in its employees. In other words, these saplings are, for example, periodically sponsored by the company.

289
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:56.299 
to the employees. They can then use them to create all of these challenges or tasks, to get

290
00:29:56.299 --> 00:30:03.049 
and then ultimately be used for good causes, whether it's offsetting flights or in some other way.

291
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:06.279 
way, for example, trees are planted.

292
00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:12.509 
In that case I would like to say: Constantine gets another ten Sapplingas from me for that through the portal. Then I can

293
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:20.279 
of course look at, ok which ones do I already support - now Konstantin has also appeared and I say, okay I think that's a super cool thing.

294
00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:24.539 
I would also like to win a few saplings like that and then spend them for a good cause.

295
00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:25.049 
to be able to.

296
00:30:25.059 --> 00:30:32.609 
And then say, for example, I can either create new challenges, tag them, which either sort of themselves

297
00:30:32.609 --> 00:30:38.109 
or I can also say well, I would like to explicitly challenge a colleague to do something and give them a tag.

298
00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:45.029 
or set up this challenge, which is then sponsored by others in turn.

299
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.549 
can be sponsored.

300
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:53.670 
If I look at okay, what did I do, for example I was vegan for ten days, I did for that

301
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:59.960 
now got 40 saplings and as proof of course I have to upload a photo, proof of some kind and

302
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.140 
way, so to speak, so that these can then be paid out.

303
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:11.420 
And this whole gamefication - it has to have a little incentive, of course, is: Ok on the one hand.

304
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:16.589 
I can look at how good I am, how much I have collected for companies. On the other hand

305
00:31:16.589 --> 00:31:20.430 
to see how I stand in my own team or how I stand in my own team.

306
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:26.109 
how does my whole team in the company actually compare with other teams? And there can be an incentive again

307
00:31:26.109 --> 00:31:32.029 
that the employer says: At the end of the year or at the end of the quarter, the team gets what it deserves.

308
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:41.369 
collected the most saplings or got sponsored, gets a team event and the like. One thing,

309
00:31:41.369 --> 00:31:45.849 
I didn't tell you right now is, I did a challenge myself while I was up there.

310
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:53.150 
because I would recommend to give a presentation about Climate Awareness and as a little proof I would like to take a photo now.

311
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:59.740 
of this,

312
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:14.759 
so that we can also submit these and I then also get my saplings - thank you very much!

313
00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:15.410 
Thank you very much!

314
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:22.880 
And again congratulations for the first place, as we all know everyone can contribute to climate protection and

315
00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:31.660 
CO2. Significant contributions are manifold, also in the private environment - heating, electricity, car, air travel.

316
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.349 
But we know it's sometimes not so easy to get motivated to do it.

317
00:32:35.349 --> 00:32:41.450 
And that was also one of the decisive reasons why the jury said: Yes, the team has a really great app concept.

318
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:47.859 
which has the potential to motivate and inspire employees to become more environmentally aware.

319
00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:54.410 
how they can also reduce their carbon footprint at work, but also in their private lives.

320
00:32:54.420 --> 00:33:03.190 
And yes, of course, the jury particularly liked the gamification approach, which has also just become clear.

321
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:11.150 
Your presentation was also very convincing on the day of the Challenge itself, now again of course, I think everyone saw that. The presentation

322
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:18.859 
of the app, also the demo, very good. Last but not least, of course, getting it all up and running in just 24 hours.

323
00:33:18.869 --> 00:33:21.660 
is a very great result.

324
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.549 


325
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:28.000 
The prototype is well developed, functional - also really impressive in terms of user experience.

326
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.759 
You can also see from this how much you were motivated by the topic, how much commitment you put into it.

327
00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:40.609 
So congratulations once again on your great achievements and yes we hope that we will also hear about such achievements in the future.

328
00:33:40.609 --> 00:33:42.549 
approaches in the future.

329
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:10.500 
So I would like to ask that all the teams now again that have won and also the jury members that are there, that

330
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:25.539 
sponsors who are there - all come forward for a picture together.

331
00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:29.239 
Come here.

hi my name is david lang. and today i'll be presenting joint

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.770 
work with my colleagues alex swain from the law address

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.920 
and mitchell stevens of stanford university.

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.460 
our work attempts to predict student major
as a function of early course selection.

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.850 
this might be useful for reducing a student's times for the green

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.680 
adequately providing the man courses and academically.

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.760 
it's interesting because it allows us to understand

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.160 
what types of courses are predicted nature

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.320 
and winston pathways fencer ossify and when major versions become sad.

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.880 
we focus on courses because they are ubiquitous feature about

11
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.790 
how colleges must keep track of this part of ferpa compliance

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.840 
past work has suggested that

13
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
courses both before and during a student's formative experience

14
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.240 
can inform what majors are going to select.

15
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.790 
however this work has been limited in that it tends to binary arise

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.210 
major in terms of style.

17
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.580 
recently there's been an innovation in combining natural language

18
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
methods to describe course pathways. this work has been used to

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.650 
generate unique course equivalencies course recommendations

20
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
and numerous other applications.

21
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.140 
we borrowed these methods

22
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.780 
for our own dataset which

23
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.640 
contains our more than twenty years of academic data from a selective private university.

24
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.970 
and we group our majors into the top twenty five categories

25
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.970 
of which comprise eighty four percent of students' majors.

26
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.350 
we represent courses through three unique strategies.

27
00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
the first of which is one-hot encoding
where each course is a dummy variable

28
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.010 
then quarter embeddings where we represent courses in terms

29
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.630 
of their co-occurrence with other courses in the academic corner.

30
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.340 
and finally academic career embeddings where we use represent

31
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.940 
courses in terms of their co-occurrence
within a student's entire academic history.

32
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.820 
we validate these embeddings by building a search
engines attack course prerequisites.

33
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.970 
so in a fact we compute cosine similarity between
these distinct representations.

34
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.590 
and let you look at their rank in a search engines identify

35
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.410 
their advocacy.

36
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.680 
we find that career embeddings are doing a much better job

37
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.510 
at detecting prerequisites than quarter embeddings in part.

38
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.160 
because students are unlikely to take a prerequisite and its dependent

39
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.290 
on the same quarter.

40
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.750 
we predict the student's major using a multinomial lasso,

41
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.830 
and we train and train it at various points in a student's

42
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.620 
academic progress ranging from one to sixty courses.

43
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.760 
our focal research questions are,
does the student's first course selection predict major?

44
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.110 
and second do different representation of courses
impact their predictive validity.

45
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.190 
we find that a first course

46
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.070 
does thirty times better than random guessing

47
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.210 
and that embedded representation not only produces more accurate results,

48
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.610 
but more diverse results in terms of our twenty five categories.

49
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.840 
this effect strengthens

50
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.000 
over time career embeddings outperform quarter embeddings and

51
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.310 
quarter embeddings outperform one-hot encodings.

52
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.840 
one-hot encoding is in fact ten to overfit
such that additional information

53
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.100 
actually makes performance worse.

54
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.890 
to recap early course selection can predict major quite well.

55
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.160 
and we find that the representation matters

56
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.210 
that embeddings can increase performance dramatically thank you.

1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.100 
Now we want to start to
discuss and consider

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.220 
various blockchain
alternatives in our openHPI

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.270 
course "Blockchain -
Revealing the Myth."

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.330 
I remind you to the definition of
first generation blockchain.

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.700 
You have it in mind - blockchain
technology provides a permissionless

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.680 
peer to peer network

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.260 
using proof of work to

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.870 
to record a public
history of contents

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.210 
and that quickly becomes computationally
impractical for an attacker

10
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.530 
to change it if honest nodes control
a majority of the CPU power.

11
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.800 
This was this proof of work approach,
as soon as the honest people

12
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.690 
have the majority of the computation
resources, this proof of works helps

13
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.740 
to provide a consensus between all the
users of the peer to peer network

14
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.930 
that have no
trust authority.

15
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.840 
This is done without a trust a trusted
third party does not require

16
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.310 
trust between the people
and it is based

17
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.440 
on the idea and the concept a is described
in the famous paper of Satoshi Nakamoto -

18
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.330 
"Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer
electronic cash system"

19
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.410 
from two thousand
and eight.

20
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.280 
The description of
the bitcoin system.

21
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.610 
But when we saw and already
discussed, when we discussed and

22
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.750 
introduced the
Ethereum system

23
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.100 
then we have to look for
a more efficient system

24
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.970 
that are applicable in the
different areas and when we look

25
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.480 
to the first generation,

26
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.470 
for examples the bitcoin system, then
really it provides permissionless

27
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.540 
public blockchain. Everyone can see
all transactions, everyone can

28
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.090 
can create blocks providing
the proof of work and others.

29
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.590 
So here in the original systems the
attention of restricting the terms

30
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.370 
in use is a way to make the
system more efficient.

31
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.610 
To restrict the number of people
that can create blocks, to restrict

32
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.500 
the number of people that can
see all the transactions.

33
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.510 
So we have and we'll discuss different
ways to increase the efficiency

34
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.010 
because it is a nice concept and
there are many applications that

35
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.430 
can be based on blockchain solutions. So
the decentralization of the system

36
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.580 
is a way if you see this, here for
example in this if there are some

37
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.030 
members in the network, some
peers in the network with more

38
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.090 
rights than the others,

39
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.390 
then the
decentralization

40
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:25.100 
becomes less important. So we will
see that one can have tradeoffs

41
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.590 
between decentralization and
security and efficiency and this

42
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.720 
is what we have done, what we learn when
we now look to the different variants

43
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.440 
of the blockchain.

44
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.430 
So let's start with a distinction
between private and public blockchains

45
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.170 
which comes from the
following restrictions -

46
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.860 
it is possible to
restrict the permission

47
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.050 
to read something from the users in
the blockchain peer-to-peer network.

48
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.680 
So not every user can
see every transaction

49
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.480 
so it is a possibility to
restrict the right permissions.

50
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.770 
Not everyone can write

51
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.310 
something or can create a
transaction or can create blocks.

52
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.430 
And then consensus
permissions.

53
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.300 
Who is allowed to vote
for the longest chain,

54
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.630 
who is able to
mine new blocks?

55
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.250 
So these are possibilities where
one can restrict the rights of the

56
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:41.500 
users of such a peer-to-peer network
with the idea to increase the

57
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.950 
efficiency, for example.

58
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.860 
So the public
blockchain

59
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.190 
is characterized by everyone,
may read and may write everything.

60
00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.940 
Private blockchain is characterized by
that, the read and the write permissions

61
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.330 
are limited to a certain
number of people.

62
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.860 
And then we have
permissionless networks.

63
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.710 
This is about the consensus permission.
Here in the permissionless

64
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.680 
original bitcoin blockchain, everyone
is allowed to vote, everyone

65
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.700 
is allowed to contribute to the
a consensus. So the public

66
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.860 
public blockchain
with a permissionless

67
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.840 
approach, this is the
original bitcoin system.

68
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.350 
But one can for several reason
also restrict the write and

69
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.390 
read permissions
and one can also

70
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.290 
restrict the number of people
that are able to vote, that are

71
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.000 
able to create blocks
and to vote for blocks.

72
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.280 
This here, this combination
typically is considered and named

73
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.930 
a private blockchain

74
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.680 
and this combination public and
permissionless is called a public

75
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.860 
blockchain and a public block
chain where everyone can see

76
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.970 
and write everything can also
be run with permissions, with

77
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.450 
a limited number of people that
are allowed to contribute to the

78
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.270 
consensus algorithm. Let's have a closer
look to the private blockchain.

79
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.280 
The restriction means that
users have to authenticate

80
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:41.450 
and authorize themself before
they can use the system. This is because

81
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.570 
the users have different rights.
So the system needs to decide

82
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.970 
who is allowed
to do what.

83
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.160 
So here there
is no need

84
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.920 
for such kind of application,
no need in transparency

85
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.150 
of the content for all. So for example
it's no more necessary that everyone

86
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.300 
sees every transaction and also
the voting on the next block,

87
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.830 
by proof of work or by another
consensus algorithm can be done

88
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.430 
with more efficient strategies than
with proof of work. This is a

89
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.840 
key fact for making the decision to
work with a private blockchain,

90
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.820 
this proof of
work which is

91
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.500 
which is very costly, which
is very energy intensive

92
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.360 
this can be
reduced to a number

93
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.130 
of people or it can
be replaced

94
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.750 
by other consensus algorithms
so that the miners

95
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:55.450 
become validaters in this. The
risk here is that these pre-selected miners

96
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.930 
and validaters, they can more easily
be attacked by the attackers

97
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.820 
by the malicious users because is
exactly known who are the people

98
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.440 
which have more rights and
the others have to trust them.

99
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.940 
Let's have a view on the proof
of work in consensus algorithms.

100
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.350 
This was what we have introduced when
we considered the bitcoin system.

101
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.820 
The question why we should
think about other ways

102
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.870 
to provide a consensus, to create
the truth that's accepted by all

103
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.950 
the peers in a peer-to-peer
network that do not trust each other.

104
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.620 
So the reason is among the most
widespread headlines

105
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:51.730 
about blockchain technology
is the energy consumption.

106
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.500 
The energy consumption
of the bitcoin system,

107
00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.440 
it's a huge amount of energy that is
needed to run the bitcoin system.

108
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.680 
So analyzed energy
consumption

109
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.970 
is equivalent to the energy that is

110
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.220 
needed in a state
like Chile.

111
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:18.300 
So the carbon footprint of a single
transaction equivalent is equivalent to

112
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:24.710 
seven hundred to seven hundred twenty
five thousand visa transactions.

113
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.380 
So in visa transactions, we have a trusted
third party. If we work without it in

114
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.190 
bitcoin and blockchain then
we have to pay with energy.

115
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:43.290 
Also, surprisingly bitcoin influences
the energy that it spent on mining

116
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.560 
and here we see the amount,
the energy that amount that

117
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.440 
is needed for the
bitcoin proof of work

118
00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:00.520 
approach to provide consensus.
Another consensus algorithm is

119
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.410 
based on a proof
of authority.

120
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.830 
This is an alternative
to the proof of work

121
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.570 
for permissioned blockchains.
This is called proof of authority

122
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:18.250 
and is no longer based on the huge
amount of works that needs to be done

123
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.900 
to find a consensus. The idea behind this
is that there is a limited group of users

124
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.480 
that are allowed to participate
in the consensus algorithm,

125
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:35.350 
that are allowed to create a
new block, that are allowed to

126
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.220 
vote about the chain
and others. And then we

127
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.390 
think about that concept and
if we limit the group to one

128
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.610 
member, to one node,

129
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.470 
then we have our
traditional bank

130
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:57.680 
environment. All the users have to trust
is this one group here in that case

131
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.130 
it is a limited group. So
it's not only one party.

132
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.080 
But the principle that
the other nodes

133
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.960 
which are not allowed to vote they
need to trust

134
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.260 
that group. This

135
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:20.020 
blockchain, this Proof-of-Authority
consensus are also called consortium

136
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.220 
blockchain. The group is called
the consortium and it's clear

137
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.520 
the smaller the group

138
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.170 
the more simple
is it to

139
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.220 
get a majority
vote which

140
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.780 
increases the efficiency
of the system.

141
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:43.360 
But, at the same time the risk is increasing,
the risk that attackers manipulate

142
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:52.390 
by the selected nodes the consensus

143
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.540 
in our network.

144
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.880 
There is a third alternative
that is, for example,

145
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.080 
used in many blockchain
solutions. That's the proof of stake

146
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.950 
approach. This is also an alternative to
the proof of work. Therefore public

147
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.740 
unpermissioned block
chains, it is called

148
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.640 
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because it
relies on the stakes

149
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.290 
of proportion of digital
coins in a cryptocurrency.

150
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.510 
So if a user, the
stake of a user

151
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.770 
depends from the amount
of digital coins he owns.

152
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:41.430 
If the user has n percent of
digital coins, then he may create

153
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.440 
n percent of
the blocks.

154
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:50.010 
Here in that approach, the
miners are replaced by validators

155
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:54.850 
which use a proof of stake algorithm
and have the possibility

156
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.560 
to create a block
and the chain.

157
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.760 
Question - is it still blockchain
to work with other consensus?

158
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:10.290 
So, many new independent blockchain networks
with adapted parameters or new functionalities

159
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:15.720 
are created. Some are created using
the bitcoin or the Ethereum

160
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.290 
source code. So the
people modify the way

161
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.860 
the consensus is provided, they play
with the permissions that are given

162
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.360 
and the question when

163
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.220 
it is a blockchain and when is
no more blockchains solution.

164
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.460 
So numerous technical concepts and
projects which already existed

165
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:44.590 
before blockchain technology simply
uses the hype around blockchain

166
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.660 
and called their solutions
blockchain solutions

167
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:54.290 
simply to make more business
and to exceed higher

168
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.570 
sales on the market

169
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.190 
under the block
chain name.

170
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:05.320 
So the question arises as to which
changes and adaptions would be they

171
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.440 
that's no longer a blockchain
based solution? We will discuss

172
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.810 
and consider these questions

173
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:20.130 
in the following clips when we consider
different alternatives, different modifications

174
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.210 
and when we ask ourselves
what kind of application

175
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.260 
these blockchain variants
are useful to choose.

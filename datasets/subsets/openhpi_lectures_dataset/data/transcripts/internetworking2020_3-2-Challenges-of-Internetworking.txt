00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.760 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.850 
we want to have a closer look on the
challenges of internetworking now.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.010 
You remember internetworking, this
was a concept of connecting

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.990 
heterogenous computer networks into
a uniform communication system.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550 
But we cannot simply interconnect
the different network technologies

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.110 
because they are incompatible,
they differ in transmission

7
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
media that are used, they differ
in the access control, they

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.740 
differ in the formats for addresses
and data packets they are using,

9
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.240 
as there are various performance indicators,
error handling mechanisms are different.

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
So simply to interconnect the
networks does not work.

11
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.810 
So we have to provide

12
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.040 
a complete new
network level.

13
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.250 
It starts with that each host in the
internet require its own unique address.

14
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.090 
Of course in of course is each
host in a computer network has

15
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.370 
its own address in the technology
of this network, but

16
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.530 
this uniqueness inside one network for
such kind of address is not guaranteed

17
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.690 
within other networks. So we need a
new scheme to describe addresses

18
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.000 
and we have to give each of the
hosts in this interconnected world

19
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.060 
an own IP address.

20
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.760 
When we want to send an information
from one computer to another

21
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.100 
in this interconnected
networks in the internet

22
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.230 
then we need to address a computer.
We have to exactly tell the system

23
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.560 
I want to send this message to
this computer in the internet.

24
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.680 
For example with
this IP address

25
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:17.780 
244.79.248.217. You see each of the
hosts get such an IP address.

26
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.780 
You see each of the hosts
get such an IP address.

27
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.050 
This, important is this address
internet address is globally unique

28
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.850 
and to reach this in
an efficient way

29
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.850 
to reach this in
an efficient way

30
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.480 
the addresses are hierarchically
organized. We will have later

31
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.580 
on a closer look.

32
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.120 
Here we want to address the different
tasks that need to be done to let

33
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.510 
internetworking work.

34
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.530 
So the transmission path through
this network of networks.

35
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.810 
So we want to send
a message from

36
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.990 
from our computer to
receiver address.

37
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.650 
We can address this other computers
but we have to do this over a series

38
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.130 
of intermediate systems. Reason
is that inside the network we

39
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.400 
can reach all the computers, but
then to reach computers in other

40
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.160 
connected networks we have to send the
data over these intermediate systems.

41
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:31.640 
So the way which such a system such a
packet is going through the internet

42
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.290 
is called a route, and the route
is not determined by the sender.

43
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.130 
The sender does not know the structure
of this interconnected network.

44
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.480 
The route is determined by the
single intermediate systems

45
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.040 
on the path of the
data package.

46
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.540 
Each of these routers

47
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.490 
determines the next hop the next transmission
to the next intermediate systems.

48
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.200 
This way of course through a
network computer network but

49
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.880 
to connect to the other networks there is
another intermediate system, another router

50
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.230 
which have to be addressed by on
this determining this route

51
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.880 
as a package goes who's
in the network.

52
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.390 
Next point we have to provide
solutions is the transmission

53
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.220 
principle for the packets. We
speak of packet switching

54
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.500 
and the problem is that the different
networks which are connected

55
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.430 
often are not able to not able
to send a large message.

56
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.650 
For that reason the large message is
broken down into small data packets

57
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.790 
and then this small data packets
are sent through the network

58
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.340 
each on its own way. So not
the message as in all

59
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.610 
but the fragments of the message are
transported through the internet

60
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.960 
and individually they reach the
receiver and then the receiver

61
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.110 
needs to be able to restructure
the complete message.

62
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.210 
Otherwise he didn't
understand the message,

63
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.930 
so we have to provide
solution for this way.

64
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.920 
Next point is the error
free transmission.

65
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.610 
Each of the networks
has own error

66
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.780 
technologies to recognize
and to repair errors.

67
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.780 
Here in our example I show it again,
one of the package got lost

68
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.120 
or got damaged. So we have
to provide a mechanism

69
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.970 
that the receiver can detect that
some part of the message is missing

70
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.600 
and that the receiver or
together with sender can ask

71
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.320 
for example for retransmission
of the lost packet or if a

72
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.770 
package reach it the system in a
damaged form, eventually to repair

73
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.710 
this data package.

74
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.730 
So here this is a very important
principle in the internet

75
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.750 
organised on the TCP level is the
retransmission of damaged or lost packages.

76
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.760 
These are challenges of
inter-networking and in the following

77
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.410 
clips we will discuss each
of the challenges and will

78
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.050 
tell you and discuss with you the
solution to the challenges.

79
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.050 
tell you and discuss with you the
solution to the challenges.

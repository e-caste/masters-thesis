00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.760 
Welcome everyone, to the first clean-IT open exchange life

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.220 
talk. My name is Nils König and i'm here today with Max Plauth,

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.060 
we are both members of the

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.660 
HPI student sustainability club and the clean-IT team at the HPI

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.170 
and we're going to moderate this live talk today.

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.740 
With us today as our first guest is professor doctor Christoph

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.230 
Meinel, director of the Hasso Plattner Institute and vice-dean of

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.490 
the digital Engineering Faculty of the University of Potsdam.

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.010 
Professor Meinel started the clean-IT initiative last year

10
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.860 
at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Soon after that the clean-IT

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820 
forum was founded where ideas and solutions for more

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.790 
sustainable digitilization can be shared and discussed.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.740 
The clean-IT forum is a massive open online course on openHPI

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.270 
which is free and open for everyone,

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.840 
and today we will start the first episode of clean-IT open

16
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.980 
exchange which is a series of live talks and discussions.

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
Professor Meinel as our first guest is here today to explain

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.440 
what the clean-IT initiative is all about and why it was founded.

19
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.370 
Welcome, professor Meinel.

20
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.190 
Thank you Nils, thank you Maximilen also Maxime Azuma for starting this

21
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.980 
clean-IT open

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.040 
exchange forum.

23
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.560 
We have a lot of activities in the Hasso Plattner

24
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.620 
institute, in the various research groups

25
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.600 
dealing with the question whether when we design IT systems,

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.690 
when we design a complex software system

27
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.580 
or whether it's possible also to have climatization aspect in mind..

28
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.900 
I tried to change..

29
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.980 
Sorry, it seems to be frozen.. only slow.

30
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.840 
This is our times which are characterized by the additional

31
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.680 
transformation in society, in the economics, in the education, all things

32
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.210 
and here we are not really understanding what's going on. We are

33
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.050 
active doing, we are surprised

34
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.970 
what happens and so a digital transformation is present and we have

35
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.200 
to deal with it.

36
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.850 
When we speak about climate, the climate is one of

37
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.850 
a large group of global

38
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.060 
sustainability development goals. There are seventeen and

39
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.260 
then we look for the role of digitalisation, then we see almost each of these

40
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.140 
SDGs can be pushed, can be

41
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.140 
brought forward by digital technologies,

42
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.730 
whether it's health, whether it's education, whether it's work.

43
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.690 
In all as this part

44
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.610 
it is unimaginable to reach these goals without using digital technologies.

45
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.520 
We in HPI, we tried to

46
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.840 
understand our position,

47
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.270 
our standing with respect to sustainable development goals and

48
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.240 
open this dashboard which shows our activities in teaching,

49
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.670 
research, partnership and others so that everyone who is interested

50
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.180 
can see what we are doing and

51
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.150 
more important he also can start our own activities, so it is

52
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.160 
actualized every time.

53
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.590 
But when we discuss digital technologies then

54
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.950 
we see also the problem that digital technologies need a lot of power

55
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.690 
so they are digital technologies are responsible for

56
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.520 
global carbon emission in a large extent.

57
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.790 
On the one side digitalisation bring solutions to the sustainability

58
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.810 
goals and on the other side its a problem,

59
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.840 
and exactly this is what we want to discuss and what we want to address

60
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.700 
with our clean-IT initiative.

61
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.350 
So the digital technologies will decrease carbon, have the power

62
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.100 
to decrease carbon emissions in many

63
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.150 
other sectors but the technology itself is, the carbon

64
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.300 
emissions need to be reduced.

65
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.760 
To give only a few figures, if you look for the

66
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.510 
carbon footprint of air traffic, worldwide air traffic before Corona crisis

67
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.750 
as then there was about one billion carbons each year

68
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.290 
and when we compare it to the

69
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.420 
carbon that's produced by

70
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.030 
IT systems, IT technologies then it's double

71
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.520 
so it's four percent of the emissions are

72
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.750 
coming from the use of

73
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.090 
computing centres, the use of smart devices,the use of web

74
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.520 
technologies, streaming and others. So, we have really

75
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.830 
to think seriously about these problems

76
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.140 
and there are a lot of things to imagine what it means so if

77
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.870 
we look to the first AI deep learning models

78
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.100 
and the extensive training that's necessary, for example, to teach them

79
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.520 
to understand images then there are more study from MIT which says

80
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.900 
to completely train such an AI model

81
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.630 
needs and produce.. needs the same amount of energy and produce the same

82
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.430 
amount of carbon, like three hundred round trips between San-Francisko

83
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.860 
and New York or the same amount of energy in carbon production like

84
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.090 
five car life cycles.

85
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.250 
So, really, we have to think and if you are think, for example,

86
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:54.030 
for other digital technologies like Bitcoin, Bitcoing mining, it's a huge

87
00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.620 
energy block. So, Hasso Plattner's Vision of HPI as the University

88
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.750 
Excellence Center for Digital Engineering also have

89
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.550 
to take into account these problematic side of the IT,

90
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.210 
of the use of IT technologies. This was reason that we

91
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.850 
started in two thousand and twenty in a Davos

92
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.520 
from HPI initiated a clean-IT initiative, we did it together with Parmas,

93
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.770 
we signed the UN Global Compact

94
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.340 
contract, we launched various clean-IT

95
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.160 
initiatives and looked around in HPI

96
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.500 
and in the research institute of Palmas of research activities

97
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.010 
which are dealing and focus on energy efficient

98
00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:00.330 
development design of IT system, of software systems and AI algorithms.

99
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.980 
Though there are different facets,

100
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:12.540 
the raising awareness of the digital carbon footprint to software systems.

101
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.860 
The hardware designers, the companies producing

102
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:25.350 
hardware chips and computers they are very much aware of this energy

103
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.120 
side of their systems because energy in hardware

104
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:38.420 
produces heat and it's so difficult to bring the heat away from the systems

105
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:44.820 
so they for a long time are very careful in using energy resources

106
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:51.900 
and very much focused on the efficient use of energy in the software design

107
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.730 
and with the programmer there is no immediate feedback

108
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.520 
which tells us whether the designed system is

109
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.380 
more or less energy efficient.

110
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.950 
So, in the software design it's a more abstract point of view

111
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.350 
and though it is very much important to help the people to understand

112
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:22.360 
that designing, developing, programming, configuring

113
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.900 
large IT systems then it is very important to have this energy aspect

114
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:35.010 
in mind so what we think and what we know from the security

115
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.210 
area that we propagate today, we have to

116
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.340 
design systems which security by design not designing a

117
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.670 
system and afterward looking how we can

118
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.840 
secure, how we can solve security questions. The same must be true here

119
00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:01.630 
in this aspect of energy need of system, so sustainability by design

120
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.040 
in education, in design of the system, this is our goal.

121
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.660 
And the major challenge

122
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.330 
in engineering is the optimisation of energy efficiency

123
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:20.600 
of algorithms, of programs, of AI models, of IT systems.

124
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.790 
We can solve the same problem with different algorithms and

125
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.660 
typically it is considered how fast is an algorithm, how much

126
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:39.940 
resources it needs, we should also look and ask what about the energy efficiency

127
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:46.940 
of such algorithms. The programs implementing the same algorithm

128
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.060 
can vary in their energy efficiency, although the programmers

129
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.370 
have to seeing and have to be aware

130
00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:03.040 
that their work is important, it is influencing the energy need

131
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.490 
of the systems and then we have to play with

132
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.470 
different things, we can discuss trade-offs

133
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:18.410 
with between a currency, speed, memory size, energy efficiency

134
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:24.920 
to design optimal systems with regard to the IT

135
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.820 
aspects but also with regard to the climatization aspect.

136
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:36.380 
I want to give one example as from

137
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.330 
our research group here in HPI.

138
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:48.110 
In HPI we have a group of six to eight people working on AI

139
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:56.830 
questions, designing AI models and what we try to do in particular with this aspect

140
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.130 
climatization to work with binary neural networks.

141
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.510 
So state of the art deep neural networks with thirty two bit architectures

142
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:13.040 
and already showed that the training of deep neural networks

143
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:19.800 
is very energy consuming, though our hope is if we are able to replace

144
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.170 
thirty two bit models by one bit models

145
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:30.500 
and if we reach similar accuracy, then we can reduce

146
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.160 
by many effectors we can reduce energy,

147
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.940 
so what we see and we are

148
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.890 
see good in immediate results that on a binary level are that we

149
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.530 
save sixty four times of computing operations and therefore

150
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.710 
more than ninety five percent of energy

151
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:59.610 
by.. in the moment we lose about five percent position,

152
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.930 
so of course we have to improve this,

153
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.820 
but we are encouraged by this work that it's possible

154
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:14.140 
also to think as an optimization criteria for such AI models also

155
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.820 
on the energy but this is just the beginning, there are many

156
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.720 
steps and many research groups in HPI are trying today so if you see

157
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.520 
the next gen data storage algorithms, in data centers, in the

158
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.510 
cloud, there is a huge potential of saving energy.

159
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.100 
If one thinks on streaming algorithms and knows that streaming

160
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:44.290 
becomes more and more popular, one has to think about new streaming algorithms

161
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.220 
which are more energy efficient,

162
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.550 
new methods to bring online information

163
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.240 
to the users in a much more

164
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.410 
energy efficient way.

165
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.700 
Same is true for Blockchain.

166
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.390 
In Blockchain, in the moment we see that proof

167
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.950 
of power that is cannot be a solution

168
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.360 
because then Blockchain technology would need a huge amount

169
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.790 
of energy so we have to think on other consensus

170
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:29.070 
algorithms which are less energy needed and then of

171
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.140 
course if you think on IOT systems, internet of things,

172
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.860 
we are more and more in our flats, in our family poles, in our

173
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:47.950 
institutions, IT systems regulate the work and help us with

174
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.340 
accessing information whenever we need, that

175
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:58.940 
designing such systems we have to put into our consideration that this

176
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:07.460 
is also not contributing to global warming, that we have a responsibility

177
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:14.380 
as designers, as IT engineers to think about moral energy efficient systems.

178
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.750 
Of course, as an HPI, as an university institute we cannot do this alone,

179
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.280 
we can sustainabilise

180
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:29.590 
in the education, our students, so we are happy that our students

181
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.450 
cooperate particular on this point.

182
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:40.160 
They has this event,this series of events is organized by the students of our sustainability club,

183
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.540 
thank you very much for this, but also we need international organizations

184
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.910 
in particular for developing standards, which

185
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.850 
support energy efficient system. We are in close relation with

186
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:01.450 
IEEE, its the biggest, largest international organization in that point.

187
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.380 
We are in discussion with politics, with Industry partners, with Academia,

188
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:13.540 
with NGOs and our serious and our open HPI activity

189
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.660 
should help to bring this

190
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.790 
to a larger awareness and to bring us forward in thinking this

191
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:29.830 
so the HPI clean-IT forum on openHPI.de so it helps to share ideas

192
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:37.610 
how IT systems could be designed more energy efficient that we invite everyone

193
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:44.100 
to contribute with their own best practice cases, their own ideas

194
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.140 
from research, from application and so feel free

195
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:54.990 
to join us in this point. Thank you for your interest and I am

196
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.960 
open for discussion.

197
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.720 
Thank you very much professor Meinel for your presentation and

198
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.920 
for your introduction into the clean-IT initiative and into

199
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.450 
the clean-IT forum at the end.

200
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.040 
We will now proceed to the Q and A session. If you have any questions please either

201
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.760 
write them in the chat or we will also allow everyone to unmute

202
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.550 
themselves now but please if you want to ask any questions

203
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.850 
we want to ask you to first raise your hand so that we can

204
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.740 
pick one after the other and we don't talk into each other.

205
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.950 
As a first question, as some people might still be thinking about,

206
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.260 
there are questions.. I want to ask one question to you, professor Meinel:

207
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.480 
"Sustainability has been an important point, an important

208
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.920 
topic for a while now. What was the motivation to start the

209
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.010 
clean-IT initiative now or last year? Was there a certain

210
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.950 
event that led to this decision or was it a longer process? Was it

211
00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.660 
already planned for a longer time?".

212
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.070 
It is, I think, a various discussions. In the years two thousand

213
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.120 
and eighteen, two thousand and nineteen there was characterized by the

214
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.090 
big success of AI systems and the

215
00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:18.330 
demand to rule it out, to bring it industry, to a broad scale,

216
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.430 
similar with a blockchain technology and same time people working

217
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.330 
on the topic became aware, that's really

218
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.870 
huge energy needed to run this systems and

219
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.350 
there was the beginning of a discussion

220
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:44.850 
whether IT is a solution for the sustainability goals or

221
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.110 
whether it's a problem and

222
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:54.090 
of course we as IT engineers, researchers in digitalization we

223
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.050 
want to see it as an enabler, as a problem solver

224
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.130 
and for that reason we need to be

225
00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.470 
also responsible on the bad sides of

226
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:15.200 
digitalisation and this is energy need and its a carbon footprint

227
00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:20.410 
so as this was many discussions there was no single event but

228
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.460 
we thought, when this discussion become more and more popular

229
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.720 
it is important that from a side of

230
00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:36.450 
IT people, we are prepared to try to answer these question, because

231
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.570 
I do not believe that less digitalisation helps

232
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.870 
in all aspects we need more digitalisation

233
00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:54.540 
but we can only propagate this if we find solutions, if we also think

234
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.940 
that how we can reduce a carbon footprint.

235
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.440 
Thank you, there has been a first question in the chat now.

236
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.010 
"What interest would industry have when having five percent

237
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.650 
less accuracy in their algorithm results?". So, I think, the question aims at

238
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.860 
why or what is what should be the motivation for industry and

239
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:23.520 
and industry actors to reduce the emissions when they sacrifice their

240
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.450 
results for that?

241
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:32.460 
To make it clear, this five percent are an intermediate result that our

242
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:37.680 
research with the AI models is a binary AI models is about

243
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.840 
five percent less accuracy than with the best..

244
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.130 
so the two bit architectures, so it cannot be

245
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.530 
the end of the discussion or we have to

246
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.780 
improve our research for it.

247
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.560 
There are many things we can play with..

248
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.410 
You know from the

249
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:11.120 
introductory, the courses in IT education from efficient algorithms, from

250
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.780 
the computer science said that

251
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:26.190 
algorithms can be run very precisely that we have rounding effects

252
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.580 
computing with numbers that we can raise the efficiency of

253
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.630 
algorithms, when we use probabilistic methods, when we

254
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:42.090 
work with approximation algorithms and others so there is a toured case

255
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.810 
of different approaches that need to be combined.

256
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.880 
It is clear that we cannot propagate

257
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.540 
worse results than its possible, we have to provide to industry

258
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.350 
and applications the best results that possible

259
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.470 
with the lowest energy

260
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:08.960 
need, so this was a work in progress and of course we cannot

261
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.710 
propagate to say

262
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.830 
please now use only the binary AI

263
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.980 
models because we want to reduce the energy need, we have to improve the

264
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:27.270 
binary approaches to get at the end same results

265
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:33.550 
that like the other. We have speaking about AI.. in the moment

266
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.520 
we have the situation that in the research institutions

267
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.990 
there is a lot of research work

268
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.840 
and what we now try to see where are the boundaries, what can

269
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.430 
be reached with AI methods

270
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.830 
but industry is coming

271
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:55.640 
shortly behind research and as we have to apply this method in our offering

272
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.940 
and applying such AI methods by industry

273
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:06.130 
is an exploding enrollment. In the research institutions there are a few

274
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:11.650 
but the industrial applications they are run by millions of people

275
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:17.290 
so from the research we have to learn that we need also systems with high energy

276
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.010 
need but we have into research to decrease

277
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:29.650 
this like we try to improve the accuracy of such models.

278
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.030 
There have been a few more questions in the chat

279
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.990 
now already and it's a few long ones actually.

280
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.590 
I will read out the text and then the question first: "Oriented

281
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.840 
digital technologies have to be promoted and as the course

282
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.350 
clean-IT showed there are many promising approaches to do so

283
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.480 
on the other hand the energy consumption of the modern world

284
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.700 
cannot be filled sufficiently with wind and solar technology.

285
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.820 
In Germany and especially around Germany small secure and efficient

286
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.120 
nuclear power plants are discussed intensively.

287
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.140 
In Germany we have EG the dual fluid reactor technology.

288
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.420 
How do you see the future of the energy production technologies

289
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.610 
in Germany and Europe

290
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.150 
to have enough electrical energy for all industrial

291
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.790 
areas and also digitalisation?".

292
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.520 
We have many different points to start with research.

293
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.180 
What we with a clean-IT initiative

294
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:34.920 
like to promote us to bring, to make the designers of IT systems,

295
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:36.960 
programmers,

296
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:45.770 
to more awareness that their work, the programs they design, the systems they design

297
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.860 
use, when they are later on applied, use a lot of energy.

298
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:57.370 
There are other sectors how we can produce energy more efficiently

299
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.520 
as there are different also in research, different research

300
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:07.010 
activities, one was mentioned in this questions, there are many more,

301
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:14.160 
of course, we like to see this but what we say, we as

302
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.100 
digital engineers we cannot wait

303
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.660 
that there are better production, better..

304
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.530 
more climate saving energy production's in place,

305
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.320 
we have to start now with our activities

306
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:37.720 
and even when in a future situation, the production situation of energy

307
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.940 
is better, with respect to the climate and climate

308
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:51.930 
billions.. it is important that IT system run as energy efficient as possible,

309
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.540 
so I welcome all kind of research which

310
00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.390 
brings also new ideas

311
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:04.910 
into practice to improve the way how we produce energy, the

312
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:10.930 
way how we use energy and there are no dogma alowed,

313
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.100 
we have to use any chance and have to follow any idea

314
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.320 
that seems to be helpful,

315
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:26.880 
to proof of whether this idea really can come to a practical application,

316
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.160 
that is part of a research path.

317
00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.350 
And there was yet another question common to the AI topic:

318
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.190 
"In terms of AI developing algorithms is only the first step,

319
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.410 
deploying a, model integrating it in an AI system, monitoring

320
00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.990 
and running it over a certain period of time, when doing

321
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.730 
so, it is challenging to foresee the carbon footprints whilst measuring an

322
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.090 
energy consumption and IT is not standardised yet. So, how do you think

323
00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.330 
how big is the impact of not just training it but deploying

324
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.480 
it and then later monitoring it and what could be done to

325
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.430 
decrease the energy consumption of that parts?".

326
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.650 
So, when I shortly mentioned our research work

327
00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.610 
with a binary AI models,

328
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.120 
of course, one idea is to reduce energy, the other is to allow

329
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.280 
to run such models on small systems,

330
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.740 
on smartphones, for example,

331
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:35.240 
and in that way to reduce energy on another way not running

332
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.330 
it in a cloud and then bringing the results back

333
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:45.480 
but eventually make it possible to run the AI models

334
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.640 
inside of a smartphone and coming and bringing the results

335
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.500 
that are desired.

336
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.590 
The next question is: "Whether there are any

337
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.190 
kind of plans in IT to suggest an energy label or something

338
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.860 
similar for software?". And I can, I think, partly answer that question already,

339
00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:11.740 
So in Germany there's the BlueAngel for software is already planned,

340
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.090 
I think it hasn't been

341
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:19.380 
deployed or it hasn't been put on to any software yet but there

342
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.910 
is research into that direction. Do you have knowledge of any other labeling

343
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.930 
methods or so for software?

344
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.490 
Any such kind of initiative is very common and need to be done.

345
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:37.150 
There is a problem when we look to the energy need of software assistance.

346
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:43.140 
It is difficult to measure, so modern and complex system run on

347
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.610 
cloud structures distributed in the world,

348
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.010 
so it's really, in research,

349
00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.030 
research question itself, how to measure this and of course

350
00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:01.320 
to measure it is a pre-request to be able to compare with other approaches.

351
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.930 
So, we have a

352
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:10.660 
very big problem in measuring the energy

353
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.440 
need of systems we are designing

354
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:19.990 
and for me it's an explanation that in the past, the software designer

355
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.000 
didn't care so much about this question,

356
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:28.500 
indifferent to the hardware designer, they all the years

357
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.790 
look very carefully to this point, I mentioned this, because

358
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.610 
the bad side of energy use

359
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.940 
is heat production and this is difficult for the systems

360
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.810 
as they have to bring it out but for the software, the software designer,

361
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:49.950 
the programmer does not see the effect immediately, he makes some

362
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:56.190 
into the development on his machine or in his environment but then, later on,

363
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.980 
the system is deployed from

364
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.950 
cloud infrastructure practice around the world then

365
00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.620 
he or she cannot see

366
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.650 
whether it's more or less energy efficient so it would be great

367
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.940 
to have such a labour but it's very difficult to define it.

368
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.610 
Yeah, that's certainly true and another question from Max is:

369
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.490 
"In order to improve energy efficiency of software

370
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:28.190 
isn't the trend of moving away from the metal towards highly abstract

371
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.840 
programming frameworks, EG for machine learning use cases counter-productive

372
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.630 
so shouldn't we stay on low level programming frameworks?"

373
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:45.680 
This is a typical experience. You every

374
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.050 
have to work with the best technology at hand,

375
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:57.140 
so to restrict, to forbid some technologies or to restrict and

376
00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.870 
saying we are doing only this way, that typically

377
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:09.550 
it does not fit to the openness of research. We have to get progress

378
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.920 
and we have to use any possibility that's possible to reach

379
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.720 
this progress, there's also a kind of competition around as

380
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.830 
there are different approaches and after a while

381
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.920 
one sees this approach is more powerful as less powerful since

382
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.110 
approach has advantages in this applications,

383
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.710 
the other approach has advantages in others, so I would stay open

384
00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.140 
but carefully looking at the results.

385
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.680 
So, I think that have been most questions out of the chat.

386
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.940 
I have one more question, maybe for the finish.

387
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.920 
The ideas presented in clean-IT forum are mostly on a

388
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.950 
technological basis and you already talked about today about

389
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.620 
that measures have to be taken together and in combined in

390
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.730 
order to really work well and so my question is:" in your mind,

391
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.670 
what are the most important political measures that should

392
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:15.250 
be taken to make digitalisation more sustainable in combination with these

393
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.000 
technological advances?".

394
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.120 
Not easy question because it depends from the country and the special situation in the

395
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.080 
country. We, in Germany, have with all

396
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.930 
aspects of digitalisation problems with our governance model,

397
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.100 
with our federal governance model,

398
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:42.340 
for example, we when we developed the SchulCloud we could realise

399
00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.060 
what is the problem in that area.

400
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:50.310 
In Germany, for the schools responsible is the lowest level,

401
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:57.930 
see the commune and the others and they pay for the computer and so

402
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.910 
they are asked also to take care for digitalisation.

403
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.800 
It's completely impossible the situation in the gesundheitsamt

404
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.640 
choses because it needs a common approach

405
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.790 
for all, we need something like an

406
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.120 
electric systems where

407
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:23.890 
on each place I can get energy in the same amount, in the same standarts.

408
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.210 
Eventually, let's compare this autobahn. This autobahn and

409
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:35.510 
which reach the last village but which reach them in the same standarts.

410
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:41.570 
So, here this needs to be learned in Germany, this is the biggest in my

411
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.160 
experience, the biggest hören in

412
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.530 
reaching progress in digitalisation,

413
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.680 
in the state administration,

414
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.080 
in the interaction betweet people,

415
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:01.120 
between state and citizens. The industry

416
00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.190 
they are responsible and of course the global

417
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.440 
companies they work well indeed.

418
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:13.910 
The global companies we think awareness

419
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:19.160 
initiatives should be done, so we are happy

420
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.670 
about the partnership with SAP

421
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.350 
because when we do something in research

422
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.370 
they are doing it on a really broad scale,

423
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:37.290 
so when we in some can save some small amount in our research

424
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.760 
systems some small amount of energy when they

425
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.110 
applie this in developing their systems which are run million times,

426
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.340 
then from the small effect we get a big

427
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.580 
effect and this is

428
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:59.210 
important to reach with ideas see as digital companies, the global companies,

429
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.890 
in the moment they are dealing with the energy around us,

430
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:08.140 
they want to all have a say in which year, say..

431
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.410 
only use clean-IT but

432
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.710 
I do not hear so much initiatives like the clean-IT initiative,

433
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:24.020 
speaking about how the systems are designed in a way that they

434
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.210 
are more energy efficient able to work.

435
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.570 
Well, I think there's one more last question in the chat,

436
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:37.130 
maybe its a short question. As you already mentioned by local calculations, edge computing

437
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.260 
especially also in the field of IOT can help to reduce energy

438
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.380 
this makes microcontrollers and microelectronics very necessary.

439
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.680 
How do you judge the European and especially also the German

440
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.420 
competencies to compete with Asian and American companies?

441
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.440 
In the research world

442
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.180 
I think we are completely

443
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.980 
competetive and can

444
00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.540 
work and look at the same level with the researchers around the world.

445
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.850 
In Germany, often we have a problem with

446
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.610 
implementation of the research results in the broad exist.

447
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:24.510 
Speaking about that, we have a big advantages because of the industry,

448
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.670 
of the manufacturing industry and also car producers, our manufacturing industry,

449
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:37.010 
that we with such small chips and devises

450
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.480 
can implement the vision industry for all

451
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:52.030 
and I think here we are worldwide leading also in as a digital activity is

452
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.620 
collecting data, analyzing big data,

453
00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.450 
interaction with the people, providing them

454
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:06.920 
information around the world, here we are a weak or so as a problem is

455
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.160 
we have own regulation, for example, for data protection

456
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.760 
but we have no own infrastructures

457
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:19.530 
to lift these data protection rules. Here,

458
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.380 
the politics has to take action,

459
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:29.490 
like say start a large initiative for quantum computing, they

460
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.450 
have also to start initiatives for german,

461
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:40.670 
for european infrastructures that's not necessary to spend all our data

462
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.270 
to the american platforms.

463
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.450 
Well, I think there are no more questions in the chat now and

464
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.470 
thank you for your very detailed answers on these questions

465
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:55.020 
and thank everyone for watching and for your interesting questions.

466
00:37:56.110 --> 00:38:00.560 
To finish off, I think, I'm going to quickly share my screen so

467
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.290 
there have been a few questions on AI and I just quickly want

468
00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:08.910 
to show you that on the clean-IT forum we have different sections

469
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.050 
one of which is completely only about clean-AI and different

470
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:18.380 
topics about clean-AI, there's one video about binary neural networks which

471
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.920 
professor Meinel has already talked about just a little bit but there's also

472
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.910 
a few other very important and very interesting topics.

473
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.620 
Just as for the end you can join the the openHPI course for

474
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.790 
free and there you already also get notified for the next talk

475
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:41.230 
which will take place in at the twelfth of july at around the same time

476
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.620 
and also in the same place, in this zoom room again.

477
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:50.910 
Our next speaker then will be Max Plauth from the HPI and

478
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:55.410 
the topic will be: "Energy where computing and trade-offs between

479
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.650 
energy consumption and processing power".

480
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.670 
With that being said, I want to thank you all for coming here

481
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.590 
today, for joining us, for your questions and please if you have

482
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.510 
any more questions or any comments visit us in our forum and on the

483
00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.200 
openHPI course and with that being said see you next time, bye bye.

484
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.440 
Thank you for your attention.

485
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:25.010 
data centres are at the heart of digitization

486
00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:29.860 
cloud applications streaming complex simulations everything

487
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.080 
runs on data centres

488
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.850 
but the ever increasing energy consumption that results is

489
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.790 
a significant contributor to the global carbon footprint

490
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.730 
in the first round of experiments with hp i have discovered

491
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.700 
that if you route the right computational problem to the right computation source

492
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:49.580 
in a heterogeneous data center we can decrease the energy consumption

493
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.250 
of a computation task by up to a factor of ten

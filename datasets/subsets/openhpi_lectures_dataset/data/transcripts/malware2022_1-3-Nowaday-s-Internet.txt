00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.730 
For being prepared to consider
cyberthreats by malware in our

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.550 
openHPI course, we have a closer
look to Nowaday's Internet.

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.360 
Here are the smart devises which we
can use to connect to the internet,

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.360 
to do the services that
are provided in the net.

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.010 
We can use it in home, we can use it
in work and in other places. So

6
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.990 
we can access and use internet application
by computers, by laptops, tablets, smartphones,

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.940 
but also by television and game
consoles but even more by sockets

8
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.810 
and lamps, these are the Internet of Things
(IoT) applications that become more and more

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.870 
common up to tooth brushes and coffee
machines that can interact over the internet.

10
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.200 
Typically it's
organized if we look

11
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.470 
to our home environment. It is organized
in a way that in the middle

12
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.360 
there is a Wi-Fi router

13
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.510 
with a modem which connects the
home situation with the internet

14
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.570 
and the Wi-Fi can be used by
different devices. So we can connect

15
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.710 
to the internet, we can connect by our
game console or by our computer

16
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.520 
over wi-fi to the internet, we can do this
by our smartphone and all the devices

17
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.050 
I had mentioned before.

18
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.840 
The connection of our home situation,
of our home wi-fi to the

19
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.580 
internet is organised in a way
that there is a telephone socket

20
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.260 
or a cable
connection

21
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.640 
which connects us about such a
dial-up modem, such a router

22
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.840 
to a regional ISP. ISP are the
Internet Service Provider or a

23
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
contract partner of such an internet
service provider and then

24
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.330 
the internet
service provider

25
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.450 
takes care for connecting in
this case us with the internet

26
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.430 
and all the other users
of the internet.

27
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.330 
So if we look in a more global
situation, then we have many

28
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.390 
different internet
service providers with

29
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.140 
their circle of networks around which
are using this internet provider

30
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.100 
to connect to the internet and these
internet service provider are

31
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.870 
connected to each other.
They are connected

32
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.200 
to each other and
in this way,

33
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.370 
let's have a look
again, and in this way, some

34
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.190 
network which is connected to this service
provider can interact with users

35
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.360 
that are connected to the internet
by that internet service provider.

36
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.590 
So for the user, the internet
looks like a virtual

37
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.790 
network. A homogeneous
network. Although the

38
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.480 
internet consists of many different
small networks, here is another

39
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.230 
graphic illustration. So we
have different devices that

40
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.320 
are connected to the internet service
provider by being connected

41
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.930 
in a local area network, for example
like such a wi-fi network

42
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.190 
and these networks are connected to
the internet service providers,

43
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.900 
each internet service provider
has many customers,

44
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.220 
many such local

45
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.610 
area networks that are connected and
then the internet service providers

46
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.870 
are interconnected with each other by
the so called backbone, a connection, very

47
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.450 
fast broadband interconnection so
that a machine here which

48
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.930 
gets connect to the internet by means
of that internet service provider

49
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.480 
can easily interact with an
user which is connected

50
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.700 
to this local
area network

51
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.600 
that is connected to the internet
by this internet service provider.

52
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.490 
So the internet today

53
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.490 
is used by everyone around the world
by means of a personal network

54
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.310 
or by means of public access
points, libraries, airports,

55
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.020 
companies and others.

56
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.270 
The internet is everywhere.
We can access

57
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.720 
internet services by
means of our computer,

58
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.150 
by means of our laptop, by
means of our mobile phone,

59
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.220 
even radios and the typical
internet of things devices.

60
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.890 
The use of the
internet technology is also

61
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.840 
very meaningful for private
business corporation.

62
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.320 
They organize their corporation
network by means of the -

63
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.940 
by using the internet
communication protocols.

64
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.300 
These internet inside a private
corporation is called intranet.

65
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.180 
So all attacks that are
working over the internet

66
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.190 
are also working within such intranet
because the same technology is used.

67
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.600 
If we consider mobile applications
then they become more and

68
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.640 
more important in our society, for
example each police vehicle

69
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.240 
is connected to the internet for
providing a fast communication,

70
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.700 
each medical service

71
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.440 
is connected to
the internet

72
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.950 
and many other things too. So
the internet is

73
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.120 
becoming the basic
communication infrastructure

74
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.950 
for our society. And also internet
is changing how we communicate.

75
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.720 
So typically we write
short SMS or short

76
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:37.410 
emails. In the past there was letters
written and sent. Now we can do

77
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.480 
this communication within seconds. We
can process the information that we

78
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.730 
provide in a very fast
way because

79
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.560 
when it is transported over the
internet, it is in a form that

80
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.240 
can be electronically
processed.

81
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.990 
And also the
globalisation is

82
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.830 
pushed forward because
the internet does work

83
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.840 
also beyond the boundaries
of the national states.

84
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.690 
So processing international
transactions becomes easier

85
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.550 
and this all characterize the
internet situation today but

86
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.590 
unfortunately there are no standards
against cybercrime.

87
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.290 
And that's the reason, because for
cybercrime we need regulation,

88
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.320 
we need power to force
such regulations and

89
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.190 
we have here a large deficit
which needs to be closed

90
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:53.300 
over the next decades. We are in this first
years of the internet. Internet was invented

91
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.260 
fifty or sixty
years ago. The world wide

92
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.210 
web which has made the internet
popular is about thirty years old.

93
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.190 
So we are in a very very early
phase of the internet and

94
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:13.610 
in particular the security
inside the internet needs to be

95
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.380 
improved over
the next years.

96
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.580 
So if we look here again to our
internet situation, to the

97
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.750 
ISPs, with the local
area networks, it's a

98
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.250 
connect to the internet, then
the services that are provided

99
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.760 
by the internet, we as a user in
the middle that can access

100
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.700 
that can use the
services over our

101
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.970 
devices and then
there are the attackers.

102
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.800 
And the attacker really attack all what
they can get. They attack the system

103
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.150 
inside the internet which are
connected to the internet, they

104
00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.110 
attack the internet connection,
so the intermediate systems

105
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.590 
that connect
the different

106
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.180 
networks which are
interconnected into the internet,

107
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.210 
they attack the services here that
are provided in the internet and

108
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.960 
they attack the user. The users, the
devices of the user and the application

109
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:25.220 
the user is using. So the
internet nowadays is really

110
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:33.430 
an el dorado for cybercriminals and we
have to learn how to protect us,

111
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.430 
how to protect our data.

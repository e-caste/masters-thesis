00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.220 
Welcome to video clip seven in which
we investigate the consistency

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.080 
of processes and
decisions.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.570 
Introducing this topic I'd like
to come back to an example

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.980 
that we have discussed very
early in this in this course.

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.900 
And that is from modeling theory
we often have the situation

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.780 
that we have one original that we
want to represent in a model

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.430 
and we have several models. We looked
at that example in the context

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.010 
of the design of a kitchen
and we had two models

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.200 
that we see here for the kitchen.
We have here the the picture

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.710 
or the let's say generated picture
how the kitchen would look

11
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.390 
like once it is once it is
constructed and in place

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.240 
and we have a second model and
that is that is an architectural

13
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.150 
plan an architectural design of
that kitchen. So we have one

14
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.610 
original which is the kitchen and we have
two models that represent this original.

15
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.050 
And we can study that these models
need to be consistent. So

16
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.850 
for instance when we have the
oven in this place we also need

17
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.700 
to have the oven in this engineering
map at the same place.

18
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.450 
When we have when we have a
sink here the sink should

19
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.400 
also be here so it would be a
violation if the sink would

20
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960 
be another in another place. And
that is very similar to what

21
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.200 
we like to discuss in this video
clip where we now have different

22
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.740 
models that represent one original.
So in particular we have

23
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.840 
a process model, so a
BPM process diagram,

24
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.000 
we have decision requirements
diagrams, so a DMN DRG

25
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.470 
and we also have a DMN decision
table that specifies the

26
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
decision logic and these three
models need to be consistent

27
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.250 
with each other very similar to
the two models that you see

28
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.360 
here that need to be consistent. So
there must not be any contradictions

29
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.130 
between those different models
that describe one original.

30
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.280 
We start discussing consistency
by looking at the structure.

31
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.840 
So the structural
consistency.

32
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.350 
And this structural consistency involves
decision tasks and decisions,

33
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.340 
data aspects and also
organizational aspects.

34
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.200 
So let's look at the first
consistency property and that

35
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.590 
is for each decision task in the
process model which we have

36
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.460 
here determine basic credit card
eligibility for each decision task

37
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.630 
there must be a corresponding decision
in the decision requirements diagram.

38
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.520 
And that is that is true so here
we have we have a corresponding

39
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.120 
decision called determine basic
credit card eligibility that

40
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.860 
has the same name here. So
that consistency property is

41
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.570 
is satisfied.

42
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.010 
We also need to look at the
data aspects between those

43
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.480 
those different models. Here
in the process model we have

44
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.980 
a data object called
application information

45
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.490 
and here we have inputs and decision
requirements diagram called applicant age

46
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.090 
and applicant
employment status.

47
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.670 
So somehow these reflect the
same the same data objects but

48
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.580 
it's not really
very precise.

49
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.260 
So in general input data object
in the process model need to

50
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.590 
match input data
in the DRG.

51
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.220 
But we have the problem that
data is not represented

52
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.020 
in process model
in a very

53
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.590 
fine granular way, so they might
have a different granularities.

54
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.640 
So that in process models are
just look at the data objects

55
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.000 
in itself and in the decision model
I need to look at the individual

56
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.070 
attributes of these
data objects.

57
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.570 
The approach that we use here
that we also introduce another

58
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.860 
type of model for instance UML
class diagrams and we can

59
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.880 
use these class diagrams to specify attributes
and we can use these attributes then

60
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.430 
again in the DRG. So we need to
make sure that and we need to

61
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.400 
make sure that all data is available
when the decision is actually taken.

62
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.100 
Again models play an important role
here to facilitate communication

63
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.230 
between process and decisions but
also that needs to be aligned with

64
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.460 
UML class diagrams particular
or more general needs to

65
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.440 
be aligned with
the data models.

66
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.580 
We also discussed organizational
aspects and also here we can

67
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.130 
investigate consistency between the
process model and the decision model.

68
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.180 
So in process models

69
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.570 
lanes assign or define
responsibilities.

70
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.400 
So we don't need to look at that
very much detail but we have

71
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.370 
a pool and we have lanes so we have claim
clerk and we have a claim manager

72
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.910 
and these are organisational roles that
are involved in the execution of this

73
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.800 
this process. Consistency
relates to the fact that the

74
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.790 
resources identified by the lane
of decision task need to match

75
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.060 
the decision maker. Remember we introduce
the decision maker as one attribute

76
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.130 
of a decision task and the
decision maker must be related

77
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.130 
and must be the same role
as the role that is

78
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.330 
associated to the lane that has
the respective decision task.

79
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.390 
And that's very natural because
you have the decision task

80
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.510 
that is executed by that role and
when we look at the DRG now

81
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.180 
that role must also be
the decision maker.

82
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.100 
That's a higher or a bit
larger representation

83
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.460 
of the model that we seen before some
of the things we discussed already.

84
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.290 
Here we also have an additional
role called claim manager

85
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.550 
and the claim manager can review
the decision that we've seen

86
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.470 
here before and that manager can
then either say the decision

87
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.300 
is ok then it's taken and the
process continues or the manager

88
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.650 
who is the decision owner then who has
the responsibility about the decision

89
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.600 
puts it back here
and ask the

90
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.750 
claim clerk to again look at the
decision and to refine and possibly

91
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.150 
correct the decision. So
we see here that we can

92
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.300 
specify that we can find a consistency
both between the decision

93
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
maker and also the decision owner,
we can provide consistency

94
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.130 
between the decision model on the
one hand and the process model

95
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.180 
on another level.
Here we have

96
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.980 
we have the decision owner which
is the claim manager and we

97
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.380 
have the decision maker
which is the claim clerk.

98
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.850 
These considerations look just
at the structure of the

99
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.510 
model. We looked at data and
roles and the decision itself

100
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.840 
and now we want to look in a bit
more detail in the behavioral

101
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.470 
aspects or behavior
consistency.

102
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.040 
In particular we want to investigate
if the decision output

103
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.700 
is consistent with the
process behaviour.

104
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.080 
If that is not the case then
there might be problems during

105
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.090 
runtime so that might lead to the process
of coming to a deadlock situation

106
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.640 
and a process getting stuck
in the midst of execution.

107
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.130 
We will investigate basically
two properties which is output

108
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.770 
coverage and dead
branch absence.

109
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:15.670 
Output coverage simply means that all
outputs of the decision can be processed

110
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.570 
by the business process. So there
is no there are no surprises.

111
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.740 
So the decision will not provide a value
of which the process has no idea

112
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.930 
how to process it. The second
property is called dead branch

113
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.920 
absence and that is inspired by the
by the certain soundness criteria.

114
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.810 
This criterion which is which
talks about dead transitions

115
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.780 
and dead branch absence
means that each branch

116
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.390 
in the process is represented by
at least one possible output

117
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.340 
in the decision model.

118
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.300 
So if we have a branching in the
process but we do not have

119
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.870 
the decision cannot return the output
that brings us there then of course

120
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.750 
obviously that branch will never
be executed and its therefore

121
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.090 
called a dead branch.

122
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.300 
We will introduce these two concepts
in a scenario in a fictional

123
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.140 
train ticket
purchasing scenario

124
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.730 
which we see on this
slide. So let's

125
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.620 
let's talk a little bit about the process
that we have that we have here.

126
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.520 
So the process works as follows - so it
starts when a regular booking is received.

127
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.710 
We offer a discount card
to the to our customer.

128
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:46.250 
If the customer chooses the
discount card we have to invoke

129
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.500 
decision task called manage
discount and that returns

130
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.790 
the concrete discount that we
need to apply to this booking.

131
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.100 
And the process has a branch
for twenty five percent

132
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.480 
discount for fifty percent discount
and here is a complete booking.

133
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.630 
And if we do not want, if we do
not take the discount card

134
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.880 
we just go here and we
do the normal booking.

135
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.760 
In the lower part of this figure
of this slide you see the

136
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.710 
decision table of the manage
discounts decision task though

137
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.520 
the decision task is represented
by this decision table.

138
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.070 
We see that unique
hit policy is here.

139
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.480 
So it tells us that we have two different
discount cards so twenty five and fifty.

140
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.160 
If we have less than thousand
points on our card we

141
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.710 
receive twenty five and fifty
percent, if we have large more

142
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.000 
than one thousand points on our
card we receive thirty percent

143
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.520 
and sixty percent
discount respectively.

144
00:10:54.810 --> 00:11:00.120 
Alright so let's take a look at
the output coverage criterion.

145
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.300 
So and here we see and that is a little
updated, a bit of an update here

146
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.330 
which is some
which says that

147
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.810 
if I have more than thousand I
always get sixty percent maybe

148
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.600 
i don't know how realistic that is but
as an example it serves very nicely.

149
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.740 
Ok so here we have the we have
the part of the process model

150
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.370 
that is relevant here so we
have the manage discount

151
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.730 
decision that invokes the manage
discount decision table.

152
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.050 
And as we see here the manage
discount decision table has

153
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.300 
outputs twenty five, fifty
and sixty per cent.

154
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.610 
Looking at the process model we
have a very and we have an

155
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.560 
alternative for twenty five
percent and for fifty percent

156
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.820 
but we do not have an alternative for
sixty percent which is a valid outcome

157
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.250 
of this decision
table and therefore

158
00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.790 
the output coverage criterion
is actually violated because

159
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.900 
there is no branch in the process
for output sixty per cent.

160
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.040 
So let's look at the dead
branch absence criteria.

161
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.640 
Each branch in the process is
represented by at least one row

162
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.570 
in the decision model that
is that is important here.

163
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.610 
So again here we'll have we have
the table variant of the table

164
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.490 
in which we introduced here sixty
five percent. So we have twenty

165
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.630 
five percent, fifty percent,
sixty five percent discount

166
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.100 
and here the process model we
have an sixty percent discount,

167
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.980 
fifty percent discount, twenty
five percent discount.

168
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:50.400 
So and we see here very clearly that we
can never reach discount sixty per cent

169
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.050 
and can never be reached. Why? Well
because sixty is not allowed

170
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.000 
is not a permitted output of
their decision. Therefore that

171
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.890 
branch will never be taken in no process
instance that branch can be taken therefore

172
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.530 
it is a dead branch and the dead
branch absence criteria is

173
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.220 
then therefore
violated.

174
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.890 
No row in the decision table
for branch sixty percent.

175
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.920 
This brings us to the end of
video clip seven in which we

176
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.170 
discussed consistency of
processes and decisions.

177
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.390 
We first looked at structural
consistency investigating activities

178
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.040 
in the process and decisions in the
decision requirements diagram.

179
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.630 
We looked at data aspects we discuss
the role of normal class diagrams

180
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.130 
and also we looked at organizational
aspects and we provide

181
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:53.750 
a link between lanes in the process
model and attributes of decisions.

182
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.170 
We also discussed
behaviour consistency

183
00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:04.960 
and we investigated two properties
called decisions, called a

184
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.260 
well, these two properties are
called output coverage in dead

185
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.130 
branch absence and together
they form a new new property

186
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.190 
that we proposed in the scientific
literature called decision soundness.

187
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:25.110 
And with these consistency criteria
we are very well able to design

188
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:31.370 
decision models, process models also
data models in concert so that they

189
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.960 
that they are able to specify
the complete system without

190
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.020 
any contradictions.

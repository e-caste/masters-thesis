00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.870 
Welcome back! You must have a
lot of ideas in front of you.

2
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.290 
Because you've been busy generating
ideas, it will be good to

3
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.680 
take a minute with your team to
go through the ideas you have

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.560 
and try to cluster those that
share attributes and eliminate

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.120 
replications. Now we'll introduce
you to some techniques for

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.940 
evaluating the ideas that you have
and deciding in your team which

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.040 
ones to move
forward with.

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.060 
Dot voting is a helpful
technique to select ideas

9
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.580 
that are popular in the
team. It's fairly simple.

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.430 
Each person gets three
to five votes,

11
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.100 
depending on how many
ideas you have, and then

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.350 
they vote on their favorite
ideas. You can use

13
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.410 
sticky dots to cast a vote or
you can use markers and each

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.630 
person can go directly and put
a dot on the sticky notes

15
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.100 
that present the idea they
like. This technique is

16
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
quite helpful to select the
popular ideas and especially

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.720 
if you have a lot of good
ideas to choose from

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.560 
it really helps a team to see: &amp;quot;Okay,
what are the popular ideas?&amp;quot;

19
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.040 
And now we have a smaller pool
of ideas that we can select

20
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.890 
from. It's also helpful when
you're under time pressure

21
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.220 
and you want to make fast
decisions in your team.

22
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.300 
In this technique you give your
team multiple criteria to

23
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.180 
choose ideas
based on them.

24
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.170 
An easy way would be
to use color codes.

25
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.250 
You can use color coded
sticky notes or you

26
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.330 
can use different colors of
markers to cast your vote.

27
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.430 
Each color presents
that person's

28
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.790 
top choice in each criteria. For
instance, you can decide in

29
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.950 
your team that blue would be for
those ideas that are low-hanging

30
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.710 
fruits, those that are easy
to implement but not

31
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.510 
necessarily innovative. Or
green would represent

32
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.900 
the idea that addresses
the user need and

33
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.460 
it really delights our user. And
finally you can allocate red

34
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.810 
for radical and wild ideas. This
technique is helpful to encourage

35
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.300 
your team to pick diverse ideas and
not only go for those low-hanging

36
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.490 
fruits and easy ones.

37
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.050 
The two by two matrix is a
good way to map out your

38
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.640 
ideas and get a sense of
the contexts and value

39
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.670 
the ideas have. You can allocates
two different attributes

40
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.490 
to your matrix and then
evaluate your ideas

41
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.560 
in these four quadrants that
happen. For instance you can say

42
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.170 
the y axis is for &amp;quot;originality&amp;quot;,
how new and innovative

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.630 
the ideas are. And the
x axis would be for

44
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.380 
how good our ideas are actually
addressing the user need,

45
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.960 
is delighting our users.
And then you can go

46
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.640 
ahead and discuss in your team
and map out the ideas that you

47
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.040 
have. And move them around as well.
So, you can discuss in your team

48
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.850 
upfront which one of these
quadrants actually

49
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.060 
is the most relevant for you. So
this is a helpful technique

50
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.770 
to understand the
context and value

51
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.190 
of the ideas that you have and to
have an open discussion in your

52
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.030 
team! This is especially
helpful when you have

53
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.710 
more time for idea
selection and you can

54
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.730 
have lengthly discussions in your
team about different attributes

55
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.550 
of your ideas.

56
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.320 
Idea funnel is a technique
that will help you

57
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.670 
map out your ideas through
a funnel and select

58
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.770 
those that remain.
You can set

59
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.760 
a couple of criteria upfront in
your team and then examine

60
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.900 
each idea through them. For instance,
you can go for these criteria:

61
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.900 
How good an idea resonates with your
user, originality, implementation,

62
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.090 
and finally if your team
is passionate about it.

63
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.030 
So you can decide, and ask
in your team, if your idea

64
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.590 
delights your user, if it
addresses their need.

65
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.120 
If yes, you can move them down,
if not leave them behind.

66
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.510 
And then you can ask how new
and original this idea is.

67
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.750 
If it's new, move it one level
down. And then you can ask:

68
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.610 
&amp;quot;Is it possible to implement it, is
it easy to implement?&amp;quot;, as the

69
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.830 
criteria. If yes, again we move
it one level down. And finally,

70
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.260 
are we as a team passionate
about implementing this idea?

71
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.830 
You can move it one level
down. Idea funnel is a great

72
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.210 
tool when you have a lot of
ideas so you can examine

73
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.320 
each idea through different
criteria that are important for

74
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.120 
you as a team. It also helps you
to make decisions about ideas

75
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
that fulfill different categories.
For instance, if your

76
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.810 
solution really has to fully
different criteria, idea funnel

77
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.980 
would be a good tool for
that. Use idea funnel

78
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.670 
maybe at the end of the

79
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.320 
idea selection, as the last
technique, because what remains

80
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.340 
are those ideas that you really
want to move forward with as

81
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.020 
a team. Of course there are many
more tools and techniques for

82
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.770 
selecting ideas but these are
some of our favorite ones.

83
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.200 
So we hope that you try
them out and have fun.

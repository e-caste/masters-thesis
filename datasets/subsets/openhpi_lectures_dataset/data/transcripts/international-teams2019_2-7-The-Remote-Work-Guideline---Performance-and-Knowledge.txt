00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.270 
So, Salim, you mentioned before
something about performance and

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.190 
How the management can support
the performance of the workers?

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.030 
Also, how remote teams can
actually share knowledge?

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.330 
and since performance and knowledge
are really important topics

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.170 
as well could you please elaborate
more on both? Definitely,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960 
remote work relies on performance
and all the knowledge.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.350 
knowledge is no longer been
processed as it happened in

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.610 
traditional offices, where people
meet and discuss some things

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.000 
now the meetings are
happening virtually

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.200 
are other tools and also that
impact a lot of the performance

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.770 
of the teams. Now in order to have
a good performance you need

12
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.090 
to have clear and transparent
performance criteria and assessment

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.400 
techniques. If you don't
define, what are the goals to

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.540 
achieve, when we want to achieve
them, and which are the criteria

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.320 
to define if it is a
good achievement or

16
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.080 
poor achievement, then
you cannot start

17
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.390 
going into conflict with teams saying
that you didn't achieve. No,

18
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.340 
if you don't have a clear target,
don't ask for any kind of

19
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.500 
success in remote teamwork because
even now is by far more important

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.620 
than in the traditional offices
to have clear targets.

21
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.340 
Probably this is one of the
advantages of working remotely,

22
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.570 
now you have to have remote..
sorry you have to have a

23
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.170 
objectives and goals to
achieve, if you don't have it

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.400 
then the remote teamwork
will be completely lost.

25
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
This is extremely
important, defines things

26
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.300 
that are transparent
for all the teams.

27
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.980 
Now remote workers and the
managers they need to agree with

28
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.130 
something that you can
measure, you cannot say

29
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.920 
some targets will be achieved
in two weeks and we expect to

30
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.050 
see what comes with. How would they measure
this? you need to define for instance

31
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.220 
you want to have, I will make an
example, you need to have a

32
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.000 
billing format ok, a template,
then at the end of the

33
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.540 
the week you will have a billing
template but if you say ...if you

34
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.150 
give us a commitment, we
need an invoicing process

35
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.310 
for printing the latest
products we sell.

36
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.320 
No, you're defining something
so confused without.. very

37
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160 
ambiguous and then people will
start to try it. Probably someone

38
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.580 
is gonna make a spreadsheet, another
one will make a pdf document

39
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.630 
and the other one will make a word
document. If you don't know

40
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.960 
go and make a concrete a requirement,
then people will start

41
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.240 
getting lost and this is
very very important and

42
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.710 
people give people something
that they can achieve,

43
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.750 
in a period of time, don't think
because they are outside

44
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.230 
and they have all the time...
No... give them something that

45
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.950 
they can achieve, otherwise then, they
will start with another problem,

46
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.320 
in the remote team is the
frustration. Ohh...

47
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.270 
I didn't do anything, I
did not achieve a thing.

48
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.250 
Give them something that
they can achieve,

49
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.000 
in the period of time that you
define. The quality and quantity

50
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.130 
of achievements are evaluated
based on records.

51
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.050 
Mainly you need something that
allows you to track what the

52
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.600 
people are doing, therefore,
the relevance of the tools

53
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.670 
that Tom mentioned before, this
project management tools

54
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.800 
then you can see who is working on what
and you will see the achievements.

55
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.830 
Some of this tool they say... they
allow you to say okay, this time

56
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.750 
I achieve the task one hundred
percent or just achieve eighty

57
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.580 
percent of the task. Mainly the
idea behind this is that you

58
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.910 
try to get rid of a
subjective opinion.

59
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.490 
you have something, it is
there, I did, I perform

60
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.490 
I deployed, developed something
and then the manager can say

61
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.290 
OK, yes he did it or she did it. If
you start making mm...assumptions

62
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.680 
probably could be better, it is
something very valuable but it is

63
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.420 
necessary to be based on one
single line, the achievement.

64
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.480 
Achievement...., what do you
define to be achieved?

65
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.680 
Well, besides taking the
achievement into consideration

66
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.630 
and also the setting up, targets,
and goals. I think communication

67
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.140 
here plays a great role,
like clear communication

68
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.230 
between the management and the teams...
Hanadi without Communication we will

69
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.630 
not have anything. Communication,
trust is definitely something

70
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.970 
very important. If you
have poor communication

71
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.560 
the performance will go
down because you have

72
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.890 
not achieved to interact with
your people out there and

73
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.230 
also, not you just with
the people out there.

74
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.890 
All the people out there need
to interact with each other.

75
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.040 
If they don't define their
own rhythm of communication

76
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.480 
which tools are been used
for communication?

77
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.710 
If this is not clear, is not defined,
there will not be communication

78
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.450 
therefore, there is no
achievement at the end

79
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.920 
to complain, also it is
important this remote

80
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.920 
teamwork culture, you need to bring
it slowly and make it kind of

81
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.430 
working lifestyle because
there are many people

82
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.370 
they cannot live with this
immediately, therefore, you just can

83
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.270 
offer intermittent
remote work, it means

84
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.260 
two days a week you work
remotely, three days a week

85
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.100 
to work at the office and start
changing this and make people

86
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.300 
just to have this not
overlapping task all the time.

87
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.960 
Probably you are working
today remotely, I'm working

88
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.640 
today at the office and tomorrow is
different but make this kind of rotation

89
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.670 
it brings the organization in a
new rhythm and they then will

90
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.040 
start finding, ok,
what are the issues?

91
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.550 
what are the good things? what are the
bad things? Do not take as a reference

92
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.090 
what currently work in another
organization, probably

93
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.790 
would not work in your organization,
this is very very important.

94
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.090 
Now when we are
talking about

95
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.950 
the performance, the
performance is related also

96
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.450 
to knowledge. Absolutely yeah. And knowledge...
there are two different kinds of

97
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.200 
knowledge the explicit
knowledge and tacit knowledge

98
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.280 
The explicit knowledge is
that one, that is stored

99
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.330 
in the database, in documents, in
presentation, in videos, in blogs

100
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.470 
in CRMs. Is information
that is somewhere stored,

101
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.420 
digitally stored, but there is
another kind of knowledge which

102
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.890 
is if you see the
pyramid we have there

103
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.670 
it is potentially more than half of
the knowledge that organization

104
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.790 
manages and this is the Tacit
knowledge, thisTacit knowledge

105
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.590 
comes out from interaction, from
experiences, from practices

106
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.490 
from values. When we talk to
each other face to face

107
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.290 
we are building a lot
of... creating a lot of

108
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.920 
knowledge and this
knowledge can be gone.

109
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.190 
Therefore, now that we are
bringing this communication

110
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.280 
outside to the remote environment
where there is no physical

111
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.160 
contact between us but
we still interact.

112
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.580 
This information that
we are exchanging

113
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.220 
we need to bring it
into a digital world

114
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.140 
and some of the tools that Tom
mentioned before, this project

115
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.900 
management, this document
tools, the sharing tools.

116
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.570 
all of these tools help us in order
to bring all this information

117
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.250 
in a digital way in a by far
more reliable organization.

118
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.550 
It means this new structure is
making a bit bigger explicit

119
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.510 
knowledge and reducing
the tacit knowledge.

120
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.300 
When someone then leaves organization
not everything is gone

121
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.760 
of course...
Information is lost.

122
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.370 
Not all, a lot of information, of
course, you cannot retain but

123
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.950 
a lot of information is now recorded
in some of these databases

124
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.100 
or in some of these tools
that Tom mentioned before.

125
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.500 
and this is also a big
advantage, is something...

126
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.870 
In a lot of the experience, we
have in some organization

127
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.700 
you start seeing how processes
start to be documented

128
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.500 
now the communication start
being by far more effective

129
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.030 
because someone finds a mistake in
one document correct that mistake

130
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.370 
and that is more reliable
information there.

131
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.350 
This is something that in
knowledge management,

132
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.490 
also, it is the improvement
that the remote teamwork

133
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.560 
brings with..... How do you recommend
those team members themselves

134
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.600 
to share knowledge or exchange
information? This is a very good

135
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.590 
point because each remote worker,
each one, they have their own

136
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.610 
knowledge but then all
of them are building

137
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
knowledge online community.
Wherever we are sharing

138
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.920 
we are building knowledge
together and we are bringing

139
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.350 
something is called, collective
intelligence, each one

140
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.940 
is bringing it with a
purpose. The purposes

141
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.780 
is the organization and then this
organization start now having

142
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.000 
more knowledge but we can
not forget that the

143
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.940 
remote workers, they have some
personalities, they have some

144
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.100 
experiences, they have
some cognitive styles

145
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.250 
they have different elements
that bring them to share.

146
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.730 
and this is something that it is
relevant to consider because

147
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.190 
whenever you are good in, let's
say in correcting something

148
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.090 
reading and correcting, some people
just want to put information

149
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.030 
there, finish. Some others want
to structure the information in

150
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.280 
a pre... an elegant way, in a
better way, so that everyone

151
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.870 
will understand. You need
also to consider the role

152
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.440 
of the remote workers outside
are also playing... also some

153
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.100 
advantages in order to have a
better understanding there.

154
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.320 
Of course all these tools
they will have a management

155
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.400 
roles, where probably the team
leader structuring the information

156
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.640 
some other people
are asking to make

157
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.990 
some extra documentation
in a graphical way

158
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.650 
and all this is helping the whole
organization to manage their

159
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.330 
knowledge and then at the end to
build a collective intelligence

160
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.120 
for the whole organization.
Interesting, thank you so much, Salim

161
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.400 
and now guys would like you to
participate in the discussion

162
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.970 
board, if you have any
questions about the topic,

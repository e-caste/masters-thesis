1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 
Cloud computing
cannot be

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.260 
realized without internet. When we speak
about one of the very big success stories

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.910 
of the internet it said
it is cloud computing.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.910 
So internet brings cloud computing. It
offers a completely new possibility

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.310 
to use machines and storage
for digital data.

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.390 
It provides the possibility to
use it remotely. So to use a

7
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.030 
computer that's far away or a storage
that's far away from the place.

8
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.210 
And all this activities
are head lighted by the

9
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.890 
term cloud computing.

10
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.830 
So it's interesting to ask you what
comes to your mind when you hear

11
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.020 
the term cloud computing. This is a
possibility that computers work

12
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.740 
with a cloud of data.

13
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.360 
Is a cloud a place on earth
similar to silicon valley in the

14
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.620 
USA or is it about meteorological
calculation, for example weather forecast?

15
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:21.040 
Of course it is not. Cloud computing
means that it's possible to use

16
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.030 
computing resources, storage
resources in the internet.

17
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
And you already I am quite sure you
already used cloud computing.

18
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.470 
For example when you
shared data online.

19
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.870 
Data with google drive, dropbox,
with iCloud, with Bdrive

20
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.820 
or when you retrieved a navigation route and
if you get actual traffic information.

21
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.380 
Then you have to use the cloud
infrastructure. Or when you are

22
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.110 
searched for an
information on wikipedia

23
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.520 
or if you did some collaboration
work collaborating work

24
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.310 
with other people working
on the same document.

25
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.860 
All such applications are possible and
only possible by cloud computing.

26
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.520 
So cloud computing
means that storage

27
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.430 
and the calculation are done and
offered a computing hardware

28
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.060 
that can be reached
via internet.

29
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.200 
So it's no more necessary
to own a computer

30
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.400 
to do some computational work. It's no
more necessary to own storage devices.

31
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.870 
You can use this over the internet, there are
cloud providers that offer the service.

32
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.220 
So cloud is also a synonym for
computing or working on the internet.

33
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.190 
Cloud computing uses data storage which
is offered in computing centers

34
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.240 
that can be reached over the
internet and cloud computing uses

35
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.230 
computing capacity. The computing
capacity typically on virtual machines

36
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.380 
that are reachable
over the internet.

37
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.550 
So when we speak about cloud computing
the notion of virtual machine

38
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.050 
is vary simple.

39
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.020 
What is a virtual machine? A virtual
machine it's not hardware.

40
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.940 
It's a software program. It's a software
program that exactly looks like

41
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.910 
a normal hardware
computer.

42
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.410 
I repeat, a virtual machine is
the program a software program.

43
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.290 
You can switch off, you can switch
on, you can switch off, you can

44
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.650 
let run it on
another hardware.

45
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.570 
It's not necessary that this hardware
this program runs on the same hardware

46
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.460 
as it's a virtual machine as a
type of virtual machine which

47
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.500 
is offered by the software program. So this
software that simulates that behaves

48
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.940 
like a computer. Like a concrete computer
with a concrete storage model.

49
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.000 
So a cloud system consists of
an hardware infrastructure.

50
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.450 
This can be mainframes
huge computer

51
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.800 
which a accessible computing
and storage resources

52
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.920 
and the user
can choose,

53
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.420 
the user can
run programs,

54
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
programs on the
hardware.

55
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.760 
So a user can run a
virtual machine

56
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.530 
that are programmed on that
hardware and the users can choose

57
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.720 
the type of virtual machine over
the internet and then start

58
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.320 
access and control the machine
with for example such an a

59
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.100 
low performance device.

60
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.530 
So huge computation can be done
by means of a smartphone. This

61
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.000 
says huge computation is not done on
smartphones. The smartphone is only

62
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.910 
your interaction tool with the computing
infrastructure in the cloud.

63
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.040 
So on this hardware
sorry on this hardware

64
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.670 
there many users run their
own virtual machines.

65
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.200 
In this way it is
possible to run

66
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.400 
complex and sophisticated
applications with

67
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.360 
from a controlled from such
a low performance devices.

68
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.890 
So the advantage of the
advantages of cloud computing

69
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.420 
of course are that
sophisticated applications

70
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.170 
can run using resources
from the internet.

71
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.760 
If many people want to use a
service many people want

72
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.890 
to use the service simply the number
of virtual machines increase

73
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.230 
that provides
a service.

74
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.400 
This reduces the hardware requirement
on the side of the user

75
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.440 
as well in the private life as
well as in small companies.

76
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.820 
It's no more necessary to have
an own computing centre.

77
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.910 
It's enough to have a device like
smartphone or tablet which is

78
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.640 
which can interact with such a cloud
as services in the internet and can

79
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.240 
control and run virtual
devices there.

80
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:55.940 
So in this way the end devices can
become smaller, can become more mobile

81
00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.090 
that are necessary to stay in my
company close to my computing

82
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.780 
centre I can move around and I
can control via smartphone.

83
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.810 
So the applications of mobile devices
usually do not run on the smartphone.

84
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:20.290 
They run in the cloud and the smartphone
is only for input output data

85
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.320 
for services. This
provides the

86
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:32.800 
advantage that also from different devices
one can access the same resource.

87
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.800 
If the resource document for example
would be a log would be stored on your

88
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.000 
laptop then it would be difficult
from your smartphone to access this

89
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.760 
document. In the
cloud it is easy.

90
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.190 
From the small phone you can
extract the document in same way

91
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.480 
like from your
computer.

92
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.930 
But there are also some
downsides of cloud computing.

93
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.870 
So the small end devices
like smartphones

94
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.680 
allow calculation, allow to
start such calculation but the

95
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.310 
calculation itself is carried out
away anywhere in the internet

96
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.140 
anywhere into cloud.
In the result

97
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.490 
also the data are stored there. The data
are not on your device, the data are

98
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.630 
anywhere in the cloud
in the internet

99
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.310 
and are processed in locations
that typically are not known.

100
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:42.850 
So a user does not know
who exactly has access

101
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:49.210 
to his or her data, who is the
administrational people, what

102
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.410 
are assessing and if you
use cloud services

103
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.560 
which are cost free

104
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.340 
then you have to think how
cloud providers are able to

105
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:07.770 
maintain this infrastructure this very
expensive to run the computer is expensive

106
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.050 
like a computer center
is expensive.

107
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.170 
Sotypically what they
do is they sell data

108
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:22.360 
from the user. They analyze data and
sell the results of this analytics.

109
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.940 
Sometimes also there are some
hidden costs so you need to be

110
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.820 
careful as well with the data
protection as well as the costs

111
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.360 
before you are using such
cloud infrastructure.

112
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.120 
So keep questioning is a big advise
for all kind of cloud computing.

113
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.190 
Which cloud is used by your app
if you have an fitness tracker?

114
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:52.410 
What's a kind of cloud this is using?
Where your data are transferred?

115
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.500 
Where are your data stored,
particularly very private data?

116
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:05.410 
Sso cloud computing is a fascinating possibility
to provide the computational power

117
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.340 
a storage power to any
place in the world.

118
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.750 
Computation is done in the internet,
in cloud computing centres.

119
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.340 
So it has a huge amount of
advantages but you have also to

120
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.170 
be careful thinking and what happens with
the data in the cloud ,who has access,

121
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.240 
so there are also
downsides.

1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.000 
so Salim we've heard about leadership
issues about coordination

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.270 
or problems that
can pop up

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.340 
what other challenges are
there..... well Tom there

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.010 
several other challenges we
mentioned before the employees

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.190 
they have some issues, the
management may have some issues

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
but the general concept of
remote work they may have

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.330 
another challenges challenges what
i mention here is not something

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.000 
that it will happen but it can
happen and this we need to have

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.340 
an eye on that because when
suddenly something like

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.270 
that appears is a huge
escalation that will need to

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.330 
have more time, the task
will not be achieved

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.250 
in all of this stuff and
we have a list here

13
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.580 
of some of them that also
challenge the teleworking

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.160 
environment from the
perspective of the employee

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.550 
the employee we always expect
they are disciplined in what

16
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.810 
they are doing because we counted
the people outside there

17
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770 
will have auto discipline, they
will manage themselves they will

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.850 
will achieve, it's not a
time it's not always

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.500 
probably there are people
that they get distracted

21
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.510 
or some other people are perfectionist
those are at the other

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.880 
extreme perfection and until
his task is not completed

23
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.990 
perfectly, he will not stop doing
it and he will also expect other

24
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.170 
people to also be perfect you
will start having there some

25
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.280 
trouble he's not delivering
she's not delivering

26
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.330 
all the stuff, then the auto
discipline plays a role

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.040 
it is a bit tricky also in the
self management you have five

28
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.830 
hours to achieve something, "i
would do it in one hour, it is

29
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.300 
easy for me"... take your time,
start doing the self management

30
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.730 
trying to achieve the
task as soon as you can

31
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.760 
don't wait "I will do it this
weekend because.." hmmm no,

32
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
do it right now because it will
make also an overhead on your

33
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.700 
management style and a you will
get tired" ohh no I need to

34
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.910 
work during the weekend"... no you had
the time during the week, when you were

35
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.040 
supposed to do that, do it in that
time otherwise you will destroy

36
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.480 
now this work life balance
if you want to achieve

37
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.340 
you will move all your
task for the weekend

38
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.420 
then you will not have
family weekend at all

39
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.670 
sure.... this is very
very important

40
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.420 
from the side of the organization
it is necessary to transmit

41
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.030 
this organizational management
organizational management is

42
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.550 
important because when you
don't see people face to face

43
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.090 
something start failing there,
you miss something, you miss

44
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.470 
a close relation to the people
but if the organizations

45
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.880 
transmit.. "ehyy you outside,
wherever you are. i don't care, you are

46
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.900 
performing wherever you are you
are doing a great job"

47
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.940 
or "you need to improve here
because there is something not

48
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.110 
working on".. not everything
is perfect i say sometimes

49
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.300 
you have issues but if the
organization is transmitting

50
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.550 
"ehyyy, i want you to be there,
I want you to perform even better

51
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.830 
than how you're performing" and
you're having your work life balance

52
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.080 
it is important to mention this if
you don't have enough coordination

53
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.930 
as we say before in some slides
you will have an issue

54
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.730 
coordination that you know
what they are doing

55
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.170 
and they know what they are
expecting from your site

56
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.860 
as well, motivation don't expect
you as an employee, as a remote

57
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.140 
worker to get more motivation
from your organization

58
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.820 
motivation is used deal, you
need to deal with that

59
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.900 
so you need to motivate yourself
yourself if you say "this is

60
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.930 
crazy for me, I cannot work
remotely" then talk to your leader

61
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.340 
and they would say ok,
then they will move you

62
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.250 
because motivation it is something
that you don't expect an

63
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.320 
organization to motivate
you, the organization

64
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.010 
is there to perform to
deliver some services to

65
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.680 
i don't know to
manufacture some product

66
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.160 
but the motivation is inside
you and then you need to push

67
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.920 
if you're willing to do
something, the organization may

68
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.090 
respond you probably the remote
team work, it's a kind of a

69
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.950 
motivation for you if it
doesn't motivate you

70
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.540 
to say "sorry this is not
for me" and be open

71
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.130 
so be open and and rather say i
would rather go back and work

72
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.690 
in my office.... exactly
or you can say as well

73
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.250 
because this is also something
that is really really

74
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.140 
used at the moment, is that ok
only one or two days a week

75
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.980 
what that is kind of like
splitting and nothing like

76
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.020 
or no off so there's a lot of
kind of a shape in between

77
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.830 
is it is something that,
ok it keeps me motivated

78
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.640 
this day and this day i'm working
remotely and the other days

79
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.810 
im coming to office fine but talk go go
go and go and transmit this information

80
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.540 
the feedback, this is the
reason also the feedback

81
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.740 
if you're there, having a problem
at home or remotely where you're

82
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.100 
working and you're not
saying anything sorry

83
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.530 
nothing will happen the open
communication is key again

84
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.400 
key again for this culture to
work otherwise it wont happen

85
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.100 
i mean, culture
again you say it

86
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.080 
if i'd just think a
little bit back about

87
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.450 
that you're not
fully working

88
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.700 
remotely but then some some
part of the of your work

89
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.080 
or working in the office a in the
beginning said without that

90
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.930 
making the
employee's work

91
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.240 
remotely, can save you a
lot of money because

92
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.940 
the smaller of spaces but then a
i mean in this case you also

93
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.180 
need to do something about the culture
in your new your organization

94
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.270 
that you for example can share
some tasks, like i have kind

95
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.100 
of more mobile..... this is a
fantastic point Tom, because also it

96
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.050 
will relate also the IT people
whenever you have a desk

97
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.620 
this is not your desk is a
sharing desk whatever you

98
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.670 
need to have your desk clean and
the big advantage is that all

99
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.140 
information will be in servers,
will be remotely accessible

100
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.660 
then this IT. we
mentioned on the past

101
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.280 
IT needs to be involved in the
process and also IT needs

102
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.640 
offer this flexibility
if you start buying

103
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.720 
power desks, power computers, i'm
sorry it is not flexible you

104
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.600 
cannot move out whenever you want
and this is the point when

105
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.000 
you say we will have an let's
say and hybrid structure where

106
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.590 
people are working sometimes
remotely sometimes here

107
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.520 
probably you will have all
the time ten people out

108
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.130 
and then you will have if we
have a team of fifty then you

109
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.720 
have forthy places ready for all
the time when these ten are

110
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.540 
coming their ten from this
team they are going out

111
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.250 
this flexibility it brings a new
dynamic and you will see creativity

112
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.270 
flexibility everything will
improve your organization this

113
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.430 
is something that is very valid
point in order to improve to

114
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.540 
consider that IT is taking
care of this part

115
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
let's say another list of
challenges whatever you are doing

116
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.780 
outside some people really
enjoy being alone

117
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.680 
but some people get crazy, --"ehy
i have no one to talk here, i

118
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.710 
want to have a cup of coffee and
in the kitchen"... no

119
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.930 
social isolation is something
that you cannot ignore

120
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.860 
people need contact also the
tools that you mentioned before

121
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.600 
the videocommunication it
brings a kind of close

122
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.080 
interaction to people but still......
it's not it's not really

123
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.710 
the tool for coffee breaks.... exactly
it is not the tool for coffee breaks

124
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.410 
and lets mention something,
this is the reason why apple

125
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.350 
named their tool for
communication face time

126
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.460 
because the face time this time
that we interact where we

127
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.110 
I don't know we move ourselves
we express we show emotions

128
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.020 
it is something extremely
valuable in the organization

129
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.300 
social isolation may be an
issue for some people

130
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.700 
distractions i don't know probably
you have worked in the past

131
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.460 
some days remotely and you sometimes
you not always perfectly

132
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.910 
concentrated..... i mean particularly
if we work at home and you're

133
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.700 
not alone at home your wife says
"i made some food"

134
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.460 
if you're lucky ok just
running around and wants

135
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.660 
to play stuff like that so if you
have all of these distractions

136
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.320 
Post man comes and stuff like that.....
exactly and this distraction

137
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.820 
this is the reason why
we mentioned before

138
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.720 
is better if you would have an
space for yourself where you are

139
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.580 
isolated from all these
domestic situations

140
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.040 
it would be better for security
reasons for data protection

141
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.730 
and also distractions will
not be all the time there

142
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.080 
slow communication important
whatever happened

143
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.560 
you as a manager or you as an
employee, say it right away

144
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.480 
don't wait.... "ahhh we will have
to meet in one week"... no

145
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.620 
mistake, do it, call i don't
know you have chats videos

146
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.890 
telephone all the tools, start
communication communication is

147
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.230 
there use it just like
that, work life balance

148
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.310 
it is a very very important fact
for people to work in a remotely

149
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:45.160 
because they they engage are more
engaged with the organization

150
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.440 
they think the part of my
life is work part my life

151
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.990 
is his living, no just make
a kind of work balancing

152
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.440 
so, it's really important particularly
if you're working at home

153
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.190 
not you that you
actually do not worsen

154
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.710 
the the work life balance that
you have before because it is

155
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.320 
working longer exactly and there
is no kind of real distinction

156
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.170 
anymore between work and.... exactly
and it may lead to another

157
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.130 
problem which you don't have
before but then you will start

158
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.790 
working more hours and a
your family will ask

159
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.010 
what now we don't have a
family now this is something

160
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.550 
is a balance is necessary
there, ambiguity

161
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.260 
ambiguity if it is really common
i must say is really common

162
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.780 
and it is because the targets
are not clear and probably

163
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.640 
you don't know what they are
doing you are working in a team

164
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.770 
of five people yeah
how you will

165
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.240 
until you are not clearly said
what you want to achieve, who

166
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.370 
is one who is responsible
for something

167
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.330 
don't start the program you may
need to make sure that ambiguity

168
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.600 
is not there, and finally the less
structure whenever you have a team

169
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.950 
in the team you have responsibilities
and in the responsibilities

170
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.380 
also you have a kind of little
structure there who is the leader

171
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.470 
of this task, make clear
that this also this

172
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.980 
little structures
or hierarchy

173
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.300 
are defined because otherwise you will start
having situations like "you're not my

174
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.570 
boss you are not here to say anything
about what i need to do"

175
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.990 
make sure this structure is clear
for you for your employer

176
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.850 
and for everyone who is working....
so actually you need you mean

177
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.520 
we need more structure we need
more structure because normally

178
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.950 
this structure in the
traditional office is given

179
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.280 
something that yeah i
know that you are

180
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.220 
higher than me and you have
decision power but when you start

181
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.920 
living the normal traditional
office it is there are some

182
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.140 
other considerations these
were let's say tom

183
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.700 
the most challenging elements
that we have found in the past

184
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.160 
i hope the community there can
comment on them.... yeah

185
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.980 
so we hope again contribute
come up with your own

186
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.530 
issues that you that
you experienced

187
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.820 
come up with questions and trying to
discussion.... we will welcome all of them..

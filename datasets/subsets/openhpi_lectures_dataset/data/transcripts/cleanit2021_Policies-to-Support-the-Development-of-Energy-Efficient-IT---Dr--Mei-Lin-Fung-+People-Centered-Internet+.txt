1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.830 
Such an honor!

2
00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:09.960 
And as an Asian woman, it's truly an honor to be recognized in Europe.

3
00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.060 
I live in the United States in Palo Alto, California.

4
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.760 
I have been there for the last four decades, but I grew up in Singapore.

5
00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.809 
Ah yes!

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.339 
The beginning of the keynote.

7
00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.640 
I grew up in Singapore and every year when I was young we would go to an island.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.659 
It was called Saint John's Island.

9
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:43.619 
If I closed my eyes, I can remember the beautiful ocean, the sun and just the sea, the magic of the sea.

10
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:53.350 
Earlier today we talked about how if you want to build ships, you don't teach about building the ships.

11
00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.060 
You talk about, learn about how to yearn for the sea.

12
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.359 
I yearned for the sea of my youth.

13
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.859 
In my youth there was no such great garbage pile of plastic. In 1965,

14
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:25.819 
there was a famous film called "The Graduate" and the advice given to the graduate was "I have one word for you, young man! Plastics!".

15
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.299 
Now let's come to 2022.

16
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
What is the one word we would give to the young man, woman or LGBTQ+?

17
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.519 
That one word would be "Digital".

18
00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:55.969 
It is upon us now that one word "Digital" to the graduates of today does not end up in the great garbage pile in

19
00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:05.450 
40 years because as we rush to use digital technology, we have to be careful about the harms that come along.

20
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.250 
I want to say that here in Germany you are way ahead of the game in thinking about clean IT.

21
00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.360 
And that's why I have immersed myself in our collaboration.

22
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.509 
It reminds me of the role that Germany played in physics for many many years.

23
00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.349 
Anybody doing a physics PhD had to learn German.

24
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.050 
Why was that?

25
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.939 
It was because so many of the advances in physics were done here, in Germany.

26
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.580 
Advance to 40 years,

27
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.139 
they will say you have to know German because the clean IT was born here.

28
00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.849 
It's so important.

29
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.759 
Everything that we've talked about today and these discussions are not happening anywhere else in the world.

30
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.039 
So I've had the pleasure

31
00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:16.099 
through our collaboration, the G20 last year in Italy. I've been involved in the Germany Think7 and the policy brief

32
00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:26.060 
that we're doing and it's really made me aware of what does it take to have policy makers make this change?

33
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.960 
How do I advance the slides? Can we go?

34
00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.439 
Good!

35
00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.460 
Good, thank you!

36
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.460 
So I've already just talked about that.

37
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.340 
Okay!

38
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.840 
Why do I say this?

39
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.169 
Many of you know IPv4.

40
00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.349 
The internet protocol version 4.

41
00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:01.240 
If you put all of those addresses into the size of a beach ball,

42
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.729 
The current set of Internet addresses, IPv6

43
00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.750 
is the volume of the sun.

44
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.110 
So how can we expect that

45
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:19.500 
our intuition, our expectation of how things work which had developed in the size of the beach ball expand to the sun?

46
00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:31.939 
We can't! We have to take preparation, we have to do things very differently. London town, 400 years ago, it was a very smelly

47
00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:39.339 
place because people took the habits of living in a small village where you could kind of throw your waste products out the

48
00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:48.560 
window and they kept doing that in London where there was like a million people. We are about to do that with digital, we've

49
00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:55.160 
got to work out how to move things forward and it's not a technical problem.

50
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.040 
It's a question of will, it's a question of the people deciding that we want better than this. You can imagine in London,

51
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.560 
they'd say, "well, you should throw your waste this way, you need a bigger ditch".

52
00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.160 
They had to make a big decision to put in a sewage system before it really got fixed.

53
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:30.100 
And really we're looking at that with the internet, how can we prepare our world, our people for an internet of digital technology

54
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.550 
where there are, it's the volume of the sun, we're not equipped.

55
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.540 
And these questions that just came up in the new panel, you know,

56
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.740 
how can we be energy efficient?

57
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.060 
There was a time when fountains only flowed downwards.

58
00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:58.389 
I went to the summer palace at that time Leningrad, but now Saint Petersburg and they had great fountains but they had

59
00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.550 
to store the water for days or months because they only flowed downhill.

60
00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:12.379 
So that's kind of where we are with energy now, we're just designing all of the software, not even counting how much energy

61
00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:16.660 
it takes and we're using and using and using it up.

62
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.259 
So, here we are at the clean-IT Forum.

63
00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:34.930 
But at the German G7, Think7, we've had a chance to present thinking about this.

64
00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:47.560 
And the interest is great because people are looking to Europe and in Europe - Germany. How do we move forward with digital?

65
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:53.660 
It's not just energy efficiency, it's privacy, it's how do we use data?

66
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.160 
How does data get governed?

67
00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:06.410 
Are there new kinds of models we have as a world to think about. How do we have people flourish where data can help them

68
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.160 
flourish?

69
00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:11.509 
So you all know this.

70
00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:13.600 
We've been talking about this all day.

71
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.060 
But clean IT.

72
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.160 
is a German G7 priority. Within the Think7,

73
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.410 
we had, I think, four cabinet ministers from Germany and Olaf Scholz spoke yesterday.

74
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.759 
Not yesterday, on Monday.

75
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:43.360 
The commitment, the understanding brought into sharp focus by the Russian invasion of Ukraine has meant that Germany more

76
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.860 
than any time in decades is ready to act.

77
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.459 
I'm a woman and a mother.

78
00:07:54.339 --> 00:08:02.970 
You know, when there's a real threat to the whole family but the two boys over there are fighting, you say, "stop fighting!"

79
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.060 
"Hey, we gotta go to the real threat. Face the real threat."

80
00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:12.120 
So I'm saying, well, a lot of people are distracted about the war.

81
00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:16.839 
The real threat is the climate

82
00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:27.379 
and what I'm seeing here is the chance for Germany, for Hasso Plattner Institute, for SAP to say, "let's go after the real

83
00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:27.930 
threat."

84
00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:41.259 
Let's come together, unify ourselves and work on the problem that faces every single person in the world today. And every single

85
00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:46.340 
one of the future generations.

86
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:56.120 
They call it the horizon problem which is that we are making political decisions today in their own context, weighing up

87
00:08:56.129 --> 00:09:04.049 
how does it mean to me when in fact our decisions are affecting thousands of generations that follow us?

88
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:16.159 
And I say thousands because you must remember that each of us are the product of thousands of generations who have sacrificed

89
00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:28.100 
who really thought about what they wanted to do, so that we here could be sitting here talking like this. Thousands of

90
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.440 
lives for each one of you

91
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.049 
and I challenge - do you want to be the weak link in that chain?

92
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:56.840 
I'm very, very pleased to be here in Germany because these are the themes of the German G7 presidency.

93
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.460 
Progress to an equitable world.

94
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:09.970 
The themes that I heard In the last two days, it's not about just economic growth, it's about social justice.

95
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.960 
Let me go back to the plastics issue.

96
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:22.820 
You know, there's a whole big recycling thing and we separate other plastics in the United States, the separated out plastics

97
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.960 
were exported to china.

98
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:35.429 
The Chinese are supposed to recycle them except because at the time they were very poor, they made very low bids for the

99
00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:48.789 
plastic waste and they couldn't afford to actually clean up the plastics and they just tipped them into the rivers and they

100
00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:52.080 
flowed out into the great garbage pile.

101
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.519 
If we don't address social justice.

102
00:10:55.519 --> 00:11:05.480 
If we don't look at the effect of people on people, people like us, families who are trying to survive, we can't solve the

103
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.659 
problem technically without solving it socially.

104
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:23.500 
But for you, each of you who are Germans you should be very very proud of these themes that Germany is standing

105
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.960 
up to say, "we have to address this".

106
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:39.340 
So, this is a short talk. I'm saying Germany is leading the way,

107
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.559 
there's a role everyone can play.

108
00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:45.360 
And I'm playing it from my place in the United States.

109
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:50.960 
I'm playing it from everything that I'm doing with Asia, with Singapore.

110
00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:56.950 
We've got to use everything we've got. This is the only earth we've got.

111
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:08.200 
So these are the four recommendations and I'll just go to the last one which I think is the most important that we can make

112
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.059 
a difference for the whole world.

113
00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:13.220 
The idea of a clean IT

114
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.649 
label, several people have brought it up.

115
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.730 
You know we have labels for washing machines.

116
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:26.799 
We have labels for our food but what about digital which is going to affect everybody's lives?

117
00:12:26.809 --> 00:12:29.240 
We don't have a label for digital.

118
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.600 
Is it clean?

119
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.960 
Is it ethically produced?

120
00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:37.759 
Does it hurt children?

121
00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:51.110 
We worry about you know clothes being made in child factory, child labor factories but we don't worry about okay we might

122
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:59.460 
be taking the childhood of future generations of people because we use up all the earth's resources in our lifetimes.

123
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.860 
We have to do some things.

124
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.850 
The clean IT

125
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:10.049 
label is the one I want to say, "let's do it! Let's come together."

126
00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:16.740 
HPI can lead the academic research institutions.

127
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.440 
We have to start,

128
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.470 
we've talked earlier about the MOOC on sustainable engineering.

129
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.139 
Imagine if a clean IT

130
00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:39.169 
label would be issued only if 50% of the software developers in that company had taken the online MOOC class.

131
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.250 
Right?

132
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.080 
And we could call it level one. clean IT

133
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:52.750 
Level 1 - 50% of the engineers, developers have taken the online MOOC class. Level 2 - 75%.

134
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.679 
Level 3 - 90%.

135
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.059 
Level 4 - 100%.

136
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.460 
So then where do you procure your software from?

137
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:17.169 
You want to go procure your software from where 100% of the engineers and developers had taken the openHPI.

138
00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:18.460 
MOOC Class.

139
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.470 
That's just the beginning.

140
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.840 
We could do that in 2023.

141
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.509 
ESG

142
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:32.799 
reporting environmental social governance is a great huge issue this year.

143
00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:42.519 
I mean this year right now because all of the hedge funds, the financial managers are saying, "if you don't have ESG

144
00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:51.960 
commitment, if you aren't setting a target, if you aren't making progress to that target, we're not gonna put you in our portfolios".

145
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:52.799 
So guess what?

146
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:59.850 
All the corporations, all all the public corporations of the world are trying to measure ESG.

147
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.529 
But ESG

148
00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:07.539 
is right now subject to a measurement problem,

149
00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:19.639 
as we've just heard. The measurement problem is we don't have good measures and so if we can have better measures

150
00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:21.769 
by setting up a clean IT

151
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:29.360 
label where we improve the measurement and we improved the rigor of the clean IT.

152
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:38.049 
label over the years, then we'll get there we'll get there because everybody knows we need to do it.

153
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.820 
My dear dear friend, Konstantinos Karachalios, I don't know if he's here.

154
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.360 
Oh good!

155
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.399 
IEEE

156
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:51.269 
stands ready.

157
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:56.450 
I chair the sustainability technical committee for this SSIT (Society on Social Implications of Technology).

158
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.570 
For IEEE

159
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.059 
Which is social implications of technology.

160
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:17.809 
We're so ready but we need the intellectual leadership of a powerful country, powerful institution and I want to say

161
00:16:17.809 --> 00:16:19.269 
this and I said this

162
00:16:20.409 --> 00:16:21.649 
SAP

163
00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:27.179 
could be the key to the implementation of the clean IT.

164
00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:35.549 
label because no other company has insight into the whole global supply chain of the world.

165
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.580 
And imagine if the SAP.

166
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.379 
pipes could check, "Okay!"

167
00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:41.299 
Is it clean IT?

168
00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:41.759 
Or not?

169
00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:50.159 
Well that's one way to make sure that more and more companies use the clean IT label.

170
00:16:51.240 --> 00:17:02.769 
So one of the proposals that we made in addition to the Clean IT, this is done by my not for profit people

171
00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:11.900 
centered internet is to set up community climate clubs in all around the world.

172
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:18.880 
And what I am suggesting is that these community climate clubs could be pushing the Clean IT label.

173
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.089 
Could be talking about the IEEE

174
00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:32.859 
ethically aligned design standards and could partner with the Global Design Thinking Alliance which is already going to be

175
00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:40.059 
working on sustainability by design so that there's a movement of sustainable design.

176
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.849 
Then we move to international standards and certification.

177
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.359 
And then climate clubs for all.

178
00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:59.059 
We get to the point where actually using data science for the things that matter to us for humanity for the planet.

179
00:18:04.109 --> 00:18:05.960 
I think this is my last slide. Thank You!

WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.510 
in this week we discussed a lot
of attacks against services

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.400 
that are accessible over the
internet and we discussed attacks

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.480 
against web services. so now we
want to discuss some protective

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.030 
measures. how to use secure the
internet in a secure way.

5
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.180 
the problem of that we will
discuss in this week is the open

6
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:32.260 
transport routes on the internet. when
a user wants to access service.

7
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.020 
when the user wants to
send the message,

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
the data are sent over the internet
of networks and networks.

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.810 
and the data are sent in
a way that everyone

10
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.730 
who has access to
the internet

11
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.940 
has in principle the access to
the data. so as a reminder,

12
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.550 
the dangers are of the data
are: spying on data,

13
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.930 
manipulated on data, the data
are deleted and disruption of

14
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.490 
that services, and
the attackers

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.330 
take control he from
external computer systems

16
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
over users' systems. what is good
news? many of this risk can

17
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.750 
be mitigated or even averted
by a few precautions.

18
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.810 
few precautions should be
done.so it's something like

19
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.930 
hygiene in medicine, there are few rules.
if you follow this rules, around

20
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.940 
89% of these risk
can be prevented.

21
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.130 
First important thing is authentication,
the absence of authentication

22
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.380 
mechanisms is the basic
design of many error

23
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.860 
of various internet protocols.
and it's basic that attackers

24
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.050 
can misuses the protocols that
we already discussed. the

25
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.110 
internet was designed
as a well trusty

26
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.850 
community so there were no
out indication mechanisms.

27
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.050 
with trusted
authentication

28
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.840 
mechanisms, one can ensure that
only trusted users have access

29
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.140 
to the various resources, to data,
service, storage, computer,power.

30
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.850 
so as a provider, one
should consider

31
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.250 
that when you insist in an strong
authentication of the user,.

32
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.940 
as a user, one also should insist
on a strong authentication

33
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.860 
of service. strong authentication
is a very important safeguard

34
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.660 
in the internet.

35
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.570 
so use of strong authentication
methods should not

36
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.040 
be restricted to one or
two protocol layers,

37
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.990 
it should be done on
each protocol layer.

38
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.490 
from the internet protocols
to the application layer,

39
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.250 
up to the application, and it
enables the secure identification

40
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.160 
of the identity of the user
or the origin of a query.

41
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.070 
it helps us to find out if they have
the rights and what are the right

42
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.260 
the user has. so is not only
identification of the identity,

43
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.190 
but also authentication of
it's rights. so strong

44
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.290 
authentication might
insist in a multi-factor

45
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.850 
authentication. or in authentication
with digital certificates.

46
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.000 
about both methods we
already discussed.

47
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.290 
multi-fact of authentications for
example by means of smart card,

48
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.150 
with a PIN, or
digital certificate

49
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.790 
from a trustworthy authority. This
gives the partners in an internet

50
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.170 
communication the
knowledge of

51
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.000 
who is the partner, who
has communication done

52
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.640 
with what person. then we speak about
the internet layer and authentication

53
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.570 
on the internet layer.
there is a protection

54
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.780 
IPsec, which secure the
internet protocol

55
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.080 
by means of secure
authentication and encryption.

56
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:39.060 
IPsec protocol encrypt the
data packets and provides

57
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.190 
mechanisms for
authentication. so the

58
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.850 
new IP protocol
PIv6 supports

59
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.400 
authentication
from the outset.

60
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.240 
for the other internet protocol,
for the online protocol

61
00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.750 
that by him or herself,
IPsec is installed

62
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.660 
for using of IPv6, this
is the integral part.

63
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.210 
when we speak about protection
on the transport layer,

64
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.730 
the internet layers who is
responsible for the data

65
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.040 
packe. for the transport layer, it
is responsible for establishing

66
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.760 
connections, which here
means the use of TLS/SSL

67
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.240 
for authentication

68
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.150 
by means of a digital
certificates. and this is

69
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.820 
a integral part of the
using https protocol.

70
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.100 
the "s" indicates that the http
protocol, the web protocol are

71
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.260 
used on the base of
TLS/SSL connection.

72
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.310 
when we speak speak about
the protection on the

73
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.750 
application layer. on
the application layer,

74
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.160 
one should use end-to-end
authentication by means of digital

75
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.470 
certificates. for example a
emails using the application

76
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.630 
by PGP or SMIME
protocols.

77
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.340 
for securing and for providing
means for authentication,

78
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.290 
one should use multi-factor
authentication. for example,

79
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.520 
with one time passwords, with
smart tokens, or with biometric

80
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.290 
factors. these authentications,
the other things,

81
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.010 
when generally can be done is
encryption. encryption keeps data and

82
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.070 
messages secret and keeps that
secret from third parties.

83
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.330 
and simply, the idea behind
encryption is to make the data

84
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.450 
unreadable by the user. it
looks like a senseless text.

85
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.430 
therefore encrypt
sensitive data as soon

86
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.480 
as it is to be transmitted over
an open network like the

87
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.570 
internet. because the
transport channels

88
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
can be accessed
principally by everyone.

89
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.360 
so the encryption of
sensitive data before

90
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.790 
transmitting data is
very important.

91
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.440 
three commendation here
is to use hybrid

92
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.420 
encryption. we'll speak

93
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.690 
it in course week five in details
about different encryption methods,

94
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.770 
and also about hybrid encryption. so next
week you will know more about this.

95
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.330 
there are two types of
encryption. two key

96
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.320 
encryption, one key encryption.
and the both have difficulties.

97
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.100 
the two key encryption
is very good,

98
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.570 
it is usable for the
exchange of the encryption

99
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.440 
key, but it's quite more complicated
than for the data exchange

100
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.770 
one should use one key
encryption method.

101
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.900 
this is what hybrid encryption
means. then use already discussed

102
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.520 
authentication protocols
for the various

103
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.960 
protocols based on
encryption technology.

104
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.780 
we mentioned IPsec,
we mention TLS/SSL,

105
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.600 
we mention PGP/MIME as
the example. then

106
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.270 
use firewalls. we already
discussed firewalls as in

107
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.310 
a excursion if you
have the last week.

108
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.580 
to some extent, the malicious network
connections can be prevented

109
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.560 
by means of those firewalls, they
cannot prevent all but they

110
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.060 
can considered as an additional
help to prevent this.

111
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.900 
the firewalls are only connections
to services so it should

112
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.480 
be accessible from the outside. so
one can installs this, one can

113
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.990 
define such firewalls rules so
that only connections can

114
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.150 
be established to service
that should be accessible.

115
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.580 
do not allow outgoing
connections without

116
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.090 
explicit permissions. the reason
is, if your allow this, then an

117
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:26.370 
attacker which is able to
install malicious code

118
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.840 
on your computer, for
example, to make it a bot,

119
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:35.800 
in a botnet, this software
needs to communicate with

120
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.850 
attacker, needs to communicate
with the common&amp; control server

121
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.840 
in a botnet. and if
you do not allow

122
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:52.370 
the external connection, than the
bot cannot get contact with

123
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.280 
the comment&amp; controls server,
and then he cannot performance

124
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.020 
attack. so do not allow
outgoing connection without

125
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.530 
explicit permission.
and this can be

126
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:09.300 
specified in a firewall.
another service is

127
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.540 
generally no unnecessary
services should be used.

128
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.970 
firewalls block access to services
from none trusted networks.

129
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.930 
this is their mission,
and he even better,

130
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.260 
you should only installed
services on your computer, your

131
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.740 
smartphone you are really
using and needing.

132
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.560 
the reason is that each of the
service has vulnerabilities,

133
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.020 
there are explored. and if they
are on your system services

134
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.770 
you do not use then the
vulnerabilities of that service

135
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:54.030 
will increase their danger on
your system can be attacked.

136
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.490 
for example, by means of this
service so it's not necessarily

137
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.420 
to installed. then,
very very important

138
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.810 
rule with protecting
internet security is

139
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.140 
to update regularly
your system.

140
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.400 
most attacks on the internet
exploit (known) vulnerabilities.

141
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.010 
even the zero

142
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.950 
knowledge are only known to
small number of people,

143
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.460 
but as soon as at the vulnerabilities
becomes known to the public,

144
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:37.290 
then software provider
a very much duty

145
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.180 
to design a updates
which helps

146
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.540 
to make the exploiting of this
vulnerability impossible.

147
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.010 
so it means as soon as
software developers

148
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.990 
discover errors and weaknesses
in their software,

149
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.130 
they develop so-called
patches or updates. and

150
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:03.500 
when you installs as updates,
then the arrows are eliminated

151
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.490 
and the vulnerabilities are closed. so
it is not more possible to attack

152
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:14.150 
your system by these vulnerabilities.
therefore, a very important protective

153
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.570 
measure is to check regularly for
new updates and install them

154
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.130 
promptly. so you know which kind
of systems you are using.

155
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.980 
look up for the systems if there
is new patches available

156
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.590 
or an updates
is available.

157
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.570 
then you should install
them, by the way

158
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.440 
the system which is installed on
yourcomputer, you do not know

159
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.760 
you will forget to look for updates,
so those are really dangerous

160
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.480 
services which are unused, unneeded
and which are installed in the

161
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:55.890 
systems. this is the last thing
you should avoid to have this.

162
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.400 
by the way, our institute HPI
provides a free service:

163
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:09.040 
HPI-VDB, this service should help
you to find vulnerabilities

164
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.910 
into software programs on your
system. so this is the web address

165
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:20.970 
of service
https://hpi-vdb.de.

166
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.880 
in the moment when

167
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.480 
you connect to the system, press the
self- diagnosis, run the program

168
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:38.020 
and the result is displayed
for you. here is an example

169
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:43.340 
it shows the
vulnerabilities,

170
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:48.670 
which are known and it classifies
them in low security,

171
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.290 
medium security and the
red, high security.

172
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.050 
these vulnerabilities we have
connected in the services, we

173
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.260 
take it from all the sources that
are available over the internet.

174
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:10.230 
then the self service checks which
systems have vulnerabilities and

175
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.370 
run on your system and
then it's also displayed

176
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.610 
of whether the vulnerabilities
is serious on your

177
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.520 
system or not. so I invite you to
try out this information and

178
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.310 
to check your
own computer.

179
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.480 
when we speak about protection
measures so we have to speak

180
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.940 
about sandboxing and
minimal authorizations.

181
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.990 
however, the updates
and firewalls alone

182
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.280 
cannot account act all
threats from the internet.

183
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:50.140 
so therefore we recommend open
web pages and internet services

184
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.950 
in a specialized protected
environment. It is sandbox.

185
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.610 
even if there is malicious
things, it's not possible

186
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.920 
for the software to excess the
resources outside the sandbox

187
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.000 
in your system. and the next
thing is you should execute

188
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.220 
this services with lowest
possible privileges.

189
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.930 
because the lowest
privilege is less rights

190
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:28.470 
to excess or to use resources.
browsers also a often open

191
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.080 
every page in their own sandbox.
Thus, malicious web services

192
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.210 
only have access

193
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.470 
to highly limited
execution environment

194
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:45.680 
of the sandbox. and also
some antivirus programs

195
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.670 
make it possible to run all
applications in a sandbox.

196
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.470 
so here you should look at what
kind of and the virus software

197
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.910 
runs on your system which
provides this functionality.

198
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.950 
a general trend is, withdrawal
from administrator

199
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.030 
accounts with which
everything can be done,

200
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.060 
setting up of restricted
user accounts. even

201
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.780 
if it's your own computer
there is also possibility

202
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.900 
that attacker takes access to your
computer. because you run your system

203
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.690 
with adminstrator
rights. in this way,

204
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.650 
the attacker can access
to very serious

205
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.970 
data or service of
functionality.

206
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:39.650 
last point for protecting your
system, for protecting your

207
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:44.110 
life in the virtual world
is data minimisation.

208
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.510 
habit and problem of many
service operators is

209
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.770 
that they store too much
data. and the reason is:

210
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:57.370 
"maybe it the data can be
used at a later stage".

211
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:03.790 
so many of personal
data are around.

212
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.010 
what's the security risk?
the security risk is

213
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.170 
that in the event of a
security incident,

214
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.960 
for example if an attacker
is able to break

215
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.000 
in a system of the
service provider,

216
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.630 
then all data says service
provider has collected

217
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.410 
fall into the hands of
the data thieves.

218
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.870 
and you are not aware this,
your data which you

219
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.100 
gave to the service,
are now in the hand

220
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.840 
of data thieves and
can be misused.

221
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:44.570 
so users and service operators
must exercise the principle

222
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:50.900 
of data economy. that means:
specifying and storing only the

223
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.460 
data that is really needed
to provide a service.

224
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.040 
you should be critical
whether it's needed to give

225
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.410 
the data to the
service provider.

226
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.090 
if you have the feeling that the
service provider does not need

227
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.260 
this to provides a
service for you.

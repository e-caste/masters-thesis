00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.099 
Hello, my name is Elke Kunde, I'm from IBM and I'm acting

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.929 
in the role of the Blockchain, Technical Focal Point for the Dutch region, Germany,

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.549 
Austria and Switzerland. And I'm happy to give you an overview of

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.919 
blockchain for business today.

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.149 
So, the agenda is a little vocabulary training, what is blockchain for business?

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.649 
Give you an overview of the IBM blockchain strategy, what we are doing,

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.539 
which product, solutions, and services we have to serve clients

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.129 
in the blockchain in area. To give you an overview of some use cases

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.919 
we have and selected references.

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.650 
We also have lessons learned after 500 blockchain project

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.149 
s, we published a little booklet, I'll guide you about the highlights

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.159 
of that and some predictions about blockchain adoptions in the

13
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.840 
coming months and years.

14
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.019 
OK, let's start. So, why should we use a blockchain?

15
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.649 
Why do we need it? So databases are here for decades and

16
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.869 
longer to store data.

17
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.369 
The problem for database is it's centralized and everybody needs to

18
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.989 
trust the administrator for managing the database and typically a

19
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.699 
database is not immutable. You can change records there and

20
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.549 
for provenance, who did what, who changed what?

21
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.369 
It's usually not building.

22
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.959 
So, one using a database in a distributed environment among multiple

23
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.579 
parties, you could choose distributed

24
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.139 
databases, but it does not solve the trust issue because then

25
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.609 
you multiply the problem by having multiple copies to worry about

26
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.810 
and more administrators.

27
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.469 
And blockchain is supposed to allow the concept of a distributed database

28
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.889 
to be deployed across an untrusted network.

29
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.850 
And this is something which a traditional database cannot handle.

30
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.099 
Blockchain will fundamentally change business processes.

31
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.019 
If you look at today's transactions between enterprises,

32
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.539 
if Part A sells something to Party B, they both are processing these transactions

33
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.669 
in their own I.T.

34
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.559 
They are notifying the banks if it's a regulated industry, there are auditors

35
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.779 
or the authorities and every one of the messages are sent point-to-point

36
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.249 
and as long as everybody's same sense, the same content of the message, everything is all

37
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.079 
right. But if somebody changes the value by error,

38
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.227 
then an expensive and manual

39
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.349 
clearing process starts on who has the truth.

40
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.299 
So, blockchain will change that by connecting those enterprises digitally

41
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.699 
to a blockchain network.

42
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.409 
A blockchain is a decentralized database where everybody, every

43
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.479 
participant in the network has its own copy of the ledger.

44
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.309 
And if Party A sells something to Party B, they are supposing a transaction

45
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.009 
that gets digitally signed, verified by the other participants

46
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.659 
and if it's validated, then it gets appended to that ledger.

47
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.322 
And by that, it is a timestamp process, it's an

48
00:03:26.323 --> 00:03:28.439 
append-onlya zero process.

49
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.759 
So there's built-ininformation about provenance.

50
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.849 
It's an immutable concept. I'll explain that later.

51
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.439 
And you get a very near time finality, a response that

52
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.160 
your transaction has been completed.

53
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.009 
There are different types of blockchains, it all started with Bitcoin.

54
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.385 
You probably heard about that, it's a public blockchain, a

55
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.909 
so-called cryptocurrency.

56
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.379 
It was invented to send money from A to B without

57
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.849 
any banks, without any authorities, and nobody should be able to stop

58
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.020 
you. It's anonymous on purpose and

59
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.509 
it's resource intensive because to validate

60
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.159 
transaction in an anonymous environment, they needed a consensus

61
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.079 
protocol which guarantees that nobody can

62
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.619 
hide a majority in an anonymous space.

63
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.079 
And this is the so-called consensus protocol, proof of work, which has a cryptographic

64
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.399 
kind of riddle to solve for those building a block.

65
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.859 
And so blockchain was deemed to be very energy-intensive,

66
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.319 
was having an energy resource consumption, which complete

67
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320 
countries have.

68
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.029 
But this was the beginning, and it was 10 years ago, so blockchain

69
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.559 
technology has progressed and there are other blockchains around,

70
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.999 
there's variety. There is no 'the' blockchain there's a blockchain

71
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.889 
technology, which is the same and that's a common goal, all blockchains

72
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.629 
aim to provide an irrefutable proof that a set of transactions occurred

73
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.759 
between participants.

74
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.679 
We are focusing on blockchains for business and they are generally

75
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.329 
commissioned in private, meaning, you have an identity, you know

76
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.600 
it's not anonymous, you know who you are dealing with.

77
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.559 
You do not have those expensive consensus protocols

78
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.389 
as you work with identities, you can have smarter protocols

79
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.069 
like form decisions and we do not have built-in crypto

80
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.839 
currencies, we are dealing with asset, whether it's a cryptocurrency or something

81
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.889 
completely else.

82
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.869 
So what is a blockchain, as I said,

83
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.489 
it's for transaction processing and

84
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.589 
it's append-only. So, if you're doing a transaction, you're

85
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.659 
proposing it to the network and if it's appended

86
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.159 
somehow and this is implementation specific, a

87
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.719 
block is built, it's finalized, and this can be every 10

88
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.099 
minutes, time-based, it can be every X transactions, whatever.

89
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.899 
So, the technology differs, but everybody is building a block

90
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.369 
somewhere, somehow, and then all the transactions in that

91
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.829 
block get a cryptographic checksum, the so-called hash, and then the block is finalized.

92
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.589 
The block itself with all its contents, gets also a cryptographic

93
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.239 
checksum, a hash. I mean, a new block is built or

94
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.159 
opened, then it gets the number and the hash of the previous block

95
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.189 
as the first entry in the next block.

96
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.959 
So, you have a woven checksum, which means

97
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.209 
if I was a hacker and would change the transaction, the transaction

98
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.979 
hash is no longer valid, the block hash is no longer valid and the

99
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.729 
following block also could detect that there's something wrong.

100
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.949 
And this makes a blockchain immutable because changes

101
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.199 
are immediately detected.

102
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.759 
The requirements of a blockchain for business as

103
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.409 
and contrary to the so-called public block chain, which were

104
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.999 
mostly early block chains.

105
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.549 
The participants decide which assets, which transaction, which information

106
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.369 
of the transaction they would like to share.

107
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.869 
It's not like in a public blockchain that all the transactions are open and readable by

108
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.939 
any participant.

109
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.499 
They are choosing what to share and its identity so the participants know who

110
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.500 
they're dealing with.

111
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.882 
And the transaction endorsement as the participants

112
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.089 
give approval for endorsement because you are working with identities.

113
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:14.729 
So, you know who has endorsed a particular transaction.

114
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.249 
And information is shared. via need-to-know.

115
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.349 
So, there is on the one hand, very granular privacy,

116
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.119 
if you would like to have it and for regulators, there is an optional role

117
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.079 
of a regulator who can see all of the transactions.

118
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.095 
So, information is shared via need-to-know.

119
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.189 
Let's have a look at the IBM blockchain strategy.

120
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.937 
Where and how are we involved in blockchain space.

121
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.129 
So, we have contributed a former, our own blockchain implementation

122
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.569 
into an open-sourcecollaborative project led by

123
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.271 
the Linux Foundation called Hyperledger.

124
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.849 
We are building blockchain in a collaborative open-source mode with other enterprises.

125
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.304 
Based on the Hyperledger blockchain implementations, we are building a

126
00:09:04.305 --> 00:09:08.819 
platform, a blockchain as a service platform in the IBM cloud, which allows

127
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.409 
you to develop governance and operate your enterprise blockchain network for speed

128
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.029 
and security. Based on the platform, we are offering block

129
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.539 
chain based solutions for critical industry challenges.

130
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.299 
We are building and fostering ecosystems to bring this multiparty networks

131
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.039 
together and of course there's a wealth of IBM services,

132
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.899 
starting with technical support, going over the garage service to

133
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.759 
implement first-use cases and all of the IBM Global Business Services

134
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.349 
with implementing blockchain applications, developing them, integrating existing

135
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.860 
system, extending them with other technologies and so on.

136
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.324 
So, let's talk about Hyperledger.

137
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.109 
As I said, it's a project governed by the Linux Foundation and

138
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.479 
we are a proud founding member in February 2016.

139
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.189 
It started with 17 enterprises, now it has grown

140
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.549 
to over 260 member organizations.

141
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.649 
It's an open-sourceconcept, it wants to implement

142
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.299 
and develop open standards and it has an open governance model.

143
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.069 
And it has, in addition to a technical working stream, which is clearly

144
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:31.439 
in every open source project, also a governance board,

145
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.329 
which is a governance

146
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.299 
board that invites

147
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.349 
other enterprises for use cases, they want to

148
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.350 
establish blockchain implementations.

149
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.369 
And there's no one Hyperledger, two years ago, if you said,

150
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.929 
I'm doing my blockchain with Hyperledger, everybody thought they knew which

151
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.849 
implementation you're on.

152
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.299 
Now Hyperledger has 5 blockchain frameworks

153
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.179 
in incubation and two of them graduated and

154
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.949 
6 tools now for a modular approach

155
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.929 
to the blockchain world.

156
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.509 
So, the first implementation which graduated as

157
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.419 
Hyperledger 'Fabric'. This is where IBM is building upon.

158
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.469 
The second was Hyperledger Sawtooth,

159
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.609 
which has a new consensus model called Proof of Elapsed

160
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:43.499 
Time. There's Hyperledger Iroha for blockchain

161
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.059 
implementation with a very small footprint, so it's

162
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.169 
suitable, for example, for mobile usage

163
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:58.379 
and there's Indy for self-sovereignidentities,

164
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.839 
and Hyperledger Burrow as an integration option where

165
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.579 
Fabric and Sawtooh, for example, can execute code

166
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.450 
originally built for Ethereum for Ethereum Virtual Machine.

167
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.719 
There are tools around, like Hyperledger Composer, to model the blockchain

168
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.799 
networks, define participants, assets, and transactions.

169
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.049 
Hyperledger Explorer as a developer tool to have a deep look inside

170
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.341 
the blockchain. Hyperledger Quilt for

171
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.969 
interoperability. Hyperledger Cello as a service deployment,

172
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:45.219 
and Hyperledger Caliper as a blockchain framework for benchmark's -benchmarking,

173
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.239 
comparing blockchains, and scaling.

174
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.460 
And the newest one is Hyperledger Ursa.

175
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.609 
Hyperledger decided to have all the cryptographic modules

176
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.879 
into one project, a separate project, and used in

177
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.489 
a modular way by the other projects.

178
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.270 
The one-stopfor cryptographic libraries.

179
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.209 
As I said, we are mainly using Hyperledger Fabric within IBM, this

180
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.459 
is a basis for our IBM blockchain platform as of now,

181
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.551 
it's graduated in mid-2017

182
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.013 
and it's now version 1.4.

183
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.739 
The IBM blockchain platform, blockchainas a service, originally built

184
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.219 
on the IBM cloud, but now extending.

185
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.019 
What they are doing here is, we are using Hyperledger

186
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.489 
Fabric as our implementation for blockchain to

187
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:58.019 
operate. We are using hyperlexia composer for the development

188
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.969 
tools and we have written a lot of add-on operational tools,

189
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.009 
dashboards, monitoring for

190
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.509 
all the governance issues to handle in a multiparty environment like

191
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.059 
voting processes, etc..

192
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.689 
And recently we extended it for on-premiseusage, so

193
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.179 
we can have the IBM blockchain platform on the IBM cloud private, if you want to

194
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.739 
have your IBM blockchain network part

195
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.329 
on-premise. And the blockchain peers

196
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.450 
can be on the Amazon cloud,

197
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.139 
more offerings to come here.

198
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.709 
Having a look into the IBM blockchain platform, some people

199
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.479 
say, well, it's all the IBM administrator, so what's decentralized here in that?

200
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.009 
And as I said, we have built-ingovernance

201
00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:01.019 
tools to enable a multiparty network and a multiparty

202
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:06.149 
governance. So, we have, for example, the role of the network service provider

203
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.679 
who is governing the network to ordering service, does the onboarding

204
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.859 
and spawning of participants and network service consumer.

205
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.779 
They are operating the blockchain nodes, the so-called peers and the certificate

206
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.729 
authority. So the business service provider

207
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:29.189 
responsible for the application part of the blockchain, the so-called Smart Contracts

208
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.639 
chain codes to be deployed on the block chain.

209
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.199 
There's the business service consumer who hosts the application server

210
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.850 
for the application and integration logic and of course, there's an end-user.

hello this is jin jin. i'm a senior sicentist at Amazon.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.670 
this work is round how to use machine learning\data

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.100 
science to discover computational cognitive model of learning to assist

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.710 
learning design. so what is a cognitive model of learning. it

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.100 
is a descriptive accounts or computational representation of

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.470 
human thinking about a given concept skill or domain. it includes

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.910 
both a way of organizing knowledge within the subject syria

8
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.530 
and an account of how humans develop accurate and complete

9
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.490 
knowledge of their subject syria.

10
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.920 
why discovering such model is difficult? traditionally learning

11
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.580 
designers engage in a variety of practices to unpack knowledge

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.770 
from subject matter experts and novices to develop such cognitive

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.310 
mode of learning and use those models to guide the design of

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.150 
instruction or instructional technologies.
the process of eliciting and organizing knowledge

15
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.150 
such as cognitive task analysis is labor-intensive and requires specific expertise

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.220 
that many designers do not have.

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.440 
luckily the learning data the system collects might be able

18
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.260 
to provide another perspective on how learning is happening

19
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.850 
and how to model the cognitive process. thus, in this paper we

20
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.410 
propose a framework that includes a variational our encoder

21
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.780 
and a gaussian its model to discover the cognitive model of learning

22
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.320 
in a computational manner.

23
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.630 
so the overall framework looks like this.

24
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.380 
the learner interacts with online learning system
the system collects the data,

25
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.230 
especially the learner assessment correctness data and we apply

26
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.170 
behavior analysis here the variational our encoder a factorization

27
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.380 
to learn the assessment representation. representation embeds

28
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.960 
the pedals learners have during learning includes the degree of difficulty

29
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.840 
the sequential othering patterns.

30
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.260 
and then reply the gaussian mixture model for an auto class

31
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.310 
rainn to discover the cognitive model tony.

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.700 
the hypothesis here is that assessments within the same kc

33
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.280 
share the same task complexity. and the pedals learners have

34
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.380 
on performing tasks indicating the complexity of the task,

35
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.390 
thus the cursory step on the task representation the task patterns

36
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.060 
is able to discover called model of learning.

37
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.080 
here task and assessment is used interchangeably.

38
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.070 
at the end we provide the discovered coq model of learning

39
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.770 
to designers for courseware improvement.

40
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.930 
alright for more details please refer to the paper.
thanks for watching.

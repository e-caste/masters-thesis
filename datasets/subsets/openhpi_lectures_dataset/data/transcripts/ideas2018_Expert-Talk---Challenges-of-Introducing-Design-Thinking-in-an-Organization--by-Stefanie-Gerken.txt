00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.780 
Hi, I'm Stefanie Gerken and I'm
a design thinking specialist

2
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.580 
coach and practitioner. Before I
started working in education,

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.890 
I was responsible for the
implementation of design thinking,

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.140 
including the associated
strategic cultural change,

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.720 
in a mid-sized software
company from 2013 to

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.700 
2016. The whole idea of
design thinking at this

7
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.640 
company arose from its CEO, who
was part of a design thinking

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720 
workshop and realised the
potential for his own company.

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.060 
After a test run, if design
thinking is a good fit,

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.500 
the CEO searched for someone to
bring in design thinking across

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.900 
all aspects of the company.
Hence here I am.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.780 
Initially I was asked to organise,
lead and coach three different

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.660 
projects over six months. One project
was about further developing

14
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.400 
the software. Another project
was about rethinking the sales

15
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.030 
program and the third project
was about redesigning the

16
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.610 
office space. As you can imagine,
there were also some challenges

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
during this journey.

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.960 
The main challenge we were facing
was the size of the company.

19
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.320 
With around 25 people, it's
difficult to assign certain

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.120 
people to a project for more
than a couple of hours

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.860 
per week, as their regular work
needs to be done as well.

22
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.080 
A very good strategic approach
for forming a team is to call

23
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.200 
upon volunteers who are
interested in a certain topic.

24
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.260 
When I started in the very
beginning at this company I gave

25
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.880 
an intro with the design thinking
fast forward, for all employees,

26
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.690 
so that everyone got in touch
with the rough idea of design

27
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.410 
thinking at least once. The goal
was to include everyone over

28
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.250 
a longer period in one or the
other project. But as I said we

29
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.380 
always kept it voluntary. Some
colleagues were more interested

30
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.290 
than others, but we never found
it hard to form a team.

31
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.530 
It did get rather tricky in bringing
them together the same day

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.190 
at the same time, but
with lots of planning,

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.840 
like considering holidays,
company events, and many ad hoc

34
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.080 
things, we were able to have
around two hour slots per week,

35
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.900 
per project. Some of the people
were engaged into two projects

36
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.390 
or more, which resulted
in a high workload.

37
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.180 
Realising this halfway through,
we agreed that we had to cut

38
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.170 
down the people's involvement
in one or the other team

39
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.050 
or assign them other roles,
such as a project owner or

40
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.980 
expert to consult for certain
aspects instead of being part

41
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.290 
of the team full time.

42
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.760 
If you start as a design thinking
specialist at a mid-sized

43
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.500 
company, this might mean that
you're responsible for

44
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
everything that is somehow
connected to design thinking.

45
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.110 
Organising and scheduling
people and tasks,

46
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.840 
also briefing customers for
interviews and testing, documenting

47
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.330 
all results, planning next
steps, coaching the team,

48
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.180 
being part of the team when
they were stuck or too

49
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.100 
superficial, or they need to speed
up in implementing results

50
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.000 
of some projects in the end.
Results of redesigning the office

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.510 
space and also redesigning
the part of program,

52
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.500 
was an opportunity to convert
ideas into actual outcomes

53
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.830 
that I was responsible for. This
led into a timely not-limited

54
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.160 
full-time position. I then undertook
the role of a design thinking

55
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.010 
specialist as well as a
global channel manager,

56
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.410 
which also made sense for
the size of the company,

57
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.670 
as we cut down the number of
design thinking projects running

58
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.540 
in parallel. When there were no
design thinking related projects

59
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.230 
to be done I was in charge
of trade partners matters.

60
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.940 
We wanted to make sure that design
thinking was not only project

61
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.130 
based but something that is actually
beneficial throughout the

62
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.010 
whole work day. We restructured
the office space so that people

63
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.180 
responsible for different areas
where either sitting close

64
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.540 
together or had to cross
each other's paths.

65
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.750 
We also had a dedicated design thinking
room with flexible furniture

66
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.080 
to adapt the room to people's
needs. Everyone was allowed

67
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.890 
to work in this room and
spend time there as needed.

68
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.440 
I also became something like a
suggestion, sometimes also complaints

69
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.960 
box, as colleagues realized that
with design thinking your

70
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.690 
work very much focused on the human,
so why not actually include

71
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.980 
their own thoughts and concerns more
and not only focus on customers'

72
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.450 
or partners' needs. In my role as
a design thinking specialist

73
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.580 
I was not assigned to a
particular department

74
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.190 
but rather connected to projects,
so I was able to freely exchange

75
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.880 
with everyone in the company.
I was able to drop aspects

76
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.190 
of peoples' needs as a
conversation starter.

77
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.790 
We then turned this into a
bi-weekly sharing session

78
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.490 
to exchange our different projects,
successes, but also failures

79
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.090 
and see how we might solve and
strengthen our open communication

80
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.580 
and inspire others. Many wishes
and needs were communicated

81
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.510 
but we also had to stay realistic
and make a strategic plan

82
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.070 
how to make things happen instead
of turning the company upside

83
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.330 
down within one week. Doing
all changes in a Kaizen

84
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.710 
way - to change one thing
after each other and improve

85
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.990 
those changes until they fit
- worked for everyone.

86
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.180 
There were many challenges over
the years, however having the

87
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.840 
CEO's buy-in, who is convinced of
its power and actively supports

88
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.030 
it, was a trust provider for employees
and made the cultural change

89
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.720 
possible. Employees are human
and they create the success

90
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.950 
of the company. If you want to
make change happen in your

91
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.610 
company and you want to use
design thinking for it,

92
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.810 
don't forget about people,
otherwise it will not work.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.230 
My name is Falk and today we are talking about setting the strategy for design,

2
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.290 
and as always I would like to introduce youto the learning

3
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.960 
objectives and then where we are in the program.

4
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.560 
So let's talk about the learning objectives for today,

5
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.910 
the first point that we want to address is to talk about the

6
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
main drivers for design thinking on a strategic level,

7
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.620 
and as we have introduced already we would like to share some

8
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.460 
results of our recent study that we have conducted here at HPI

9
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.430 
together with global leading organizations and we are sharing

10
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.150 
insights on what the main drivers are and what you could learn from them.

11
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
Secondly, I would like to talk more intensively about the critical

12
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.560 
success factors and also inhibitors for setting such strategies in organizations.

13
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.410 
As always let's have a quick look at the design-thinking implementation wheel.

14
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
You got already familiar with it as part of the introduction

15
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.160 
and today we want to touch the first dimension offered, i.e. vision and strategy

16
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
and in that regard we want to talk about in detail what the

17
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.000 
content of such strategy could look like and how you can instrumentalize those

18
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.740 
contents to your own organization. So let's jump into the details.

19
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.180 
What are the key objectives that were usually set as part of such strategies?

20
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.110 
and as part of our qualitative research we have identified

21
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.830 
7 core dimensions that are important for setting a design thinking strategy.

22
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.530 
Let's have a look at the first one, the first one is that most organizations

23
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.420 
use design thinking to develop new products and services so

24
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.490 
this was the most mentioned dimension for setting a strategy around design thinking.

25
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.730 
To address this important topic and this has to do with the

26
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.490 
second dimension which we have identified, which is bringing

27
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.970 
in the customer and human centered focus.

28
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.830 
So those organizations who take these two elements as part of the strategy

29
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.230 
they want to implement are more user-centred, more human-centered innovations

30
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.560 
as part of their product and service roadmap.

31
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.120 
The third dimension that we have qualified and identified

32
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
is agility, and I'm sure this is not unfamiliar with you because

33
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.910 
agility is driving our businesses more and more nowadays because of digitization

34
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.250 
and design thinking is also seen as one agent methodology in

35
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.680 
the front-end of innovation and is helping to become more faster, more adaptable

36
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.760 
to changes in the market environment, and therefore a lot of

37
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.260 
organizations also attached this strategic goal to design thinking initiatives.

38
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:18.100 
On a fourth step, organizations are also relating creativity to design thinking

39
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.000 
to foster creativity, to set empathy, and collaboration

40
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.110 
within the organization as part of a design thinking implementation.

41
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.260 
And this is true because design thinking as you know is helping

42
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.750 
you to unleash the creative potential of your teams in organizations and therefore,

43
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.750 
creating you to boost the flow of ideas and a ramping up and pumping up

44
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.850 
your products with with such ideas.

45
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.340 
The fifth dimension that is usually attached to design thinking strategies

46
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.240 
is building up design capabilities,

47
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.240 
and this might be new to you but the intention for such

48
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.480 
organizations who use this as a strategic driver is that they

49
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.110 
want to have this mentality, the philosophy of design thinking and of design

50
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.720 
attached to the organization for a long time. So it's nothing that they have

51
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.740 
been in mind for addressing in the next few days or weeks or

52
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.630 
months, but they want to have design thinking as a driver for

53
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.870 
nurturing and sticking design capabilities inside the

54
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.410 
organization for long term.

55
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.210 
So then one other dimension that was sometimes mentioned, not

56
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.650 
very often but sometimes, is leveraging the business impact of design.

57
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.110 
So design from its origins is also driving business impact

58
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.410 
by creating products that have a better usability and acceptance rate and

59
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.150 
that provide better experiences to users, and therefore, some

60
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.210 
organizations use this leveraging criteria to

61
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.320 
set the strategy. And lastly,

62
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.900 
a lot of organizations he told us that besides all the creative

63
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.180 
aspects of design thinking and innovation aspects of design thinking,

64
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.790 
they are using also the talent perspective for gaining into attracting

65
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.650 
new employees for the organization as a strategic motivation for design thinking.

66
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.830 
Because more and more young people know that design thinking is

67
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.560 
also seen as a new innovative work style, that is helping them

68
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.400 
to embrace their own creativity and therefore design thinking

69
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.180 
can also be used on a strategic level to attract new talent for organizations.

70
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.690 
So let's have a look at the main drivers for design-thinking

71
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.640 
initiatives on a strategic level. And based on our recent study

72
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.460 
that we have conducted with over five hundred people globally,

73
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.800 
we have identified 2 main drivers that set to stage for design thinking

74
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.720 
with 26% is creating new products and this is a basically

75
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.140 
attached to the idea that organizations have to explore

76
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.700 
more new fields instead of just exploiting what they have already.

77
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.390 
The second is a strategic main driver that they have said and

78
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.900 
this was mentioned around 23% as part of this study

79
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.900 
into a new working culture, into new work philosophy,

80
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.100 
and design thinking is seen as a catalyst to enable those transformational

81
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.300 
processes that needs to happen in organizations.

82
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.790 
So further we asked as part of this study what are the strategic

83
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.500 
outcomes that you can achieve with design thinking? The strategic

84
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.200 
outcomes are many fold and some of them are obvious and some

85
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.510 
of them are surprising. So let me guide you through

86
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.590 
the more obvious ones are and also the highest scores

87
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:36.150 
on were given to them, is that design thinking makes the innovation processes more efficient.

88
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.490 
So this was the intention from the beginning on that innovation is

89
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.720 
getting boosted with design thinking and this is also seen

90
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.530 
by the majority of organizations who have participated in that study.

91
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:57.410 
Further on, and this is confirmed here with this study, design thinking is indeed

92
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.500 
helping to improve the working culture and especially if you

93
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.800 
look at the comparison between the results from 2015

94
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.790 
and the 2020 study, you see that

95
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.100 
both dimensions still score very high, and managers inside such organizations

96
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:21.820 
attaching these two dimensions to the strategic outcomes of design thinking.

97
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.910 
But let me highlight what is may be surprising,

98
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.240 
and interesting, and what also changed over the years.

99
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.900 
If you look at the dimension that design thinking is helping

100
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:39.100 
organizations to save costs, we had a very moderate agreement

101
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.650 
in 2015,

102
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.150 
if you now look at the numbers in 2020 you

103
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.190 
can see that the agreement has almost doubled.

104
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.190 
And it's half of the agreement of the other two before mentioned dimensions.

105
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.560 
This is interesting, so design thinking is not just seen as

106
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.500 
a tool anymore, which is only spring creativity and is helping to become innovative,

107
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.500 
now it's also seen as a method which is helping to improve

108
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.500 
innovation processes and also development processes for new products and services.

109
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.540 
By doing so saving costs in the other the dimension that is

110
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.590 
related to saving costs, is that design thinking is sometimes

111
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.330 
creating products and services, even new innovative processes

112
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.290 
that also helps saving costs. So that's maybe an interesting

113
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.870 
dimension for you as well, especially when you think about the strategy

114
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.770 
and the strategic goals and outcome for design thinking in these initiatives

115
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.270 
to consider that design thinking might even address this particular

116
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.120 
dimension of cost savings.

117
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.270 
And then lastly if you look into this dimension that

118
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.870 
users are getting more and frequently involved, I think

119
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.500 
here we also see another boost from the 2015

120
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.770 
to 2020 study, that design thinking is helping

121
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.320 
on a factual base involving more customers, involving more

122
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:21.300 
humans, as part of the R&amp;D processes and therefore helping to

123
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.970 
move on with your customer centricity and human centricity initiatives.

124
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.570 
So let's look at the challenges and inhibitors. We also talked to those executives

125
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.580 
and as you can imagine setting up such a strategy with such goals

126
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.690 
is never simple.

127
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.680 
And we identified in total

128
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:48.900 
six dimensions, six challenges and inhibitors that prevent

129
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.530 
setting up such a strategy.

130
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:58.190 
And the most often mentioned inhibitor is attaining the management body,

131
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:04.000 
it's something that always happens and I think you can almost always apply

132
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.940 
this as an inhibitor and challenge to every strategic topics.

133
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.800 
So if you want to move on with design thinking on a strategic level,

134
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.280 
don't forget to pick up the management and don't forget to

135
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.200 
set up the business case for design thinking in your organization.

136
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.450 
And this is what you need to do in order to

137
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.670 
to overcome this barrier.

138
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.900 
Then the second mentioned

139
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.650 
and the value of design and design thinking,

140
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.940 
and this usually happens when you have a lot of different grassroot

141
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.840 
initiative starting with design thinking and every initiative is

142
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.520 
providing their own sense to design thinking.

143
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:59.840 
What happens then usually is that there is no common and unique or coherent perspective

144
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:06.230 
on design thinking available anymore in organizations and this leads to misconceptions.

145
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.430 
My tip to you is try to avoid such misconception situations

146
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.550 
from the beginning, by trying to harmonise the understanding,

147
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.370 
by bringing together these different grassroot initiatives,

148
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.440 
which are initially and mutually good to have.

149
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.980 
And let's try to conceptualize together with all of them what

150
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.850 
the meaning for your organization is and then I think you can

151
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:39.110 
avoid such misconceptions very early on in the introduction process.

152
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.350 
Thirdly, it was mentioned that sometimes short term business objectives

153
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.830 
are hindering the implementation of design thinking on the strategic level,

154
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:55.450 
that's true but on the other hand you can avoid such situations by

155
00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.450 
managing the expectations from the beginning on that design thinking is nothing

156
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:06.100 
you can you can work with or you can have successes

157
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.830 
in weeks or days, design thinking is something where you

158
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:17.500 
need to have a certain amount of endurance. Only if you bring up this endurance,

159
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.560 
the positive effects of design thinking will unfold and as

160
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.000 
you have seen on the study results they do unfold, but you have

161
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.500 
to give them time and therefore managing the expectations right will help you

162
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.190 
to not run in conflict with short-term business objectives.

163
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.570 
And this goes in hand with point number 4, that was

164
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.630 
mentioned faults and too high expectations. Especially in the

165
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.120 
beginning of introducing design thinking this was in 2010,

166
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.880 
2011, when organizations started

167
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.800 
to pick up more and more design thinking, the expectations were

168
00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.320 
usually set way too high in terms of speed of introduction in organizations.

169
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.730 
So try to avoid this pitfall by being honest

170
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:10.800 
the positive effects will come to your organization, but from my personal experience

171
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.110 
it sometimes takes year to three years

172
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:20.760 
to adjust and to transform because, introducing design thinking is not just

173
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:26.780 
setting up a tool box or changing the process charge in your organization,

174
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.330 
but you have to take the people with you, including yourself

175
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:38.420 
and changing us as human beings takes time. And my experience

176
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.350 
tells me, it's 2 to 3 years and on a long run, so a full

177
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.660 
transformation takes even much longer.

178
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.780 
5th, try to avoid any superficial and partial engagements.

179
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:57.140 
That means just setting up workshops for the sake of having

180
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.740 
something that looks fancy and creative,

181
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.950 
it is not helpful, it's even

182
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:10.950 
destroying motivation over time, it's even preventing the introduction of design thinking.

183
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:17.280 
Because if it's superficial, it's not beneficial anymore, it's not providing additional

184
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.640 
outcomes for your own organization, and therefore design

185
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.690 
thinking and is then being put into the corner of financing,

186
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.540 
crazy workshops, and this is what needs to be avoided.

187
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.340 
These superficial and partial engagements. Lastly, what is also

188
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.110 
an inhibitor is this lack of internal capability building,

189
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.640 
so if you only rely on externals, if you only rely on people,

190
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.670 
who are not working or have originally in your organization,

191
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.750 
then you fall short on the mid and long term,

192
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:58.100 
and this is what you always need to keep in mind the best strategy only works out

193
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.770 
if you are trying to embed this kind of knowledge

194
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.880 
inside your own organization.

195
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.850 
So this leads me lastly to what makes it successful

196
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:15.710 
and embed design thinking on a strategic level, and for sure number one topic is

197
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:21.960 
ensuring the top management support, and for sure sometimes management is skeptical,

198
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.130 
and why not and this is their right to be skeptical.

199
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.100 
But what they should still provide is support, they should be

200
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.600 
curious enough to see what is happening if they give you a

201
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.840 
chance to move on, so therefore try to convince the top management

202
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.200 
to give you a chance for introduction. later on in the process

203
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:51.380 
the support needs to grow, and from just providing a chance to introduce,

204
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.100 
you need to move on into a full support

205
00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.580 
by providing budgets, by providing time, and also the ability to transform.

206
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:08.670 
But in the beginning, I think it's enough to to ask for a chance and

207
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:15.460 
to prove design thinking as a good methodology within a certain amount of time.

208
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.200 
And this comes together with setting the expectations right and realistically,

209
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.700 
so do not promise too much,

210
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.360 
because you might not be able to deliver. We are talking about innovation

211
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.630 
and no matter if you use design thinking or not, innovation

212
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.930 
has to deal with risk,

213
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:43.200 
and even with the best methods it might happen that you don't have

214
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.560 
very innovative outcomes in a year.

215
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.360 
It's just statistics right, it might happen that you cannot produce

216
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.200 
in an year already something that's mind blowing or the next unicorn.

217
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.770 
But what we know from our studies and what we know from science is,

218
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.900 
if you introduce design thinking on the mid or long term, you

219
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.790 
will be more successful, that is for sure and therefore keep

220
00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.140 
in mind to set the expectations realistically don't over-promise.

221
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.720 
Better you over deliver after you have set the expectations right.

222
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.300 
And then lastly, what is also a success factor is to always

223
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.610 
keep in mind the long term internal capability building,

224
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.520 
so you need to ramp up and keep up the knowledge,

225
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:41.180 
have your own workforce as soon as possible by

226
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:47.560 
introducing trainings, by introducing partially external coaches in the beginning,

227
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.380 
to enable a knowledge transfer as soon as possible.

228
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.480 
So keep these three bullet points in mind when you are setting

229
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.570 
up a strategy for design thinking. So this is the end of today's co,urse

230
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.820 
and as I said in the beginning, we touch the upper part of the

231
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.910 
design thinking implementation where

232
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.350 
more is coming soon as part of the next courses.

233
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.400 
So far thank you very much for listening to me and see

234
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:19.710 
you soon again.

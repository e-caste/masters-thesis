00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.820 
Okay!! So, Rea,
great to have you.

2
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.490 
Welcome everyone to our coffee
talk session for our openHPI

3
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.220 
course Digital
Entrepreneurship.

4
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.360 
With this course, we aim to
understand digital entrepreneurship

5
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.220 
by taking a scientific perspective
and presenting the current

6
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.750 
debates and research foci
in different core topics.

7
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.420 
These core topics include, for
example, impact entrepreneurship,

8
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.950 
tools and processes, ecosystem,
collaboration, and female entrepreneurship.

9
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.900 
We are very excited that you take
part in this course and that

10
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.300 
you take the time today to talk about your
daily dose of digital entrepreneurship.

11
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.270 
So, I hope everyone has their coffee
ready and let's get started!

12
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.520 
So, our guest for today is Rea
Eldem and I'm very pleased that

13
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.480 
you take the time today to talk
with me and to all the students

14
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.810 
in this digital
entrepreneurship MOOC

15
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.970 
and I would like to start by
asking you to please introduce

16
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750 
yourself to all our viewers. Who are
you and what is your background?

17
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.530 
What do you do? Thank you, Katharina.
Hello! My name is Rea and I'm

18
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.030 
the founder of Invisible Berlin.
With Invisible Berlin, we consult

19
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.000 
organizations on the
topic of gender equity

20
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.620 
and also on the diversity of dimensions
of other kinds. My background

21
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.410 
is actually in gender studies, I
studied cultural studies before

22
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.140 
in my bachelor degree
and then I did a

23
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.850 
master's degree in multi-disciplinary
gender studies at the

24
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.510 
University of Cambridge and I
realized within that year that

25
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.560 
actually a lot of the knowledge
that we have within the gender

26
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
studies world is very much locked
inside academia and doesn't

27
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.400 
really find a way
into practice.

28
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.680 
So, based on this observation, I founded
Invisible Berlin and now, since

29
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.570 
then aim to change that in order
to make the workplace more equal

30
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.670 
and to foster the conversations that
are being held around this topic.

31
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.170 
On a daily basis, this has very
different dimensions so I work

32
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.680 
with organizations and do interviews
with employees to find out

33
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.040 
what their needs are,

34
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.960 
I conduct workshops and
training on this topic,

35
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.560 
I also am a lecturer, for instance, at
the HPI School of Design Thinking.

36
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.050 
And I really tried to
also bring innovation

37
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.270 
into this topic because I feel
like often the conversation

38
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.300 
that we're having around equity
is very much detached from

39
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.520 
other conversations that are
being held within organizations

40
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.150 
and I'm trying to bring it together
because I feel like it's

41
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.830 
actually a topic also that has to do
with strategy a lot and not just with

42
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.330 
I don't know, we need to do something
about it let's just find a quick fix.

43
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.820 
That is quite fascinating
because I think

44
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.880 
that would be my assumption that
with this notion of it is

45
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.330 
about innovation, it is about the
strategy that might also give

46
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330 
you kind of a different path into
the organizations, so, if you

47
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.550 
think about digital
entrepreneurship or maybe digital

48
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.860 
transformation of companies is that
also something where you could

49
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.930 
relate your topics to?

50
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.840 
Yes, definitely. So, what I see
a lot in my work is that a lot

51
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.820 
of times digital entrepreneurship
to people is a means to an

52
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.930 
end, I feel like, instead of a form
and to me it's really rather

53
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.150 
a form, so, I feel like the
question should really rather be

54
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.100 
what is a problem and how do we
want to fix it? And then for

55
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.280 
me digital solutions in any kind
can be a solution to a problem,

56
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.350 
right, so also within this topic, let's
say, a cultural transformation; so,

57
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.520 
let's say, sexism is a problem in
a company then of course digital

58
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.820 
solutions as a framework could be a
really good solutions maybe to fix it

59
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.510 
along with other measures obviously, so,
I think that a lot of times though

60
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.380 
the question is really rather or
the conversation is held wrongly

61
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.110 
and instead of focusing on what
we are trying to fix and how

62
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.770 
digital solutions could be of use,
instead, the question is very

63
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.790 
much focuses very much on the
solutions instead of the problems.

64
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.980 
So, this is also where I find design thinking
as a method very inspiring because it really

65
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.030 
asks us to step back and
to ask, "Ok, wait!

66
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.810 
what are the problems for who and
how we're trying to fix it?"

67
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.410 
And for me and my work for instance
also now with the COVID-19 pandemic

68
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.390 
digital solutions have been very
essential as a framework to

69
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.100 
offer my solutions and
products in digital formats

70
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.190 
but I think a lot of times also
people just also students and

71
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.860 
also organizations colleagues
other entrepreneurs just try

72
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.120 
to come up with
something digital

73
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.670 
in order to, I don't know why
actually may be in order to stick

74
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.280 
with a trend, I don't know but
I feel like the focus is less

75
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.490 
on the problem often.

76
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.470 
Right, right! Would you actually
have an example of how you use

77
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.010 
digital as a mean so you kind of
pointed towards when you just

78
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.410 
talked about it, so, would you have
an example from your practice of

79
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.990 
how you use that? Yes, so for
instance, when we do the interviews

80
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.830 
now we do them digitally, I
mean otherwise it doesn't

81
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.230 
really work so we have anonymous
interviews with employees

82
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.760 
to find out what their needs are
and how they feel and they can,

83
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.750 
I mean, I think, the whole
infrastructure, for instance, is

84
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.410 
entirely digital,
so, they use

85
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.450 
different providers and to book in
their slots so it's anonymous

86
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.050 
that's important, so, the organizations
that they work for don't

87
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.570 
really see whom we talk to then we do
the interviews entirely digitally

88
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.710 
then we do workshops based on these
interviews, we use platforms like Miro,

89
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.560 
Mural in order to facilitate
these workshops

90
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.870 
then I mean there are also other
places that I find very inspiring

91
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.950 
who take this even to a next level and
to actually build infrastructure

92
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.610 
themselves which is something we
don't do but who then, for

93
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.220 
instance, provide applications for
employees in order to whistle blow or to

94
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:51.240 
find or to build a structure within organizations
to tackle diversity problems, for example.

95
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.140 
Right! I see, but at the core is
as you mentioned before you

96
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.430 
need to start first what is it
what the people needs or what

97
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.570 
is it what the organization need
and then you build structure

98
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.470 
and infrastructure and tools,
right? I think so, yeah! Ok, wow!

99
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.450 
Well that hopefully will make, you
know, this whole path a little

100
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.610 
easier I would assume but,
yeah, so coming to

101
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.150 
the topic of female entrepreneurship I
mean you are a female entrepreneur,

102
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.370 
you already said that you
had in your studies some

103
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.340 
some first insights into
that topic so for you,

104
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.250 
what is female entrepreneurship
and do we actually need

105
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.480 
female entrepreneurship
or doesn't

106
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.500 
entrepreneurship
cover it all?

107
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.680 
Thanks for the question, I think
it's really important actually

108
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.910 
to talk about this because for
me, female entrepreneurship in

109
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.840 
a nutshell is entrepreneurship
by female identifying people

110
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.130 
so I think it's important
to stress the fact that

111
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.820 
if we talk about female entrepreneurship,
the interesting thing is really

112
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:09.390 
the position that people who
identify as female are having

113
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.530 
within the entrepreneurship
sphere, in the world, in society

114
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.560 
because that's what makes them
"special" if you want, so, that's

115
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.510 
what shapes their perspective, I'm
not a very big fan of attributing

116
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.290 
certain characteristics to women just
because they are born in a different

117
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.430 
body or they carry that with
them as a like biologist

118
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.660 
perspective, what I do think
is important though is that

119
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.680 
of course experiences that people
make are based on the perspectives

120
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.240 
that they have and also the body
and the physical manifestation

121
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.900 
that they have when they walk
through life and I think this

122
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.750 
is what shapes specific perspective
not just by females, by the way, but

123
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.150 
by different people,
so, I think

124
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:58.650 
people who are raised and then read as
females have a very different perspective

125
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.210 
and this is something
that they can really

126
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.650 
thrive from because then they
have different problems that

127
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.750 
they see and this goes back to
the first answer, right, that

128
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.630 
it's all about the problem space
and if people then have different

129
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.010 
problems that they see that
maybe others don't see this is

130
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.590 
I think what could make
female entrepreneurs

131
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.420 
sometimes have very innovative ideas
or approaches to things just because

132
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:29.920 
as it was before their perspective has
often been very marginalised so I think

133
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.990 
this is where digital entrepreneurship
can then come in as a handy solution

134
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.620 
in order to give
these problems

135
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.740 
or their solutions a certain
framework. Right, yeah! I definitely

136
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.680 
I definitely agree and I think, I
mean what if we look at or when

137
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.410 
we look at research what we can
see is that female entrepreneurs

138
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.280 
usually not only have kind of a
better value proposition because

139
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.840 
they look, they ask those questions
as you just mentioned but

140
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.360 
what they also do is most of the
times they are a lot more effective

141
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.450 
in what they do so using
the money they raised

142
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.810 
more wisely, they actually,
it take you know, they

143
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.680 
have longer periods of time, they
have this money and they build

144
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:27.170 
their companies actually more
sustainable if you want so if

145
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.890 
and that is actually quite
interesting if you look at the

146
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.710 
venture capitalist perspective
they should actually invest

147
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.440 
a lot more in female-led startups
because they are in many of those

148
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.690 
traditional but also non-traditional
success criteria more successful

149
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.540 
however, as both of us know
it's really hard not only for

150
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.860 
female-identifying people actually
starting their own venture

151
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.850 
but also raising money, so, what are
your observations in this respect?

152
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.790 
Yeah, I think you're completely
right and I think that's also one

153
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.330 
of the biggest
challenges, right, that

154
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.590 
the problem is currently that
the people who have the money

155
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.870 
and who then have the
responsibility and also the power

156
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.350 
to frame which direction digital
entrepreneurship and also

157
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.110 
innovation and on a general note
in the direction it goes they

158
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.010 
are often not the ones to share
the perspective with female

159
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.480 
entrepreneurs because they are
mostly white male, so, if we look

160
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.020 
at the VCs who sits in VCs, so
that's why I think it's really

161
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.850 
important and that's also very research
fact that actually we need to

162
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.580 
aim at diversifying these, yeah, these
structures as well because people

163
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.330 
let's say someone has a really,
like a female entrepreneur,

164
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.410 
a really good idea but then
pitches in front of an all-male

165
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.880 
VC who don't understand her problem
and the solution, and where

166
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.970 
she's coming from because
they can't empathise

167
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.160 
because it's, for instance, I don't
know, something that has to do with

168
00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.650 
women's health and they don't
really see the problem, so,

169
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.650 
I think there are a lot of really
interesting studies that show

170
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.820 
that so on a product level, on a solution
level, content level, there's often

171
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.250 
a very big gap and I think that's
why, for one reason, it's really

172
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.290 
important to change this, on the
other side, there's also a lot

173
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.760 
of studies
suggesting that

174
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:24.210 
also beyond this content level
just on a gender bias level

175
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.710 
women are also often read differently
like if I say the same thing they're

176
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.040 
perceived differently, right, so
the same person with the same

177
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.730 
CV which has a female name on
it will be perceived as less

178
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.040 
hireable, will be given less money,
will be read as less competent

179
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.680 
and there are so many studies showing
that this is also happening

180
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.710 
within the VC world and when it
comes to entrepreneurship and who

181
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:54.420 
is understood how? Right, so, what
can we do? I mean, how can we

182
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.910 
you, me, everyone, I mean, how can
we change this what can we do?

183
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.690 
Good question! So, I think, first
of all, the biggest challenge

184
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.780 
is I guess, to get the people to
really challenge themselves

185
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.160 
because those other people who,
I mean, the people that we are

186
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.140 
now talking about to have the power of
not the ones who have the problem

187
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.240 
for them it doesn't really
matter however on a long run I

188
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.530 
would agree with you, I mean,
even on a very economic level I

189
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.250 
mean to stay innovative, to be
future-driven, sustainable, you

190
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.070 
need to accommodate and really
rebuild the structure, so, I think,

191
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.980 
it's even in their interest that
they really start to think

192
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.520 
what can we do better to make our biases
visible, you know, to challenge each other

193
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.050 
to really question how we give
money to whom, for instance?

194
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.650 
So, I think on a very basic level
becoming more aware of what

195
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.320 
biases there are and that every
person has biases, I mean, also

196
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.360 
women, me, like you,
it's not just

197
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.780 
yes, it's not, I mean, I think
sometimes people have the wrong

198
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.280 
assumption that women are like
the better people, that's not

199
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.410 
true, I mean, we all race in the same
society with sexes, races, structures

200
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.930 
in order to unlearn them we need
to put a lot of work into

201
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.190 
it and I think making it aware, making
people aware that it's not just

202
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.610 
in our heads but it's also the
structures, the processes, so,

203
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.990 
you can start by, you know, challenging the
way that you go about a recruitment process

204
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.190 
or a VC funding process it's, I
mean, you can really apply the

205
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.380 
set of questions to
different spaces I think.

206
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:37.500 
Yeah, yeah, right! Yeah, yeah and
I think that will also help us

207
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.050 
because if we are now talking
about this context of digital

208
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.080 
we know that also

209
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.590 
computers machines they need to
be raised differently because

210
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:54.240 
we see that on and on. Now, I'd
like to go back one more time

211
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.810 
to the digital sphere, I think we
already touched a little bit on

212
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:04.480 
how digital means and tools can
actually help female entrepreneurship

213
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.490 
so we thought we talked
about instruments

214
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:16.120 
but can you think about any other
possible ways to the future how

215
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:22.010 
the combination of digital entrepreneurship
and female entrepreneurship, how

216
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.170 
this could actually, well if we
think big, help us to solve the

217
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.980 
ground challenges, I mean, are
there, can you think of any

218
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:39.780 
any possible overlaps or how one
side could benefit from the other?

219
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.530 
What I thought was interesting
actually because I'm also in a

220
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.110 
quite a lot of network with female
entrepreneurs and some of them

221
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.520 
have told me that they perceived
the COVID-19 pandemic as

222
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.700 
quite beneficial because they were, for
instance, pitching in from their laptops

223
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.310 
to VCs and not being physically there,
so, one of them was pregnant,

224
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:03.540 
for instance and said it was interesting
because she and her co-founder who both

225
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.610 
actually were pregnant last year
never had to mention this to anyone

226
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.140 
so I thought that was
actually, it really started

227
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.230 
my thinking process on, ah,
interesting! what does it do if we

228
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.110 
see people less because we know
that a lot of these biases

229
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.010 
are within our appearance and
manifesting into our bodies so

230
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.720 
I think this is something that
is interesting to think about,

231
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.910 
although, I guess on a utopic
level, one shouldn't try to

232
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.760 
I mean, yes, that could be a
solution but we don't want

233
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.240 
to hide people just because they are being
discriminated against obviously but

234
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.470 
I guess making
use of these

235
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.810 
maybe just aha moments that were
happening over the last year within

236
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.920 
this situation because I think,
it did force a lot of people

237
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.740 
to become more digital, and collaboration
to be more digital where it wasn't

238
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.840 
before, I think, maybe there are some
learnings that we can derive from that

239
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.360 
and also I think with this whole
topic of just becoming more

240
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.210 
flexible and being able to organize
your work differently, I

241
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.500 
think, there are some opportunities to
that also for female entrepreneurship

242
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.380 
however, also some threats when I
see how many people are working

243
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.940 
and especially women now
within the pandemic and

244
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.270 
you know, I mean, you
know the whole shift

245
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.550 
that we have right now back to
traditional roles away from

246
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.690 
the process that we have made which is
really frustrating. Right, yeah! I agree

247
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.920 
yeah, I think it's, yeah, there are
pros and definitely some cons

248
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.760 
but hopefully, it helps us as
you sat by reflecting on what

249
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.130 
is currently happening, and what
is good, and what is bad, what

250
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.940 
do we want to keep and what do we
definitely do not want to keep?

251
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:49.320 
Alright! Rea, thank you so much
and as the last question to you

252
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.300 
now, I'm a fairy and there's one
wish I grant you, what would

253
00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:00.190 
be your wish for female/digital
entrepreneurship?

254
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.380 
Well, I think my main wish would be
that we shift the conversation

255
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.040 
because I feel like so much of
the conversation is being held

256
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.440 
on what women and in that case female
entrepreneurs should do, shouldn't do,

257
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.610 
need to do, there's so much
literature and it really makes me

258
00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.650 
very angry, so, I would like to shift
this whole conversation around

259
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.490 
and focus it more on what does everyone
need to do, which structures

260
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.090 
do we need to change in order to
accommodate a climate where

261
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.080 
everyone can be an
entrepreneur?

262
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.830 
Excellent! What a last
sentence! Thank you!

263
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.950 
Thank you so much,
Katharina.

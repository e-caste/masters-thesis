00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.650 
In this video we will have a look about the potential to save CO2

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.190 
by using ICT, which is the technology in digitalisation. So information and communication

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.060 
technologies.

4
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.140 
Digitalisation often transforms physical goods in virtual goods.

5
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.210 
And the question is, if it's actually always saving CO2.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.260 
As you've seen in the previous examples already, you have to

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.140 
have a look at two sides of the coin. But in general there's

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.900 
a lot of potential to save CO2 using ICT.

9
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.190 
One example is the transport of information. While earlier we were sending

10
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.090 
letters in an analogue way with quite some effort for transport, now you send

11
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.510 
it in a digital way. For instance with emails. This has other

12
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.550 
effects too, but if you look at only the CO2 consumption it

13
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.450 
saves CO2 for every information that you send compared to the

14
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.050 
letters we sent earlier.

15
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.140 
Also again, the example from paper books to e-books. If you read more than

16
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.280 
thirty to sixty books on an e-book, then it's ecologically more

17
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.860 
beneficial than the paper books.

18
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.530 
There's many other example. Let's take one more. In the electricity network market

19
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.080 
there is a concept called smart grids and smart energy markets with intelligent software

20
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.990 
and combined with good hardware, there's much potential there

21
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.610 
to save CO2 using ICT.

22
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.960 
And talking about examples we will have now look in many other examples

23
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.690 
where we can save CO2 with digital tools.

24
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.210 
We will follow a study that has been published by the bitkom,

25
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.290 
that states that digitization can save one in five tonnes of

26
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.680 
CO2. So twenty percent of potential.

27
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.510 
The study claims that digital technologies can contribute half

28
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.360 
of the emissions reductions that are necessary for Germany

29
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.500 
until 2030. So this is a large potential

30
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.370 
using ICT and also enable us to save

31
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.300 
enormous amounts of CO2. So in general they see a lot of potential

32
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.330 
in saving CO2, but they say the crucial factor is the pace

33
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.050 
at which we will progress on this journey. So,

34
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.160 
depending on how fast the policy will

35
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.340 
create the corresponding regulations and also how we everyone

36
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.190 
of us who is working in IT

37
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.210 
is using the tools in every day, the pace will be the decisive factor if we

38
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.770 
actually will save this potential or not.

39
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.360 
Now let's have a look at some examples.

40
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.900 
Following the study of bitkom, they see

41
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.880 
examples in many different areas. They are clustered in production, mobility,

42
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.090 
energy, buildings, work and business, agriculture, and health. And

43
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.660 
in each of these sectors, you have potentials using software sometimes also hardware

44
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.680 
and we will have a look in some of them now.

45
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.330 
Let's start with the sector that has the highest potential

46
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.140 
according to the study. And when I say highest potential

47
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.820 
you should always have a critical mind looking at numbers also

48
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.190 
here because in the background, in the calculation there is

49
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.370 
a lot of assumptions. So as with any study, I advise you to have

50
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.510 
a critical mind but in this study, the buildings

51
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.950 
the building sector is claimed as having the highest potential

52
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.920 
to save CO2 by intelligent building management systems

53
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.830 
on software that are combined with energy efficient components, such as

54
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.290 
efficient lights, good air conditioning, heating with renewable energies

55
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.210 
and also energetic renovation. If you

56
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.640 
do all of this and take care about all these components, that

57
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.470 
are as you see not only software but also hardware, then there's a potential

58
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.300 
of almost thirty percent in the building sector.

59
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.490 
Another example in the smart grid -

60
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.210 
the potential here is between twenty and thirty percent. When

61
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.150 
you use intelligent control of the energy network using software and again

62
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.880 
by installing modern hardware. So, again the combination of software

63
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.590 
and hardware is the crucial

64
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.070 
factor to gain these potential. If you're doing this, it's almost

65
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.870 
as much as in the building sector.

66
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.810 
In the mobility sector, there's quite some potential to. Roughly about fifteen percent

67
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.420 
and this is actually quite straightforward, because basically it's mostly

68
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.730 
about home-office and doing remote work which reduces

69
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.020 
just the fossil fuel that you use to consume when commuting

70
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.250 
to work every day or on business trips.

71
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.130 
Another example that is given in this mobility sector is that

72
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.820 
ridepooling, on demand ridepooling has a high potential too.

73
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.330 
So ridepooling is claimed as reducing fifty percent of kilometers in comparison

74
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.850 
to individual mobility by everyone driving on his own.

75
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.890 
So there's a lot of potential here too

76
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.090 
in the mode how you do mobility but also in

77
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.510 
just staying where you normally live and working remotely and

78
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.460 
reducing business trips by using video, for instance video conference

79
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.940 
systems.

80
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.130 
A last example is giving in the health sector.

81
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.190 
There you save six to eight percent if you just

82
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.590 
digitalize the patient records. So there's even in the health sector

83
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.480 
and only with this measurement, quite a bit of potential using

84
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.040 
digital tools to save CO2.

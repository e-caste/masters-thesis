1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.280 
What is impact entrepreneurship,
what are related concepts, and

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.060 
What could you learn from impact
entrepreneurs for yourself?

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.620 
In this session on Impact
entrepreneurship, we want to speak

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.980 
about those forms of entrepreneurship that
are concerned with sustainable development

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.040 
including social entrepreneurship, ecological
or environmental entrepreneurship.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.260 
We will also discuss the challenges and
outcomes of impact entrepreneurship

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.360 
and take a look at
policy implications.

8
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.480 
Welcome! My name is Katharina HÃ¶lzle
and my name is Nina Bachmann.

9
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.540 
In today's session, we want to give
you insight into the role of

10
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.240 
sustainability topics in
entrepreneurship research. In this

11
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.010 
video, we will define the research
landscape of impact entrepreneurship

12
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.970 
and discuss motivation and
opportunities. In the next video,

13
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.070 
we will discuss the challenges of impact
entrepreneurship, particularly with regard

14
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.500 
to the specific characteristics of
this domain. In the final video,

15
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.650 
you will learn about the outcomes
of impact entrepreneurship, and

16
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.530 
we will also take a look at the role of policy
and the role of digital technologies.

17
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.300 
So, let's jump into the first topic -
what does impact entrepreneurship

18
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.250 
actually mean?

19
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.890 
First of all: The study of how entrepreneurs
engage with impact and sustainable development

20
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.040 
is a young academic field. Nevertheless, let's
try to define impact entrepreneurship.

21
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.710 
Not surprisingly for a new research field, there
are various definitions and terminologies.

22
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.370 
In a recent definition of Markman
and colleagues, they refer to

23
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.170 
"the development of sustained
applications and solutions

24
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.390 
that collectively address grand
challenges to make the world better.

25
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.730 
Impact entrepreneurs apply economics logic, but
they prioritize solving formidable challenges

26
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.430 
ahead of wealth
creation."

27
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.080 
But don't worry, you don't have
to remember that by heart. What

28
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.730 
many concepts and definitions
have in common is the discovery

29
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.370 
and creation of entrepreneurial
opportunities that pursue economic gain

30
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.180 
and simultaneously sustain the
natural and the social environment.

31
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.720 
As you may have already guessed, related
concepts have variously been described as

32
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.570 
sustainable entrepreneurship, social
entrepreneurship, environmental entrepreneurship,

33
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.380 
ecopreneurship (eco-entrepreneurship),
and green entrepreneurship.

34
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.110 
But what makes the definition of impact
entrepreneurship that challenging?

35
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.680 
Well, this is because it can
cover so much from charities to

36
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.790 
foundations to non-profit companies
all the way to for-profit companies

37
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.640 
Moreover, within the domain of
entrepreneurship research,

38
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.360 
disagreements already persist about the
term entrepreneurship - and, of course,

39
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.450 
added the prefix "sustainable" or
the prefix "impact" further fires

40
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.110 
the debate on definitions.
As mentioned before,

41
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.060 
research on social or environmental
entrepreneurship is actually a

42
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.360 
rather young
research domain.

43
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.180 
One question that researchers
have been asking is

44
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.310 
How can societal change towards
sustainable development be created

45
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.980 
and by whom? To start with:
In 2009, the Global

46
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.280 
Entrepreneurship Monitor introduced
the first cross-national

47
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.250 
study of social
entrepreneurship.

48
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.720 
In this study, they surveyed 48 countries
about social entrepreneurship activities.

49
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.290 
The study provided the first comparative
analysis of the occurrence and the types

50
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.650 
of social entrepreneurship
activities around the world.

51
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.810 
In the most recent Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor from 2020,

52
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.860 
the authors now argue that entrepreneurship
is a uniquely powerful mechanism

53
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.760 
for economic and social development,
generating incomes and

54
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.590 
jobs while enabling and enriching
individuals and communities. Truly,

55
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.020 
an engine for change. Further, the authors
observed the motivations of entrepreneurs

56
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.230 
They especially highlighted the
emergence of purpose-driven

57
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.160 
entrepreneurship as a
kind of new motivation.

58
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.180 
Therefore, the purpose adds as a
motivation to the typical motivations,

59
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.990 
such as living from entrepreneurship
or generating wealth.

60
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.320 
Also, academic interest is increasing.
In particular, we as researchers

61
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.410 
are interested in understanding impact
entrepreneurship, its origins, and its implications.

62
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.060 
So, let's dive into empirical
research and see what researchers

63
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.240 
already found out about this
type of entrepreneurship.

64
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.910 
Several empirical studies have investigated
what motivates impact entrepreneurs.

65
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.710 
Let us present
some of them

66
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.790 
In an empirical study
from 2020, Kruse and

67
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.020 
colleagues took a closer look
at social entrepreneurs.

68
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.540 
They found out that several
individual factors, such as an open

69
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.840 
and proactive personality, as well
as the perceived feasibility

70
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.450 
and desirability of a social mission,
motivates the social entrepreneurs

71
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.620 
to seek to develop
social ventures.

72
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.340 
The authors also found evidence
that the social legitimacy

73
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.540 
attributed to social entrepreneurial
behavior is positively

74
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.730 
related to entrepreneurial
intention.

75
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.010 
Moreover, in the same study, they
found that a combination of

76
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.050 
previous social and entrepreneurial
experience has a higher positive

77
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.550 
relation to social entrepreneurial intention
than only social experiences alone.

78
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.070 
That means - those individuals that
combine both forms of experience

79
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.570 
will be particularly motivated
to start a social enterprise.

80
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.910 
Let us look at another really
interesting empirical finding for you.

81
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.220 
Individuals that live in countries with higher
levels of economic and social development

82
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.550 
are more likely to seek to
develop social ventures.

83
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.640 
Intuitively, one could argue that higher levels
of market failures and social inequalities

84
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.430 
may lead to greater engagement in social
entrepreneurship. But, from the data,

85
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.730 
it is evident that countries
from more socially supportive

86
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.290 
culture host more social entrepreneur.
Note, that this finding

87
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.570 
remain stable if they account
for an individual effect

88
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.790 
such as higher educational levels.
Consequently, the authors of

89
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.530 
of this study conclude that
increasing the level of social and

90
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.940 
economic development will foster higher
levels of social entrepreneurship.

91
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.310 
Alongside the question of what
motivates entrepreneurs, researchers

92
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.390 
have also asked the question which opportunities
actually lead to impact entrepreneurship.

93
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.470 
Historically, humans have often
been frustrated by grand societal

94
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.160 
challenges, such as social inequalities
or environmental concerns.

95
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.850 
People often hold governments responsible
to act and overcome these problems

96
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.730 
but as we know governments are sometimes
more and sometimes rather less successful.

97
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.440 
Impact entrepreneurs, however, draw
their inspiration from these

98
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.720 
failures and aim to address these
environmental and social challenges -

99
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.930 
thereby complementing the
government's involvement.

100
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.490 
In other words, they persist or
they perceive opportunities

101
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.520 
where others see problems. So, to
say - a problem for the commercial

102
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.750 
entrepreneur is an opportunity
for the social entrepreneur.

103
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.960 
Consequently, impact entrepreneurs aim
to positively impact the social,

104
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.520 
ecological and the
political realities.

105
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.490 
Let's take a look at two different
kinds of market shortcomings

106
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.070 
that promote the emergence
of entrepreneurs.

107
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.450 
First: social market failure. This is
the case when commercial market forces

108
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.790 
do not meet with a social need, for
example, when those that need

109
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.590 
a service, such as health care are not able
to pay for this health care service.

110
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.650 
The second kind of market shortcomings
are ecological market imperfections.

111
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.650 
These frequently result in
environmental degradation.

112
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.960 
Let's look at some examples of those
ecological market imperfections. First -

113
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.370 
inefficient firms, for example,
when ineffectual inefficient

114
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.140 
production or recycling processes
which result in significant

115
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.840 
waste of natural
resources.

116
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.410 
Another example would be flawed
pricing mechanisms. This refers

117
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.410 
to the fact that natural resources
such as clean air and water

118
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.510 
are undervalued and under-priced.
The market does not accurately

119
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:16.110 
reflect supply and demand and
consequently those natural resources

120
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.410 
are not used in a
sustainable way.

121
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.140 
Looking at these shortcomings,
experts suggest that the key

122
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:28.350 
to achieving a sustainable future lies
in overcoming this malfunctioning

123
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.700 
of social or
environmental markets.

124
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.540 
And researchers have identified
entrepreneurship as a suitable

125
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.010 
means to address this!

126
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.010 
Entrepreneurs take action while
other people fail to act. While

127
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.070 
entrepreneurs are generally good at identifying
market opportunities, some of them,

128
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.040 
specifically the impact entrepreneurs
explicitly seek to address

129
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.470 
these market failures and solve
societal problems. Thereby, the

130
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:02.340 
UN's Sustainable Development Goals are the
inspiration for many types of entrepreneurship

131
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.920 
that combines value creation with
conservation of the natural

132
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.160 
environment and social protection.
To sum it up in one sentence -

133
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.270 
pressing sustainability issues
create various types of market

134
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:21.090 
failures which present opportunities
for impact entrepreneurs.

135
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.530 
So much for the first video in
today's session on the relevance

136
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.260 
and motivation of impact entrepreneurs,
as well as the special role

137
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.580 
of opportunities for this
kind of entrepreneurship.

138
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.080 
See you in the next one where
we will pick up from here and

139
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.980 
discuss challenges that are specific
to impact entrepreneurship

140
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.610 
and how to
overcome them.

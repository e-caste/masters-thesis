00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.090 
This course is the second part of
a three course series on design

2
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.520 
thinking. You can still participate
if you haven't taken the

3
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.850 
first course but are interested
in the particular skills for

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.040 
synthesis and idea generation.
Nonetheless, we recommend to take

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.780 
a look at the first MOOC on
design research which is still

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.060 
accessible in archive
mode. In this video

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.750 
we will give you a short
summary of that first course.

8
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.880 
In the 'Inspirations for Design'
course we walked through the phase

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.820 
of finding inspiration. We focused
on two essential skills in

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.300 
design research: Observation
and Qualitative Interviews.

11
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.040 
We asked learners to pay attention to
workarounds in their environment.

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.730 
Workarounds are fast fixes that
people create themselves to

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
fulfill an unmet need. Participants learned
to phrase a "Job to be done"

14
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.450 
formulation which helped them
to figure out the user's

15
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.420 
motivation. In the next step, we
explored the skill of qualitative

16
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.130 
interviewing together. Having an
open and honest conversation

17
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
with an interviewee can be very
inspiring for your topic.

18
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.540 
It helps us to learn about
other people's experiences.

19
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.310 
The course provided examples for
interviewing techniques and

20
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.810 
asked participants to conduct
their own interviews.

21
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.590 
In this course we will work with
such data from design research.

22
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.400 
You will identify user needs,
formulate brainstorming questions,

23
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.360 
facilitate a brainstorming session
and come up with creative

24
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.940 
ideas to solve user
problems. Have fun!

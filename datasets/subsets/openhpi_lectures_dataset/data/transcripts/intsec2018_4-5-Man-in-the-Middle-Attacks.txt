1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.380 
now we consider the so called
man in the middle attack.

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.450 
the idea of such a man in the
middle attack is that an

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.400 
attacker tries to get a position
between the two communication

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.120 
partners. but he tries to get this
position in such a way that

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.880 
he can see all the communication
from the both partners,

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.130 
but the communication
partners are not aware.

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.420 
there is one someone that
occur in the middle.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.430 
so mostly in such men is
a middle attack, the

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.640 
MITM is unnoticed, we
speak of transparence,

10
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.790 
for the users by the affected
communication participants.

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.480 
and that makes such kind of a
context difficult and dangerous.

12
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.890 
there are various types,
various different types

13
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.340 
of such man in the middle attacks,
which you run at different

14
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
level of various communication
protocols and services.

15
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.380 
for example, we know men in the
middle attacks on the domain

16
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.370 
name system, in communication level,
we know a man in the middle attacks

17
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.440 
SSL/TLS secure socket
layer, on http hypertext

18
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.800 
transfer protocol level and also
the display of web pages,

19
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
(in the web browsers). so let's have
a closer look at such kinds of

20
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.630 
man in the middle attacks. he
are two communication partners

21
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.140 
A and B. they communicate with
each other. for example, B

22
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.700 
is sending something to the
communication partner A.

23
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.990 
but in reality ,without
the awareness of b,

24
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.860 
the message is sent over to the
attacker and the attacker can

25
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.120 
read the message and
manipulates the message,

26
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.690 
and then he can forward the
message to the communication

27
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.290 
parmar a, with a spoof of sender
address. so the two partners

28
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.830 
are not aware that there is a
man or a woman, an attacker

29
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.940 
in the middle. let's look
at such kind of attacks

30
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.490 
on the various protocol levels.
let's start with the so called

31
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.670 
DNS-domain name server man
in the middle attacker.

32
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.330 
to remind you DNS, the
domain name system

33
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.750 
this is a assignment to see the
names, see the domain names,

34
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.120 
We see the IP addresses. so if for
humans it's easier to work with

35
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.320 
domain names instead of the
complicated internet addresses.

36
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.120 
so the domain in system
associate the name and the

37
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.340 
ip address for the communication.
now the idea of the DNS

38
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.380 
men in the middle attack
is that the attacker

39
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.970 
manipulates this DNS table. he
manipulates the association

40
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.030 
of a domain name to an ip address.
so he connects, he tries to

41
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.110 
connect the domain name of a
user of the communication

42
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.540 
by its own association
between the domain name

43
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.930 
and ip address of the user by
replacing the users ip address

44
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.370 
by its own IP address. so in
force that everyone who sends

45
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.380 
an information, a mail
or an message to

46
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.960 
the user with the domain
name of the user,

47
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.120 
then because of the wrong association,
the mail or the message is

48
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.390 
forward to the attacker. so
with dns men in the middle

49
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.850 
attack, an attacker en sure was
that victims domain name is

50
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.410 
assigned to his or her
own ip address and

51
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.340 
in consequence, all the
messages to those domain name

52
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.530 
are delivered to the attacker.
so a concrete text scenario

53
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.220 
you're looking, as follows: an
attacker performs in DNS spoofing

54
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.410 
with the victims' domain
name. so all data

55
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.120 
packets which are sent
to the victim domain

56
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.350 
then delivered to the
attackers ip address.

57
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.180 
the attacker reads the message
or manipulates the data and

58
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.760 
then forwards the data to the
victims real ip address,

59
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.110 
take a note is,that the
it there in real the

60
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.410 
victim is typically,
not becomes aware

61
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.740 
that the message did not
directly come from

62
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.420 
the other partner. Another men
in the middle attack is on

63
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.230 
the browser level. the man
is a browser attacker.

64
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.830 
it's about man puts
malicious program

65
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.750 
in the browser, manipulating
the view of web pages

66
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.770 
and capturing input data. so it
is a particular form of a man

67
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.440 
in the middle attack at
the application level.

68
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.210 
domain names the stage of web. browsers
are on the application level.

69
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.650 
and a very widespread functionality
in many trojans, especially

70
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.400 
in banking trojans comes
with such an idea.

71
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.710 
so the famous Zeus, or
SpyEye or Caberp.

72
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.010 
those are trojans with
exactly that functionality

73
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.120 
that they show something
different than what's expected.

74
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.340 
man is a middle attacker,
is also possible on the

75
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.720 
SSL/TLS levels.
this is the

76
00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:02.030 
security level for the
communication in the internet.

77
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.010 
so it is above the
transport-layer and

78
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.060 
provides a possibility to encrypt
on all what's going on.

79
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.110 
so it is on the security level.
so a particular problem

80
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.160 
that affects to the security
layer which is responsible

81
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.240 
for the end to end encryption and
also for secure authentication.

82
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.150 
This is the SSL/TLS
attack. The users

83
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.760 
having a previously established
men in the middle position

84
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.520 
on the lower protocol level, for
example by means of such an

85
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.870 
DNS MITM attack, and
this is what the

86
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.310 
attacker misuse. SSL/TLS
enables communication

87
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.970 
partners to remind you to identify
himself through digital

88
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.160 
certificates. this digital
certificates which help to identify

89
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.180 
a user makes it difficult
for an attacker

90
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.540 
to perform such a man
in the middle attack.

91
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.880 
but a attackers also find ways
to deal with this difficult.

92
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.660 
the men in the middle attack
on this ssl/tls level,

93
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.370 
works only in case of
configuration arrows

94
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.580 
in the ssl/tls connection and it
works only if humans are careless

95
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.020 
when accepting for example
the fake certificates.

96
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.460 
let's have a closer look
on this very dangerous

97
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.020 
SSL/TLS man in the middle
attack. an attacker creates a

98
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.510 
fake digital certificate
which names bank.com.

99
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.290 
the difference to the real
bank.com certificate is that

100
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.880 
this fake certificate
has not

101
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.910 
signed due to the
duplication. because the

102
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.410 
name of bank.com
is already

103
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.720 
certified by a trustworthy body.
so there is no possibility

104
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.690 
for the attacker to get
the same name certified.

105
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:25.450 
so now it is on the side of the
victim. when the victim accepts

106
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.550 
such a fake certificate, even in
case of a warning about the

107
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.120 
non trustworthy certificate it
appears, then the attacker

108
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.870 
can perform such a men
in the middle attack

109
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.160 
on the ssl/tsl level. The
typical warning you can

110
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.770 
see, if the website does
not know the certificate,

111
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.190 
if it's not signed by
a trustworthy body,

112
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.350 
i'm quite sure you have
already seen it on

113
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.150 
your computer ,and if you click it
back and say you can continue,

114
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.090 
then the system works with
the fake certificate

115
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:11.550 
and it is hacker can continue
to performs the attack.

116
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.770 
if the user accepts such a fake
certificate, he or she then

117
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.740 
unwittingly uses the created
encrypted connection

118
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.120 
to the attacker and not to the
desired communication partner. in

119
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.090 
our case, there is no encrypted
connection to the bank.

120
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.100 
there are in the consequence
of except things wrong, this

121
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.020 
fate certificate is an
encrypted connection

122
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.790 
to the attacker. so then the
attacker puts a connection

123
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.310 
to zero and that
on his side,

124
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.340 
he or she builds a connection
to the real bank.

125
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.440 
in order to pass communications
on and to remain undetected.

126
00:09:52.980 --> 00:10:00.650 
So the user is thinking to
interact and communicate with

127
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.020 
with the real bank, and in the
start of when such a connection

128
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.750 
is established the connection
is secure and the ssl/tsl

129
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.440 
connection is
established and

130
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.520 
the certificate is needed. because
the both sides need to know

131
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.550 
who is the partner. and in the
moment, the user excepts

132
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.640 
certificate of the attacker
instead of the certificate of

133
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.690 
the back. then the
user communicates

134
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.280 
oversee the station of
the attacker with

135
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:46.450 
the bank and now, all what
the users is doing can

136
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.570 
be controlled, can be considered
,can be manipulated

137
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.560 
by the attacker and then
to remain undetected

138
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.500 
that the attacker
communicates with the bank

139
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.440 
and forwards some fake
message. So at the end,

140
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:10.350 
the user has the
feeling that he

141
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.350 
or she communicates
directly with the bank.

142
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.230 
so the attacker is in the middle.
so what are protection measures

143
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.380 
against such man in
the middle attacks?

144
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.550 
the problem is: first, that
it's often difficult

145
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.800 
to discover such an attack. so the
most important counter measures

146
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.160 
to prevent men in the middle attack
is a strong authentication.

147
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.900 
that it's really clear
who is a partner,

148
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.080 
in case of accepting such
a fake certificate.

149
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.980 
if the strong
authentication

150
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.160 
is not performed,

151
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.430 
the man in the middle attack
could be performed.

152
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.700 
By strong authentication,
there are different

153
00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.020 
typical ways. by means of the
user digits certificate,

154
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:07.910 
and in some cases it's necessary
that as a user is very careful

155
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.090 
to consider who is communicating
with. that we discussed already

156
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.630 
this faked websites and
also other things.

157
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.750 
and we already saw it
if the user is not

158
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.600 
aware, if he's not looking
carefully who is a communication

159
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.940 
partner, then a men
in the middle

160
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.730 
attacks are possible.
Nonetheless the ssl/tls

161
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:38.040 
men in the middle it's also
possible with certificates

162
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:45.190 
not verified

163
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.890 
not by trustworthy agencies. have
the certifications verified

164
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:56.610 
by a trustworthy third party.
then as a it is difficult

165
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.990 
and the attacker cannot performs
such a man in the middle attack.

166
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.770 
it's also as a content measure
as a protection necessary

167
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.460 
that one has a close attention
of such certificate warnings.

168
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:17.200 
do not say i except it be
careful or look clearly to the

169
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.860 
certificate before you give
any kind of reactions.

170
00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.950 
then for operators, an
additional protection measures

171
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.780 
against the men in
the middle attacks

172
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.950 
is the use of static
certificates.

173
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.230 
This is gene certificate which
is stored as the first

174
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.150 
communication. for example,
the registration

175
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.160 
at a bank. This is the certificate
for all kind of interaction

176
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.710 
with the bank. only such
kind of certificate

177
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.320 
should be accepted. and then
it's always compared with the

178
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.800 
newly delivered certificate and
if necessary, such a warning

179
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.640 
is sent and then the user has to
follow the warning and has to become

180
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.450 
aware that he or she should
not accept such a fake

181
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.760 
certificate. this are only
a few examples of the men

182
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.730 
into middle attacks. I hope
the idea that take a try

183
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:26.620 
to become a part of it, even
in secured communication,

184
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.240 
those that the users are
unaware and the attacker can

185
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.130 
see all what they are doing
and can even manipulate

186
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.870 
our deletes this data.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.870 
Lets consider identity
theft in more detail,

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.400 
what are identity data? You remember
if a user registers to service

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.240 
he has to put in a
number of data

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.890 
so it starts with his
email address then

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.020 
post address if he wants
to get things delivered,

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.580 
there are other account
details for example passport

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.750 
or ID details, there
is credit card or

8
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.120 
bank account number and all
together this is secured

9
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.240 
by the secret telephone number
by the secret of a password

10
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.800 
so the service provider remembers the
user when he puts in the username

11
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.160 
and the password. In all this
data they need to be stored

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.750 
at the service provider side and
they are stored in the user

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.280 
database, at hand of this user
database the service is able

14
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.960 
to recognize the user
and what the user

15
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.830 
did in the past. Now if a
third party possesses

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.200 
all this data possesses the
digital identity of the user

17
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.380 
the third party can act as a user
can use all the services all

18
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.930 
the resources that are
provided by the service

19
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.190 
and here has the user
authorization so for example

20
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.090 
can shop, can buy things,
can do a bank transfer

21
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.740 
he can watch videos
or others.

22
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.830 
All in the name of the owner
of the digital identity

23
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.250 
that it's used by the user or
that's misused by a third party.

24
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.660 
Unlike in the physical world
this is relatively easy

25
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.500 
to rob digital identity
and to misuse it.

26
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.010 
Identity theft is really
a very attractive goal

27
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.190 
for cybercriminals because there
are so many possibilities

28
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.420 
to misuse such digital identities
so for example with a stolen

29
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.470 
digital identity the cyber theft has
all the rights all the authorizations

30
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.010 
of the legitimate
owner.

31
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.970 
Since internet services authorize
solely on the basis of

32
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
digital identity a thief
can use the service

33
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.660 
and can use the resources that
are provided by the service

34
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.410 
at the expense of the
legitimate user.

35
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.130 
The theft of a complete user
database of an internet service

36
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.190 
is of particular interest
for cybercriminals

37
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.180 
because then they get access to
all the digital identities

38
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.030 
that are stored in that
user database and this is

39
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.750 
the identity of all the
users of this service.

40
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.800 
The cybercriminals gain
access to system

41
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.780 
of an internet service provider
and then they copy the

42
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.710 
user database with all
the identity data

43
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.290 
from its authorization
system and later on

44
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.930 
all this data can be misused.
Frequently achieved by means

45
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.420 
of so called sql injection this
is a way how cybercriminals

46
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.510 
can interact with databases
can give in some bad code

47
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.620 
that at the end provides
then the possibility

48
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.740 
to access the user database
to manipulate data

49
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.110 
to copy the data or do other
things. Data theft by malware

50
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.720 
that's another approach
cybercriminals

51
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.360 
can get access to digital
identities. There are so

52
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.360 
called spyware for example which
collects data directly from

53
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.680 
the users computer there
are identity data

54
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.300 
of course of particular
interest and

55
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.650 
identity data can be, the putting in
of identity data can be recognized

56
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.090 
by a for example filtering for
a password request or others.

57
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
There are malware so
called key loggers

58
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.660 
that read data particularly
passwords in the moment if the

59
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.930 
data are typed in into
the computer system

60
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.320 
and then the key loggers take
this data and transmit the

61
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.020 
data in parallel to
the cybercriminals.

62
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.040 
Phishing is another method
to theft identity data

63
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.530 
the users are ruled in good
face to a malicious website

64
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.570 
which pretends to be a legitimate
site there users are prompted

65
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.770 
to enter password, to enter
personal identity data

66
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.970 
and this data come
into the possession

67
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.130 
of the cybercriminals of the
owner of these fake websites.

68
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.560 
There are of course a way
to misuse social networks

69
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.090 
and forums to get access
to identity data

70
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.810 
so users may gullibly post
all data about themself

71
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.830 
including identity data into
networks such as facebook twitter

72
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.990 
and others so they are not
aware that doing this

73
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.590 
they provide the possibility for
attackers for cybercriminals

74
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.860 
to get access to this data and
later then misuse the data

75
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.390 
so any other registered user
can then view and steal

76
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.030 
the data which are published
in this social media.

77
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.440 
The theft or even the loss
of data storage devices

78
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.310 
memory sticks, laptop, smart boards
provides a possibility that

79
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.760 
attackers can get access
to this personal data.

80
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.540 
Often this stored personal identity
data is not properly protected

81
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.590 
against physical access so in
the event of a theft or loss

82
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.450 
of storage media all identity
data falls into the hands of

83
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.460 
the thief. Social engineering
I already mentioned it

84
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.030 
is a way to manipulate people
to expose their sensitive

85
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.530 
data for example to tell them
attacker is in service

86
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.030 
in service for service
stuff and needs to know

87
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.310 
to do some service the password
and then many users are

88
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.460 
willing to give the password.
The theft of identity data

89
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.020 
is really a very
important problem

90
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.960 
the internet service of the Hasso
Plattner Institute our HPI identity

91
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.220 
leak checker gives the
possibility that

92
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.440 
users can check whether their
identity data are theft and

93
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.100 
are freely available
in the internet.

94
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.300 
The service was developed
by phd students

95
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.180 
of our chair about internet
technologies and systems

96
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.460 
and the idea is to warn users
when their identity data

97
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.310 
is freely accessible
on the internet.

98
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.760 
We mentioned that
cybercriminals

99
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:03.050 
theft complete databases with
such identity data from

100
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:08.050 
internet services so typically
the users are not aware that

101
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:14.660 
their data belongs to a leaked
database, personal database

102
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.750 
and that their data are
published in the internet.

103
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.480 
With this type of service we
want to give a chance to

104
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.580 
be aware to become aware
of such data theft.

105
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.490 
We started the
service in May 2014

106
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:37.320 
it's available here is a link
of this database service

107
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.680 
so perhaps you want to
check whether your

108
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.430 
e-mail belongs to one of the
leaks and then the user

109
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.900 
get a warning so here is the user
interface you have to type

110
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.380 
in your e-mail it is clear
e-mail is part of any

111
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.110 
digital identity data
set because the

112
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.220 
channel and the usual way how to
interact with the internet.

113
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.910 
Here users can give in
their email address

114
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.090 
then they can send it to the
service and then it checkes

115
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:19.350 
whether this email address is
part of one digital identity

116
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.150 
perhaps also several digital
identities one of the leaks

117
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:30.680 
that are searched by the service
shortly after giving in

118
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.650 
the email address the user
will be informed by means

119
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.660 
of an email stating, telling
that the identity data

120
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.650 
has been found in the identity
database which was illegally

121
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.390 
and freely published in
the internet or not.

122
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.340 
In case there is a warning that's
very easy one has to change

123
00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:01.000 
the password then the digital
identity can no more

124
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.920 
misused. Here are some
experiments and some

125
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.420 
statistics we got
out of the project

126
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.340 
remember already we
started in May 2014

127
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.340 
and meanwhile we have
found 10,000 more than

128
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.160 
10,000 not digital identities,
we have found more than 10,000

129
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.970 
identity databases which are
stolen and later on freely

130
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:33.500 
published on the internet.
Sometimes these database are

131
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.230 
really large, so the largest
identity database has more than

132
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.430 
790 million
identity records

133
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.380 
almost one billion identity
data in one leak.

134
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.770 
Currently we maintain about
five billion records

135
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.490 
from more than 500 freely
accessible leaked identity

136
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:02.610 
database in the internet so
if you check whether your

137
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.140 
identity data is freely
available in the internet

138
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.580 
then more than five hundred of
these internet leaks, internet

139
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:16.340 
database leaks are
searched. The most

140
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.160 
frequently leaked data types
are email address or password

141
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.100 
a postal address, our
telephone number

142
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.170 
and particularly here
with the password

143
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.970 
we have the special
problem that many people

144
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.520 
use the same password or
slightly modified password

145
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.850 
for different services. If
the password is found

146
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.620 
then there is a large chance that
this password is also used

147
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.900 
for other services which
are not leaked before.

148
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.780 
Here is a user statistic
a diagram 2014 and

149
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:59.010 
you see that there is a lot
of warnings so we were able

150
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:05.350 
to warn more than one million people
over these years to tell them

151
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.710 
your identity data

152
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.020 
are leaked and freely
accessible in the internet.

153
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.960 
What are the motivations
for such identity theft?

154
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:21.270 
First to show reputation,
reputation of a cybercriminal

155
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.680 
that cybercriminals
want to show

156
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.870 
and want to prove that
he or she is able

157
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:33.160 
to break into internet services
and to be able to steal

158
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.540 
the user database

159
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.480 
to prove that such a theft
was successful the data

160
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.520 
is published and posted as proof
that the service was cracked.

161
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:53.530 
Of course profit interests is an
important motivation for identity

162
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.240 
theft, the data can sold very
profitable on the black market

163
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.790 
in the dark next because there
are different specializations

164
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.380 
with the cyber criminals. Some are
concentrated and specialized to

165
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.040 
theft such user database
others are specialized in

166
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.700 
misusing this data for the
some criminal purpose

167
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.260 
for example sending spam or
debiting financial service

168
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:28.290 
use of false identities in
some criminal context.

169
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.760 
Hacktivism is
another motivation

170
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.480 
so the battle of most
half-baked ideologic goals

171
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.610 
explain and say that's
right that we are

172
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:48.280 
doing this so to harm the reputation
of a victim for example political

173
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.270 
competitor or a
business company or

174
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:58.970 
others with an anonymous
background. Revenge, someone

175
00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.580 
was treated wrongly
by a person

176
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.460 
someone was treated
wrongly by a company

177
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.520 
so people like to take revenge
to steal and publish

178
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.040 
particular personal data of
that person of that company

179
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.960 
and to publish this
data in the hope

180
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:26.540 
that someone is misusing the
data to harm the person or the

181
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.240 
company. Identity theft is the real
problems there is a motivation

182
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.970 
for an attack or to do this
and this is very dangerous

183
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:41.370 
because most people are not aware
that their data, their personal

184
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.300 
identity data
was leaked.

00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:05.089 
In  our openHPI course,  "blockchain- revealing the myth" we

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.286 
want to consider blockchain application in the field of identity

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.359 
management in more detail.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.519 
This is very interesting because digital identities and the digital identity

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.579 
management is a very important part.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.726 
When we want to use a service, a digital service, first, we have

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.999 
to register in course of the registry we have to give our identity data

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.859 
to the service provider and we do not know what the service provider is doing

9
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.509 
with it. In the moment technology the service provider needs our

10
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.549 
identity data to create a digital identity, but our data are in

11
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.700 
the hand of this service provider.

12
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.450 
So identity management, independent from any third party

13
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.119 
citizen, desire to go for the most users of digital

14
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.490 
services over the years.

15
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.601 
How many accounts, how many digital identities we

16
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.214 
have for each digital service we need an

17
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.799 
own identity.

18
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.947 
So in average, you have to count.

19
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.219 
In your case, an average users have 26 and more than 26

20
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.260 
digital identities for each service he or she is using.

21
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.133 
So the objects are also linked to digital identities, for

22
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.650 
example, in the Internet

23
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.290 
of Things this is very important to

24
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.920 
address and to communicate with an object.

25
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.459 
So not only we humans need digital identities, also the objects need

26
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.280 
to clearly assign tasks to the device.

27
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.349 
So every digital identity is constructed of various

28
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.522 
sensible data that reveal information about a person or an

29
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.379 
object behind. So the name, the address,

30
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.789 
the data of bills, phone number and others, all those things are needed

31
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.910 
when you create an account

32
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.789 
account to use a service.

33
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.349 
And all this sensible data are in the hand of the service

34
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.241 
provider and you have to trust the service provider that it

35
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.870 
takes care about you, about your

36
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.127 
identity data. Often these identity data is a digital

37
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.499 
identity. Their digital entity is secured merely by

38
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.090 
a single password mechanism.

39
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.509 
So if an attacker gets a password, in a sense, he has access

40
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.050 
to all this, to all this identity data.

41
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.629 
And we have to struggle with a flood

42
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.011 
of passwords because for each account we need a new password and many

43
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.319 
people use the same password.

44
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120 
And then it's even more easy for an attacker to get access to the

45
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.957 
center data. From the user's perspective, it would be

46
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.201 
desirable to give different online services, only

47
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.524 
a partial authorization for accessing their

48
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
identity data. So.

49
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.988 
that for a certain service that to use, for example,

50
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:37.386 
some app, it's not necessary that the app knows

51
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.985 
my birthday. In another case, it's not necessary

52
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.320 
that the application knows my address.

53
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.388 
Sothe so-called self-sovereign identities, or SSI

54
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.900 
allows a user to remain in control of its own data

55
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.590 
and it allows the user to decide who is allowed to

56
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.500 
access it, which of these person in the data.

57
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.019 
So this is a very useful new concept.

58
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.468 
And by means of blockchain technology, one

59
00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.670 
can imagine implementation of that concept.

60
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.829 
So self-sovereign identities need a decentralized

61
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.179 
trust infrastructure to be established.

62
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.889 
We already know that block chain technology would provide a good candidate

63
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.949 
for such kind of decentralized trust infrastructures.

64
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.570 
However, here is one problem.

65
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.310 
The personal identity data, for example, a driver's license

66
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.959 
would perhaps not be checked when opening a bank account.

67
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.180 
But in case of a traffic control, of course the driver's license is needed

68
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.480 
and should be verifiable.

69
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.799 
So it is not enough that the data in its execution in the system

70
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.540 
cannot be manipulated.

71
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.730 
This is what, of course, the blockchain solutions provide. It is also needed

72
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.129 
is that we have mechanisms of confirmation, to get confirmation

73
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.049 
from trustworthy third party, for example, from the driver's

74
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.130 
license issuer or from the bank

75
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.649 
that this data which are shown and stored in the system are true.

76
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.309 
This is done by means of so-called claims.

77
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.630 
Claims are statements about identities, so

78
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.625 
we need an infrastructure for such an self-sovereign identities

79
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.939 
we need an infrastructure that enables us to make statements

80
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.250 
about our identity.

81
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.769 
The statements are called claims, and this claims should be

82
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.537 
verifiable by third party.

83
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.899 
And this depends from the type of data which supported this.

84
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.644 
So we have our block chain as a basic rule and

85
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.839 
then we need something which provide us the possibility and infrastructure

86
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.300 
to access verifiable and certifiable

87
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.290 
claims statements.

88
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.459 
We speak about such claims could be address, could be ownership of valid driver's

89
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.439 
license, could be credit standing, membership in chess club, a degree

90
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.939 
certification, retirements and others.

91
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.660 
So for example, if one wants to apply for a job,

92
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.059 
one gives the possibility to the user that wants to apply

93
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.949 
here in the company for a job, it gives the company

94
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.849 
the right to access its diploma.

95
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.589 
What is issued? What is an issued claim by the university?

96
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.841 
There are implementation standards for such self sovereign identities which are

97
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.269 
provided from the W3C, the World Wide

98
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.800 
Web Consortium.

99
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.709 
It has proposed foundations for the self-sovereign identities,

100
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.879 
which meanwhile became standard in the Internet, as this

101
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.529 
is the standard verifiable credentials and

102
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.084 
decentralized identifiers or DID for short.

103
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.660 
It's a verifiable credential ecosystem,

104
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.149 
which is based on that standards are the

105
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.289 
verifiable credentials are the claims, the issuer

106
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.067 
in our example, the university and the subject in our

107
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.028 
case, the learner or the people that asked

108
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.810 
for a job. They have their own unique identities.

109
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.559 
The DIDs, and the DIDs ensure that

110
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.749 
a very verifiable credentials has been issued

111
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.649 
by your issuer and has not been tampered

112
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.894 
with. So this is the basis that's an ecosystem

113
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.680 
is needed. So the individuals and organizations can generate

114
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.549 
their own identifiers as many as necessary.

115
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.750 
And this then can help to implement

116
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.220 
this idea of self sovereignty.

117
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.130 
What are the benefits of this verifiable credential ecosystem?

118
00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.059 
The SSI concept with the DIDs and the verifiable credentials

119
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.289 
is based on a decentralized infrastructure

120
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.299 
and makes the central registries obsolete.

121
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.960 
For that reason there are a number of SSI projects which

122
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.580 
are based on a blockchains, some of them using

123
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.650 
public block chains, them using a private blockchain.

124
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.070 
So it depends a little bit from what they aim to.

125
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.730 
And, you know, the difference.

126
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.169 
And you see when such projects are run one as carefully

127
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.013 
designed in the beginning, what kind of block chain model, fits

128
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.409 
best. Other projects the more potential for such

129
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:51.809 
self sovereign identities in the so-called distributed ledger technology,

130
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.990 
which is also here around in with his

131
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.600 
ideas from the block chain technology, summarizing

132
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.764 
what we have said, self-sovereign identities allow users to remain

133
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.279 
the control about the identity data.

134
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.759 
So we reconsider this as a future that we need such

135
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.645 
a popular and

136
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.291 
infrastructures that allow such self-sovereign identities.

137
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.769 
The SSI require the establishment of a decentralized trust

138
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.934 
infrastructure which allows users to make claims about the identity and

139
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.220 
the best known foundation for such an infrastructure are the

140
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.570 
verifiable credential eco-system from the

141
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.129 
World Wide Web Consortium, which offers open standards for so-called

142
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.320 
DIDs and to verify credentials and

143
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.659 
log off, such SSI projects are based

144
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.306 
on blockchain technology are based either on public or

145
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.880 
private blockchain models

146
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.132 
and other use the distributed ledger technology.

147
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.940 
We will see which of the solutions become

148
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.619 
popular and become broadly used by the people

149
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.870 
and provide in future the possibility to identify

150
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.433 
myself and have the control

151
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.120 
about my data, my identity data.

152
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.919 
Here is some literature.

153
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.470 
Who is interested in more reading about

154
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.730 
how the identity management

155
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.672 
can be based on applications

156
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.478 
of the blockchain.

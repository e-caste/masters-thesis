1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.849 
Good morning. My name is Ulrich Walter from IBM in Germany, I'm in business development

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.394 
for artificial intelligence and analytics on our IBM power systems.

3
00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:12.359 
In my second job, I'm also a senior I.T.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.799 
architect and I have a heritage of about 35 years on the usage

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689 
and development of AI Systems and Analytic systems in general.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.619 
So, what's the new hype about AI will be?

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.489 
In the next 20 minutes we will discuss the opportunities

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.019 
we see today on AI, what can be achieved with AI and also, of

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.879 
course, with other technical limitations as a possibility for what we can see

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.319 
in our economy. In the second part of our presentation, we then

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.939 
will move on and discuss about the technology that's necessary to build up an AI

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.499 
system and also, of course, the software stack and some of the challenges

13
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.299 
we see in questions of lifecycle management, orchestration and other aspects

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540 
of the usage of artificial intelligence (AI).

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.819 
So, let me start first about what is actually the impact on the economy

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.760 
from our data to knowledge and from knowledge to action.

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.329 
First of all, we are now running into a new era

18
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.519 
of computing, if you look back in history, actually when we started with client servers

19
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.109 
back in the 1990s over the World Wide Web, we are now in

20
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.499 
a situation what we are calling the cognitive era.

21
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.969 
In the cognitive era we are talking about the implementation and usage of

22
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.829 
artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and, of course, of autonomous

23
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.869 
systems. Systems that make decisions on their own based on data, immense

24
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.339 
numbers of data and what that means for the technology we will also

25
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.069 
see then in our second part of the presentation.

26
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.259 
Building up an AI system is very much of importance for the economy, but

27
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.939 
not just only for enterprises, but also in public sector, every

28
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.649 
area of our daily life will be affected by the use

29
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.599 
of artificial intelligence and will be influenced by the usage of analytics

30
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.439 
in our data, which is driven by our economy.

31
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.089 
And, of course, last not least, by ourselves as users and of course, data

32
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.869 
providers for all that endeavors.

33
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.769 
That means digitalization is one of the aspects

34
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.299 
of our roadmap towards a digital rejuvenation

35
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.369 
of enterprises in general.

36
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.199 
So that means without digitalization, we cannot make a difference

37
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.819 
in our business. We cannot actually transform ourselves or transform

38
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.079 
enterprises in new areas where they haven't been before.

39
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.429 
If you take a look in the new startups, what has happened in the last couple of years,

40
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.109 
you will see a couple of companies we probably haven't seen the 10

41
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.669 
years before. So, for example, the world's largest transportation company,

42
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.909 
they don't have any cars, which is Uber.

43
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.349 
The world's largest media company, it doesn't create any content,

44
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.209 
is Facebook. The most valuable retailer has no inventory

45
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.339 
at all, alibaba.

46
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.989 
And the world's largest accommodation's provider owns no real estate, this

47
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.990 
is Air BNB.

48
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.469 
The last not least the world's largest teleconferencing company, they have no telco

49
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.659 
infrastructure at all. That's all based on communities, on data

50
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.279 
and of course, of the usage of technologies that have not been available

51
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.259 
many years ago. And most of that stuff is driven definitely by artificial

52
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.260 
intelligence.

53
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.579 
Today of course, we are also in many areas

54
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.439 
driving AI large numbers, and especially in Germany

55
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.479 
and in Europe a very important part of that endeavor is the usage of artificial

56
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.949 
intelligence in autonomous driving and the development of autonomous systems in

57
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.719 
industry. This is really something, of course, what we can see where the future

58
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.339 
is heading to and there are new jobs created, there are

59
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.559 
a number of new possibilities to be created here in questions of developers,

60
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.179 
but also in questions of users and also new opportunities

61
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.680 
for enterprises to come.

62
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.029 
Also, smaller companies like vendors who haven't been

63
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.379 
part of that endeavor before are becoming now software providers.

64
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.029 
They are maybe building up their own software stack because they understand that

65
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.619 
software is changing the world and artificial intelligence and the analytical

66
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.409 
capabilities are part of that game.

67
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.909 
This is very important to understand that this is actually a game changer,

68
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.829 
a disruptor in the technology, but also in the way how we provide

69
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.199 
systems to our end users and customers.

70
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.349 
That means also for the economy, new jobs will be created, new profiles

71
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.409 
will be created, new partners will be created.

72
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.419 
Of course, new platforms will actually work together in automotive industry,

73
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.509 
in pharmacy, in public sector.

74
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.009 
So they are building new platforms of previous competitors

75
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.569 
will become platform providers because of the experience of data

76
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.009 
and the integration of that in question of the usage of

77
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.219 
the data for their business processes.

78
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.899 
That means also the need of having such technologies for doing that is

79
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.399 
dramatically high. That means new technologies enable

80
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.589 
especially such developments here and therefore, of course, technology

81
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.599 
plays a major part.

82
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.249 
Maybe at that point in our presentation I would make a statement that means

83
00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.319 
there is no artificial intelligence without an infrastructure architecture (IA).

84
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.109 
That means no AI without IA.

85
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.289 
In Germany alone, we expect to have our GDP in the year

86
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.789 
2030, increased by, let's say, 160

87
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.499 
billion euros alone, the accuracy, miss because of our higher

88
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.729 
performance in our systems, is going down below five percent.

89
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.529 
So we are better with artificial intelligence today than the humans

90
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.765 
can be. For example, when you do an image recognition or so.

91
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.349 
Autonomous cars, as I said before, are tremendous driver for that business

92
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.379 
and we expect to see about forty eight million of those until the year 2035.

93
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.819 
And about 70 percent of the people in Europe see AI as

94
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.289 
a positive thing. It's not always a disrupter, but it's also a

95
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.509 
positive technology that can help everyone and enable new possibilities

96
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.619 
for their daily life.

97
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.709 
In questions of jobs, I think this is also very important to understand

98
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.999 
there's a new race and a new kind of jobs coming out.

99
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.919 
So, for example, a data scientist and data analytics specialists,

100
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.389 
they are of high demand, especially in combination with industry

101
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.249 
skill, with industrial knowledge on the individual sector, in banking

102
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.369 
and finance, but also in automotive, definitely.

103
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.139 
So therefore, this is definitely something I can underline where the development

104
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.609 
is going to and be it by building up in the system we always

105
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.319 
have to consider. We need a lot of data scientists in that field in order to drive

106
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.389 
the development of applications.

107
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.559 
But on the overall data pipeline and the integration processes.

108
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.009 
There are new job roles to be created, as I said before, in each phase of

109
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.779 
our data pipeline, we have the data collection, the analytics and the data

110
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.519 
engineering part. We will see new jobs to arise here in that case,

111
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.469 
like data engineering experts, data scientist, content specialists.

112
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.269 
On the other side, you have the teams who are building and training such systems

113
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.339 
like AI software developers, AI hardware developers using FPGA's,

114
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.499 
using GPS in the servers.

115
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.509 
But a lot of other people actually have to integrate it, make the lifecycle management

116
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.209 
complete like in a traditional way.

117
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.769 
So, there is a bunch of new opportunities for jobs to be created and

118
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.538 
people who are very willing to understand that can definitely find

119
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.269 
a great place to work in that area.

120
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.199 
So, if I compare the timeline of AI development in where

121
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.849 
we are today and what has been in the past, the past, actually, there was a very

122
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.769 
narrow AI as you now call it.

123
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.449 
So, that means we could actually just do a very single simple task

124
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.119 
with the system, what we called an AI system.

125
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.709 
And to be honest, I wouldn't even call it an AI system, it was just

126
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.279 
a built on purpose system for a simple use case.

127
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.779 
Today we are a little better now, we can do more things at once with the

128
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.369 
system but I'm still not sure if it's really an AI system which means

129
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.809 
an intelligent system or if it's more or less a trained system for some special

130
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.510 
purpose, but of course with other possibilities.

131
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.709 
On the right hand side, what we see in the future,

132
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.299 
we talk about the general AI and this will be definitely

133
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.769 
a revolutionary thing to come but this is something what we are talking about,

134
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.349 
a timeline of 2050 and beyond.

135
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.209 
That means we have a combination of systems that can recognize speech, text,

136
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.028 
video, audio, and like a human being can do,

137
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.659 
understand actually everything and can reason and conclude on such

138
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.699 
endeavors and such events.

139
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.229 
And this is, of course, something we can see that this will take a long,

140
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.679 
long time to happen until we are here and that area.

141
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:19.119 
Some use cases at work today, and most of you have probably seen that before,

142
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.099 
we can do language translation, you can do it on Google, you can do it everywhere.

143
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.719 
So it shouldn't be a big deal on that speech transcription that you actually

144
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.249 
can speak to the system and the outcome could be in another language

145
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.009 
or maybe even in the written form.

146
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.039 
We have language understanding that's happening today.

147
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.639 
We have object detection today, but also face recognition.

148
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.079 
These are simple things that work today or machine reasoning, for example,

149
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.939 
for predictive maintenance. These are some of the solutions

150
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.499 
that are more or less become a very common thing in the industry and can

151
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.220 
be utilized quite easily and implemented quite easily.

152
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.530 
OK, in our second part, then we will talk about Power9

153
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:15.109 
technology and what are actually the technical enablers for that particular part to

154
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.629 
come. So with that, I close our part one and thank you for

155
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.630 
your attention.

So, the course will
be presented by

12
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.900 
Hanadi Traifeh, Salim Chujfi,
and me Tom Staubitz,

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.640 
and now that we've talked so
much about what will be

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.970 
happening in the course, we will
give you a little introduction,

15
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.540 
a little more introduction about
ourselves, so that you know

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.030 
a little bit about our backgrounds.
So let's start with Salim.

17
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.660 
Salim is the managing director
of Sabienza technologies,

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.190 
which is a Berlin-based company
specialized to support

19
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.420 
secure telecommunications
for remote teams.

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.370 
He is also a researcher at the
Hasso Plattner Institute,

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.340 
working on cognitive science
related to telecommuting.

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.570 
In the context of this cause
his mainly responsible

23
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.750 
for the organizational and cognitive
topics related to remote

24
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.080 
teamwork. Let's come to some
fun facts: he loves Latin

25
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.380 
music, he loves researching with
kids, and cooking Arab dishes.

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.270 
And now, you won't believe that,
he even married remotely.

27
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
In a yellow telephone box. You
remember these, maybe if

28
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.050 
you're old enough, these old telephone
boxes that used to stand around

29
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.380 
everywhere. He actually was
using a 'Go-Bananas' prepaid

30
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.570 
card. Believe it or not, he's still
married to the same woman... yeah

31
00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.370 
exactly... Ok, now let me present you
Hanadi, Hanadi a Design Thinking

32
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.470 
coach and researcher at the
HPI-Stanford Design-Thinking Research

33
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.110 
Program. Her expertise it is
in this digital learning,

34
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.640 
human centered design, and
visual communication.

35
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.890 
In the context of this course,
she will be mainly responsible

36
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.520 
for the intercultural
competence in week three.

37
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.630 
Well, if we talk about some
facts on Hanadi she has a

38
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.190 
lot to do with teamwork, specially
at home with her twins:

39
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.640 
six year old boys. Problem
solving, I believe

40
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.930 
you are absolutely good at...
Absolutely ... There is something

41
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.390 
even more interesting about
Hanadi: since he was born, she

42
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.470 
has never lived in one single place
for more than three years...

43
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.750 
Sometimes not in the same city,
not in the same country....

44
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.690 
Come on, imagine, now she is
really a natural remote.

45
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.830 
So who is Tom? Tom is a researcher
at the Hasso Plattner Institute,

46
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.060 
he's focusing in his work on teamwork,
and collaborative learning

47
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.340 
in a large scale learning
environments. He is part of the

48
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.950 
openHPI Team and so far has
conducted several courses on

49
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.460 
Java programming, which often
included team assignments and team

50
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.890 
tasks, right? In the context of
this course he will mainly

51
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.770 
be responsible for week one.
He will be introducing

52
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.710 
tools and technologies to
support remote collaboration.

53
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.420 
Some facts about Tom: his favorite
musicians are the Stranglers,

54
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.800 
Blondie, and Willie Nelson. He
learned a lot about teamwork

55
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.420 
by being the drummer of several
bands, he no longer drums...

56
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.380 
A little bit sometimes ... but
not for us ... not for you.

57
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.320 
Not in the course, you won't
see me doing that... But,

58
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.500 
get this, his most extreme experience
with team collaboration and

59
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.920 
team work was through, living in
a shared housing with twenty-

60
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.860 
eight people sharing one
bathroom and one kitchen!

61
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.500 
For about three or four years.
Oh, my god, and you survived?

62
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.990 
Yeah, I did, and it was
fun!.... Absolutely...

63
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.930 
So now that we've presented
ourselves, we would like

64
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.460

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.390 
Welcome to our new
openHPI course

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.710 
"Confidential Communication
in the Internet".

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.280 
In this course we want to
discuss the question how

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.560 
internet communication can be
organized in such a way that

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.390 
the content we transport
over the internet

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.410 
remains confidential.

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.780 
Because the internet is an open
network, so it is insecure, it is

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.610 
unsafe communication and let's
start with an example about that.

9
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:42.370 
A year ago there was a leak from
g0d, the Criminal Advent

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.820 
Calendar. It was published in
December two thousand eighteen

11
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.740 
and in that leak hackers published
confidential data of celebrities,

12
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.060 
of politicians, of famous
actors, musicians

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.320 
and they did it
via twitter.

14
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.730 
And what they were able to
publish is to publish

15
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.540 
data that includes very personal information,
so lists of mobile phone numbers,

16
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.410 
a list of home addresses, personal address
directories, emails, facebook chats,

17
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.110 
copies of ID cards, photo scan.
It was a shock, it was a shock

18
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.820 
for all the public people
and the politicians.

19
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.160 
They are startled. How could this
happen? How was it possible that an

20
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.380 
unauthorized hacker got access
to such very personal data.

21
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.600 
And the problem, it was analyzed. The
problem which was found out was

22
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.770 
that there were no awareness of the
problem of internet security.

23
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.890 
There were no awareness of the need
of data security as a cornerstone

24
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.160 
of our digital society. So people
used it without thinking that

25
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.000 
it's important to secure the
data, that was not easy

26
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.350 
to get this data in unauthorized
hands and it's also not easy

27
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.700 
to read and understand
the data.

28
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.300 
So the politics came up and created a
framework of conditions. There were data

29
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.340 
protection laws and others but the
individual people, they must form,

30
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.610 
they must follow these regulations. He
must inform himself and take measures

31
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.020 
to him or herself. And this is very
important and this is what we want to

32
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.970 
teach in this course. That
we want to offer an intro

33
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.560 
into the confidential communication in
the internet. What needs to be done

34
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.570 
to make the data which I send
over the open internet

35
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.890 
to secure us in such a way
that no one else, none

36
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.160 
other person is able to get access
to understand what's going on.

37
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.410 
There are many such spectacular
hacker attacks. Here

38
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500 
attack, the so
called CEO fraud

39
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.540 
because it's the

40
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.380 
hacker sent
falsified mails.

41
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.500 
The sender seems to be
the CEO of the company

42
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.560 
and sends to the people and then
the CEO told them to do that.

43
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.750 
But in reality it's a hacker
which sends an email

44
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.320 
that has the sender
address of the CEO.

45
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.820 
There were some big cases. For
example in two thousand eighteen

46
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.230 
in Germany, Karlsruhe
Regional Court

47
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.990 
decided that the Sparkasse, a
German bank, is liable for the

48
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.720 
transfer of about one
point seven million Euro

49
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.810 
which was sent by an accountant
that has executed, which was

50
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.790 
executed by an accountant after he
got a fake message from his boss.

51
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.750 
Or in August two thousand sixteen, some
similar incidents. A Chinese Austrian

52
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.350 
aircraft component
manufacturer, the

53
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.710 
FACC AG loses fifty million,
fifty million Euros

54
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.270 
on the basis of such a CEO fraud. Or
the Bavarian automotive supplier

55
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.330 
Leoni loses forty million Euros.
You see it's really important

56
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.880 
and the reason is that it's easy
to manipulate mails which

57
00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.830 
are sent in clear text, it is easy to
change the sender address. This is

58
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.860 
some shortage of the internet
protocols. So what we want to discuss

59
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.310 
in this course is that with the
use of cryptographic means

60
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.490 
such cases, so called digital signatures
in this case of mentioned CEO fraud

61
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.980 
by means of so-called digital signatures.
This is one of the cryptographic means

62
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.490 
such hacking attacks could
have been avoided.

63
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.990 
Generally the digital
transformation

64
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.250 
is characterized by the omnipresence of
the internet and the world wide web.

65
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.440 
In all what we doing

66
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.540 
digital technologies internet
services the world wide web as

67
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.300 
services play an important role
and change our world, change our

68
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.990 
behavior in the private life, change our
business life, change our social life.

69
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.900 
And so we have to understand how internet
and the world wide web is working.

70
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.520 
And not only here to the promises of this
new global communication technology

71
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.270 
and this promises say
almost cost-free

72
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.410 
and worldwide communication is
possible within the internet

73
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.760 
or media without
borders.

74
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.300 
All information are available
everywhere and any time.

75
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.530 
Even the democratic access is
discussed and is seen

76
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.040 
as something good which is brought by the
internet and the new digital technologies.

77
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:54.070 
But the internet and world wide web also
offer entrance gates for multiple threats.

78
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.650 
I mentioned already some
of these hack attacks.

79
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.270 
So there are very
different reasons

80
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.720 
which help the
hackers and which

81
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.430 
provides the possibility of
such threats in the digital world.

82
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.510 
There is faulty software, or the hardware,
network is not working correctly,

83
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.870 
there are inadequate
internet protocols. I just mentioned

84
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.640 
that it's so easy to manipulate
an address, is a reason that

85
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.940 
there are in the IP protocol,
there are no authentication

86
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.190 
features
to prevent this.

87
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.430 
There are malware like computer
viruses, worms or trojans

88
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:48.190 
which provide attackers a possibility
to receive unauthorized

89
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.700 
information or to interact with
the system of the victim

90
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.170 
or with his or her data.

91
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.420 
Incorrect operations

92
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.330 
by being lazy or by
not understanding what to do,

93
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.360 
installing something in the wrong
way or have a wrong configuration.

94
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.610 
So in many many cases careless
users are the reason

95
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.050 
that there it's so multiple
threats in the internet.

96
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.750 
Unauthorized users, hackers,
attackers, cybercriminals they

97
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.710 
try and use digital means to break
into computer systems of the users,

98
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.480 
to break into computer systems
of a company,

99
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:42.900 
reading information and find out some details
about some developments in a company

100
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.290 
or in a discussion
in another

101
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.890 
state to espionage
these things.

102
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:57.340 
To falsifications of message, to manipulate
sender address we already discussed.

103
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.000 
Manipulate the content

104
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.140 
or the misdirection of emails.
This is only a small list. I

105
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.370 
could add many more which shows
that this new technology, the

106
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.840 
internet and the world wide web have
a lot of new multiple threats.

107
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.670 
And the more our life is using
these new digital technologies,

108
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.240 
the more we
should be aware

109
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.330 
about the threat and we should
think about how we can secure us.

110
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.300 
And what is clear
the threats rise,

111
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.280 
the more all parts of our world are
interconnected by the internet.

112
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:46.080 
Then even in the past some criminal
has to physically break into

113
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.580 
a flat or in
the company's

114
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.790 
office.
But today

115
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.890 
this is possible via
the internet.

116
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.340 
So the information
transmission in the internet

117
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.230 
is endangered
in many ways.

118
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.070 
So a central point
is confidentiality.

119
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.950 
Confidentiality of the messages
is when we transport a

120
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.470 
message, email or another
data through the internet

121
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.490 
is not secured,
internet is open

122
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.590 
as long as we do not

123
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.680 
take measures
to prevent this.

124
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.970 
So data
packages which

125
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.460 
is a typical way that information are
communicated in the internet, they contain

126
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:48.850 
the message or part of the message and when
they are transported through the internet,

127
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.530 
they are transported from one network
to another network, you remember

128
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.440 
internet is a network of networks
and these different networks

129
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.880 
are connected
by routers.

130
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.540 
And who has access to
the router, who has

131
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:10.460 
access to all the data that are
transported via this router

132
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.550 
and has the chance to
manipulate this.

133
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.040 
It is possible to
manipulate sender,

134
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.250 
sender name or address.

135
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.900 
It can be forged. It's possible
to manipulate the content

136
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:34.450 
of a message. A message can be
uploaded with hidden malware

137
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.190 
to do some wrong activities
on the receiver sides

138
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.360 
and much more dangerous

139
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.640 
and threaten the communication
in the internet.

140
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:53.060 
So what we need are mechanisms to ensure
information security and

141
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.120 
confidentiality
in the internet.

142
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.270 
We have to think what
are the goals to secure

143
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.760 
when securing our information,
our internet traffic.

144
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:13.470 
And there are different such security
goals which have to be achieved

145
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.020 
to use the internet
in a secure way.

146
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.280 
So we have to ensure the
confidentiality of the messages.

147
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.980 
This is our main focus
in this course.

148
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.460 
With this one can prevent
forgeries of the sender.

149
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.130 
One can uncover
manipulation of messages.

150
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.630 
One can prevent the
denial of online orders.

151
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.980 
These are securities and we have to
look for the measures

152
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.280 
we can use to
reach these goals.

153
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:56.400 
And the most tools to reach the security
goals in the internet come from

154
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.650 
cryptography. Cryptography
and cryptographic methods -

155
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:07.780 
this is the science, an old science,
for ensuring information security.

156
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:14.740 
It already is older than two
thousand years. All the Romans used

157
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.780 
encrypted messages to
secure the confidentiality

158
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:28.140 
but by means of new technology the
need for the methods from cryptography

159
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.170 
have increased, have very
very much increased.

160
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.020 
So with the help of these cryptographic
methods, one can ensure

161
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.410 
the confidentiality
of messages.

162
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.060 
One can detect forgery, one
can detect manipulation

163
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.140 
of the content of the message, one
can detect forgery of the sender

164
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.690 
of a message and one can
detect unfair behavior

165
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:02.590 
of an online purchaser. So these
are only a few of the things,

166
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:09.870 
the few of the wanted
security means, we

167
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:17.160 
want to see guaranteed when we are using
the internet and cryptography

168
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.390 
is providing the
tools to that.

169
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:29.180 
So here we see our sender, we
have our receiver and they are

170
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.900 
connected by the internet and the sender
wants to send a message to the receiver.

171
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.300 
Typically the sender
is Alice and

172
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.480 
the receiver is Bob and
so Alice writes

173
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:50.240 
a message and then she used a cryptographic
method here and hash algorithm

174
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.500 
and then she is using
an encryption method

175
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.430 
and then the
message is signed

176
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.420 
and encrypted. And it is sent
via the internet to Bob

177
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.860 
and Bob now can, he

178
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:14.020 
is the only one who can understand the
message because the encryption method

179
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.980 
key that is needed to
encrypt this message

180
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:25.080 
only these two are knowing and
by means of the hash algorithm

181
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.970 
we can also the signature
mechanism introduce.

182
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.210 
We have to discuss this in much
more detail and this is what

183
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:42.020 
we want to do in our course. So in the
openHPI course it runs over two weeks.

184
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:48.720 
The first week is January
thirteenth to January nineteenth

185
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.210 
and in the first week which is
starting now, we introduce the

186
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.410 
topic, we will discuss threats,
we will discuss security goals

187
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.610 
that need to be guaranteed
and then we introduce

188
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:09.050 
cryptographic methods. There are two groups
of cryptographic methods - symmetric

189
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.940 
cryptography and methods of
asymmetric cryptography,

190
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.430 
and to better
understand this

191
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:22.090 
how it's organized, we also discuss
some famous examples. Some

192
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.530 
famous examples from
the internet, the DES

193
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.680 
encryption, the AES
encryption, hash function,

194
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.280 
RSA  and then
we round up

195
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:40.110 
this discussion by discussing
cryptographic protocols and attacks.

196
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.210 
And then in the
next week

197
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.070 
starting January twentieth
to January twenty sixth,

198
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:51.620 
then we will discuss in more
details crypto-protocol

199
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:58.010 
which is used for encryption, which is
used to guarantee the confidentiality.

200
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.980 
Then we will discuss
the crypto protocol

201
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.170 
digital signature which is

202
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.290 
used to guarantee the
integrity of information that

203
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:16.480 
are sent over the internet. And then we discuss
public key infrastructures and trust center

204
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.500 
that are needed, for example when
you want to do online banking. It

205
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.810 
happens in the back, so typically
you are not aware of such

206
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.280 
kind of technology that
runs in the back

207
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.270 
and this technology is based on the
usage of digital certificates.

208
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:42.350 
And then we will finish our
week by introducing PGP.

209
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.630 
PGP is a tool set that which helps
to secure the email traffic.

210
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:55.150 
There are some literature if you want to
or if you are interested in more details.

211
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.620 
Of course in our course we
can only introduce things.

212
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.390 
There is a book by Harald Sack
and me "Digital Communication"

213
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.600 
which was published in
the Springer book.

214
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.830 
There is a lot of
material available

215
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.390 
that can be read to

216
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:20.010 
deepen and this
Digital Communication is the

217
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.220 
first volume of a
trilogy

218
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.730 
of Harald and me which is

219
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.100 
going about internetworking and
web technology so it describes

220
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.500 
what we are discussing
in the course.

221
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.820 
My name is Christoph Meinel. I am
the Institute director and dean

222
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:49.820 
of the Hasso Plattner Institute. I have a chair
about internet technologies and system

223
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:57.430 
and the co-workers and researchers and PhD
students of the chair support me

224
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.900 
in preparing the courses,
in running the courses

225
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:07.140 
and in our research we are
focusing on security engineering,

226
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.180 
for example such
technologies like

227
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.170 
that will be presented here in
the course, but also digital

228
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.430 
education is something that's
very interesting for me and

229
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:26.860 
the openHPI system and the partner
systems were developed in my chair.

230
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.660 
So digital education is
an important point also

231
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:37.320 
in Germany the HPI Schul-cloud it's a
project of us. And then this course

232
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.350 
you remember we will
offer three

233
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.340 
two weeks course to different
aspects of internet security

234
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.350 
and this course about confidential
communication is supported by Daniel Köhler

235
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.570 
and by Ali Alhosseini.

236
00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:02.580 
Both are PhD students. Daniel is
working in security engineering

237
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.910 
doing his research in
network security and Ali

238
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:13.780 
works on social media analytics and
is involved in big data security

239
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.050 
projects about
attack crafts.

240
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:25.790 
So we are happy to have you with us.
We hope you will be interested in

241
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.790 
getting more information, more
knowledge about confidential

242
00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.460 
communication in
the internet.

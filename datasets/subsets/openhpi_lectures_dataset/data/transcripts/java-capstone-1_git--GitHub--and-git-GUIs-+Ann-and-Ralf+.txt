WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.950 
as an example we prepared
to the repository for you

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.580 
say this is actually acts
like a repository so this

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.840 
repository basically contains the
cadence lights of weak intro

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.700 
and one at the time given and
we want to do now is actually

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.970 
claimed is repository that basically
means that we get a full

6
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.380 
copy of the foot repository
and all machine

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.050 
including all the is right yeah
so what we need to do is click

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.640 
on clone here and then we actually
use the option t dan by

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.590 
s h so you can also done
that says it of course

10
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.200 
that for on like
real everything

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.610 
as h is the choice so what they
do the is go to the place where

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.330 
we actually want to clone that
repository to so like some full

13
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.950 
there somewhere on your computer
i'm actually type gets client

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.810 
and zero yeah and then
it's ice climbing into

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.080 
this like repository
i and shape

16
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.210 
because there are tricks
that it's really you

17
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.950 
yeah say this basically verifies i
it would do will thing inference

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.310 
sender that this is really meeting
all the changes i'm doing

19
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.230 
say now i have to positively
yes say i can actually

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.710 
go into the folder and in that
type as short for that list

21
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.790 
of things i can say a license a
reply and in source we have

22
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.990 
all the source code so
if i would go days to

23
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.980 
go for let's say the
intro i have profiles

24
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.270 
and it's basically it so now we
want to do something that right

25
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.450 
we could develop worse and we
want to change something so

26
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.340 
probably i don't know what we want
to change but we could change

27
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.020 
you read before just the purpose
of changing something yeah

28
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.250 
so let's do that and say what
do you want to write here

29
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.290 
source to use those
words you didn't

30
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.690 
really state which weeks are in
the coastal real already so

31
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
probably we want to know
that okay are we ensure

32
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.710 
and leak wand
are currently

33
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.060 
la a year so they have so yeah
that should be a so let's just

34
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.040 
say well known what do
we need to do with it

35
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.570 
say we want c c you have
changes or not and to

36
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.050 
another to do that we can type
that used to get to steps yes

37
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.570 
and we see that we are
on the branch master

38
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.320 
and step we actually have
twenty five five reach me and

39
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.780 
dot and d say my don't file
yeah so there no changes

40
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
to the community so we
haven't at a new filence

41
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.320 
we have just changed existing
front and it also says they are

42
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.240 
much not stage for commit yet so
probably if we want to commit

43
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.820 
so if you want to make them
in the long term available

44
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.500 
to others build first to
commit them to all own

45
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.530 
yeah repository to
old copy yeah

46
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.950 
we would did as with we get as
many founding that maybe we

47
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.630 
did a feature branch first ok so
this is a definitely new feature

48
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.610 
that we state has a really big
and nobody out like many people

49
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.920 
are currently editing this
repository obviously

50
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.140 
say i've there are different ways
of doing all the things i'm

51
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.240 
doing right now i say this
is just one of them

52
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.160 
and how do we actually
want to call range

53
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.300 
let's call the
branch where it to

54
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:51.360 
read you or as groups so now if
i type get status or did as

55
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.510 
t that's like a forecast for
me because i'm really lazy

56
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.140 
you can see that i'm on
the branch as a great me

57
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.340 
so that worked and i
can date as we said

58
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.980 
deed as anti farming said this
would be do we need that and he

59
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.340 
and now i don't see anything
because yeah now we see that we

60
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.820 
have added so that's great tool
the commit we're going to do

61
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.120 
right yes a next step would be to
create a commit so that would

62
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
mean to kind of say ok these
are changes that are ready to

63
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.810 
be published and we would kind
of do them in one commits and

64
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.890 
then i published and we
already know commuters

65
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.590 
commit message it has
an author turks so

66
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.550 
in this case it's you and times
them when it was from it so

67
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.210 
so i typed it commits
in order to do that

68
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.700 
and i actually and as you can
and want to emma message right

69
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.430 
here so at the day the

70
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.590 
weeks in there

71
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
not best commitments as i animates
motherless you have one

72
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.890 
we tried right so i can have to
hate returned again and we

73
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.070 
still see i say i type
gets that is again

74
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.960 
and i see it that i
actually am on branch and

75
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.430 
it read may nothing to
connect working trickling

76
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.940 
so no you committed and
i can already see you

77
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.980 
to no say as we sat
everybody has a full copy

78
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.430 
of the repository that only things
that publish the right now

79
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.200 
to changes are only on my machine
i have to still publish them

80
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.720 
to the world and given to you all
the other people that might

81
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.580 
be super interested in
these famous repository

82
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.400 
that your famous commute has
obviously and i really great right

83
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.290 
so in other cities or the push or
changes from a local computed

84
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.380 
to all the people
say somewhere well

85
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.890 
called stored but not least all
the people who were checked

86
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.170 
out that specific problem should
so it might have been that

87
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.830 
play changes might have been
introduced to the price they have

88
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.610 
published so then we would type
get pull first i would still

89
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.200 
be massive branch and get
all the changes first

90
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.420 
that as his branches only local only
my machine that is superfluities

91
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.590 
here so the just pull it
doesn't were always do it

92
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.720 
regardless whether there is
something to pull i'm not

93
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.880 
okay you need to you to
read you prosecute

94
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.260 
yet so the thing is that there's
obviously no branch on

95
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.860 
the upstream on the
server because it's you

96
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.970 
look exactly that is why the
actually would have to push that

97
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.780 
first all specify branch
from what you wanted

98
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.470 
pull so it might be the
easiest to actually just

99
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.930 
publish or first because
obviously nobody

100
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.620 
can have or
changes right

101
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.810 
say i actually has this had
the upstream branch first

102
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.510 
and type that and you you just a
set of human then you to religion

103
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.560 
and then use that you stated
the name branch or the name

104
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.320 
to be on the server
yeah exactly

105
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.540 
what that reducing so originally
is actually direction of our

106
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.070 
repository so this is the server
it has other code this is

107
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.460 
called the reaction and we have
a local copy allow machine

108
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.480 
and they might be different
upstream souther so

109
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.010 
to say that right now there is
only one and that is our poverty

110
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.320 
and knowledge so the branch it
we mean this set up to check

111
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.970 
the remote branch review
from richard so

112
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.780 
now they are called the same and
your branch it re just rolls

113
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.880 
it read me on the so right yeah
so thank type get as t again

114
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.430 
for the stack is then you branches
up to date with origin our

115
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.050 
at that we set that's amazing
you already push the whole

116
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.610 
brand with you changes in
really really exactly

117
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.830 
say and i can also get go
to different rationale

118
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.870 
and that changes and so on so
forth because now i have like

119
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:21.660 
clean tree with no falls at that
maybe let's head other to

120
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.140 
get happen seem of a
branch really pete there

121
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.920 
say i'm here i can do
that is showed this

122
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.530 
yet say here we have x now two
branches and there was one before

123
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.770 
and we have a weekly push one
mitigate and they can actually

124
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:42.010 
take on compare and put a crest
and i actually won't have that

125
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.870 
most now master branch so the
main branch half your features

126
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.910 
ready it tends to be the most of
say i can create a polar crest

127
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.140 
we can see changes down here and
then it checks where we're

128
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.840 
like if we have test them if they
do ran obviously it's only

129
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.880 
text so yeah probably show the
changes again that was a little

130
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.640 
bit far yet say if i go to the
commits tap i can go to every

131
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.980 
single comments that i push
second also could vastly ok you

132
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.450 
receive again so he could
one committed or the

133
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.630 
one you just did we've got your
your tech in there so i can

134
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.860 
cause them and that was committed
four minutes ago so yeah

135
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.730 
and on the net inside and
see what was like there

136
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.100 
before they delete it and on the
right inside i can see what

137
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.220 
was added say you can see these
one and read because at

138
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.300 
point here like at a period at
the end of and so that is why

139
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.940 
it's kind of track the changes
the eating that the sentence

140
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.910 
and then adding and and you
that's the way get us figs

141
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.610 
and if one type it's review
changes you can see all the

142
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.220 
changes and say ok it makes sense
or as i totally wrong because

143
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.180 
you already obviously had
we to in here or not

144
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.000 
and and then i actually
can merciful request

145
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:08.380 
and conferred match and that's
it and now if i had overt see

146
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.710 
my code again i
can actually

147
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.730 
see re right here and see my
changes were already there is

148
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.790 
no amazing also say there
is a nice overview

149
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.680 
of all the changes that
ever happened here

150
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.910 
you were quite busy literally
and all the branches

151
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.780 
that exists there and what
the contributors were and

152
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.160 
which licence it has
also and so forth so

153
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.050 
that's a really nice
things also gets up

154
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.950 
the only tool although you can
also use like good glad for

155
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.320 
your own good luck on your own so
already market from a glassy

156
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.190 
and so there are many
different options

157
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.850 
and this is remind that our get
up was curl previously acquired

158
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.830 
by microsoft like a
couple of weeks ago

159
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.430 
and so that actually shows how poor
it is right now for development

160
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:09.490 
i like it and yeah we did
some changes and obviously

161
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.590 
looking the command-line
ease not always

162
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.620 
the best choice for all people
so i actually prefer work in

163
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.200 
the command-line because they can
always specify what exactly

164
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.130 
and doing and no there and i
prefer graphical user interfaces

165
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.750 
so that a good nice clean
overview him don't

166
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.790 
type that many say yes i doubt that
they meant different program

167
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.700 
is preferred different reconcile
and it's totally ok to favor

168
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.490 
one of enough and that and maybe
we shape our our learning

169
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.050 
is not actually a gooey
for it would be yeah so

170
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.330 
one three at least
to tula source

171
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.410 
trees there we can also
introduce the repository

172
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.940 
we already checked or work
on the command line

173
00:11:53.260 --> 00:12:02.010 
so we just go there say per gram
and kate as a repository i

174
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:07.520 
hit and that we had and then we
can just go into by double

175
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.800 
clicking and then we'll once
again ce all the commits there

176
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.220 
are in the in the top view we
see on the right-hand side on

177
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.110 
the bottom the actual changes
that have been done

178
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.690 
on the left hand side we see e
r the also take the commit

179
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.990 
hash when it was the was
which labels its associated

180
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.900 
to commit message yeah can you say
it's also a great ca spanish

181
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.980 
say i have checked my changes
actually i'm doing because that's

182
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.870 
nice of you i know the also to
command like to do that actually

183
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:47.270 
five like me over there but i
actually prefer typing commands

184
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.820 
and what we what we also see of
the currently you are on the

185
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.460 
on the branch read me on
the left hand side you

186
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.890 
know you no chuckle that were i
would just want to show i know

187
00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.740 
you would like to master exactly
say now i it changed the mass

188
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.720 
of ramsay if i would not
go to the file actually

189
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.590 
we've the read me and read
me wooden shale our senses

190
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.480 
because it's only and
that's commit and

191
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.490 
obviously as you can see that
isn't how it should look like

192
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.910 
right because we have the
mass transfer on troy

193
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.760 
whereas it reflected yet because
we haven't pull the chain

194
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.980 
say my we did is now a degree
of tectic call on the command

195
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.130 
line or just hit full here and
i input from the repository

196
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.180 
origin again from you
from age branch master

197
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:40.480 
and click on ok and now you could
think of why it why isn't

198
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.080 
it reflected to use so we
did or the changes here

199
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.530 
yes we did all the changes
you but we push them

200
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.490 
to the branch also learned we
merge them on the circle so

201
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.340 
local copy doesn't
yet know that we

202
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.000 
marched it so we need to pull
once again and then also all

203
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.640 
local copy should exactly and
we could also emerged branch

204
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.990 
on or look machine that
wouldn't have been issue

205
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.110 
and now to successor right this
so what you can see here is

206
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.480 
that all branch is known wrecks
because it's like easier to

207
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.310 
distinguish obviously and gliese
en masse to branch and we

208
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.080 
can say that i started
here as to branch off

209
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.800 
and then merge them back
together and we can see also

210
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.370 
the change that
i countries

211
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.270 
now that you know how to
get around would get

212
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.550 
one more guideline for use
so whatever a dangerous

213
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.960 
situation occurs for example fire
just press did commit then

214
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.240 
don't forget to push it's really
important and then leave the

215
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.410 
say not take that too
seriously it's just

216
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.810 
one of the main takes programming
about it and importance of

217
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.850 
it in their life say read
it is really great

218
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.780 
as is that and biased say i did
some research and look for

219
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.230 
many resources that might help you
to get started with it because

220
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.110 
as i sat it's
really great and

221
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.350 
say this is what i would suggest
like as a starting points

222
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.390 
to get started and if you really
want to become a professional

223
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.590 
software developer i choose the
version control system of your

224
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.630 
choice basically all ever
accompanied you're working for is

225
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.160 
using but it is super important
if you want to progress further

226
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.020 
into program

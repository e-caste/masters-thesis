00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.270 
Ladies and gentlemen I'd like to
welcome you to the video clip

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.530 
Introduction to Signavio process
Manager. My name is Johannes,

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.370 
I'm working as I’m a global
team lead at Signavio and

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.750 
in this video I like to show you how
to use a Signavio process manager

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.290 
and the different parts for modeling,
for analysis but also to structure

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
your diagrams.

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.220 
Signavio is a balloon
headquartered company for process

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.860 
mining for modeling but also for process
execution and process automation.

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.700 
Therefore we have four product on the
market in this video we talk about

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.260 
the process manager or basically
the entire courses about

11
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.500 
the process manager but you
can also publish your processes

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.090 
on a centralized platform to
provide transparency about the

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.730 
process landscapes and structure where
other people can drill down to

14
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.280 
the actual process they
are working with.

15
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.070 
Processes can be also where process
models can be also used to

16
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.250 
be automated, therefore we offer
the Signavio Workflow

17
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.470 
Accelerator which is a light weighted
lightweight workflow component

18
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.370 
which can simply execute
BPMN process models.

19
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.380 
And there is also the process
intelligence product on the markets

20
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.630 
which allows us to I would
say capture analyze

21
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.440 
data coming from external systems like
SAP for example transaction data

22
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.720 
which can be analyzed and placed
over the existing process

23
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.400 
model in order to find differences
between how the process

24
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.000 
actually do in the systems and how the
process how the process should be done

25
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.870 
Provided or described
by the model.

26
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.820 
If you already have an existing
account, Signavio account you

27
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.870 
can go onto the website on the upper
right corner there's a small

28
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.340 
login button which allows
you to choose which product

29
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.640 
you want to login. If you don't
have an existing account and you

30
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.150 
want to register
for a new one,

31
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.010 
I recommend you to go to
The site signavio.com/openhpi

32
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.220 
which forwards
you to the registration form.

33
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.020 
The benefit here is if you use
the extension openHPI

34
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.920 
your trial period
will be extended by thirty

35
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.960 
further days. Usually the trial
period would be thirty days

36
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.790 
when you register for it may be
a trial account you will have

37
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.590 
sixty days to play around and
figure out what features are.

38
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.880 
This looks like this one
after filling out the form.

39
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.680 
You can simply
Try Signavio

40
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.310 
and log into your
existing workspace.

41
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.560 
And after login every
workspace looks like this

42
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.820 
one on the left side you
have the full structure you

43
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.650 
might already know that from
windows it's the same behavior.

44
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.720 
You click on the folder you
want to you want to use.

45
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.650 
You can already see in the middle
that the content will be

46
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.940 
will be shown

47
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.720 
and you can simply click on what
type of content or what

48
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.250 
diagram you
want to work with.

49
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.470 
There's also another section
which it's a little bit

50
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.240 
hidden but when you open the
bar on the bottom the feed

51
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.350 
bar on the bottom you can see
that there is a preview of

52
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.580 
the process.

53
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.590 
And we also have a feed which
tracks everything which happens

54
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.610 
with a folder or also with a
process from the beginning

55
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.350 
on up to the or until the current
point in time.

56
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.810 
The top bar has some buttons
included has some features

57
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.800 
included to I would say to
create new processes, to edit

58
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.210 
existing ones, move, copy, delete - whatever
you want to do also to import

59
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.410 
other processes or
pictures also possible

60
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.370 
reporting processes is
what we will learn

61
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.550 
in a week five but also share an existing
process with other people and invite

62
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.350 
them to provide
feedback.

63
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.770 
For now I just want to create a
new process means I click on

64
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.340 
the folder at first
in which I want to

65
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.100 
I wanted to create
the new process.

66
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.770 
As you can already see here
it's not always BPMN you

67
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.970 
can also create a DMN process
journey map organizational

68
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.110 
chart what ever you need
but for this course

69
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.530 
we will focus on business
process diagrams.

70
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.980 
Clicking on the poster diagram
opens a new tab which shows now

71
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.390 
the editor of the Signavio
process manager.

72
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.360 
The editor is also divided
into several parts.

73
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.010 
The left side is always where it contains
always the BPMN elements in need.

74
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.450 
The top part has also some
features included which I want to

75
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.070 
explain a bit later and the right
side is always the attributes bar

76
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.240 
which can be shown and you
can place attributes

77
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.690 
further information behind the
process or behind activities

78
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.820 
so for each single element, you can use
the attributes bar tool provides

79
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.050 
some kind of information
whatever you need.

80
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.120 
When we start with process
modelling I would

81
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.140 
always start with not with a
statement I would start with a

82
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.450 
pull into lane for example to define
the responsibilities of a process.

83
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.470 
And here would say we
simply use the pool lane

84
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.300 
element from the left side drag and
drop it to the canvas in the middle and

85
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.060 
the system already asked me to provide
a name for the pool.

86
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.830 
So the organization in which
the process takes place.

87
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.780 
Example.

88
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.780 
Now the process takes place
in this company example

89
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.270 
in company here and in the lame
section we need to provide

90
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.080 
the actual responsibilities. So
all responsibilities in the

91
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.790 
process needs to be placed
in lanes or via lines

92
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.630 
and one of them would be for example
the customer service department.

93
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.420 
So always double click

94
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.670 
allows you to enter
the naming section.

95
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.710 
If I want to add another lane now
to the existing one I still

96
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.650 
use the same element
pool slash lane

97
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.700 
drag and drop it into the
canvas and with existing lane

98
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.700 
they can choose where they want
to place the new lane insert

99
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.090 
the lane above or inside the
lane below the existing ones.

100
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.550 
The new line would be
another department.

101
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.180 
Therefore we talk about here the
warehouse so we have now in

102
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.500 
the example company
two responsibilities.

103
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.210 
One of them is the department for
customer service the other one

104
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.320 
see warehouse.

105
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.180 
Now we could start modelling
the process actually.

106
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.300 
So every process starts with a
Start event. Therefore as

107
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.890 
I mentioned drag-and-drop
had simple

108
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.150 
place to start element directly
in the customer service lane

109
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.940 
because a process starts
a customer service by

110
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.640 
an incoming
order. So the

111
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.350 
Start event can be named
as order received.

112
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.610 
And it's not always drag and drop
I mean you can also if you

113
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.190 
want to describe that now an activity
needs to follow it you can also use the

114
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.930 
activity drag and drop it and connected
elements but I would rather recommend you

115
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.560 
to use the context menu. This can
be used by clicking on

116
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.010 
an existing element
and simply choose what

117
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.890 
BPMN
needs to follow.

118
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.820 
When you click on
the task here

119
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.200 
I can easily add further task as
many as needed and which is

120
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.380 
much more convenient instead of a
drag and drop it already to the

121
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.600 
canvas and connected manually. You
can see that these elements

122
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.730 
are connected
automatically.

123
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.690 
And what happens after the
company has received an order?

124
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.380 
I would say the customer
service need to enter

125
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.300 
the order details.

126
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.290 
And I was too fast here but not
an activity is following.

127
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.770 
Now we need a
gateway because

128
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.570 
here two things happen in
parallel. On the one hand

129
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.740 
they will calculate
the discount.

130
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.810 
And independent from calculation
or from the discount calculation

131
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.920 
the warehouse can already start with
picking the products from stock.

132
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.480 
As you can see here we have already a line
break so not an automatic line break.

133
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.360 
So it depends
on as long

134
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.590 
the name is we do the line break
here to provide a proper

135
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.590 
naming and also to

136
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.390 
not name the task above the
longer than that actually is.

137
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.930 
So every word will
be

138
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.910 
placed in a new line
if we reach the end of the

139
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.170 
of the activity of the
body of the shape.

140
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:44.250 
Both things happen in parallel that
means we need to change the gateway to

141
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.890 
apparently one so I've chosen the
wrong one but it doesn't

142
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.680 
matter because each element can
be transformed into another one

143
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.360 
another one of the same type. Therefore
I can click on the gateway

144
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.930 
user transform
button below

145
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.300 
and click on please change
it to a parallel one.
And now it’s correct.

146
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.090 
As you can see here if we want to add further
activities we already reached the

147
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:18.140 
and of the pool but even here
doesn't matter because we extend

148
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.580 
the pool automatically

149
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.250 
and at the space which is
needed to model probably.

150
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.720 
Oh wait, create and send.

151
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.820 
The next step would be after
the discount calculation

152
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.550 
we create and send the
invoice to the customer

153
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.250 
and meanwhile in
the warehouse

154
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.600 
they start with
shipping the order.

155
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.520 
After both activities has been well
actually after both parallel

156
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.030 
activities has
been executed

157
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.730 
we can proceed
with the process.

158
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.430 
So let’s merge the two
parallel branches.

159
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.680 
So this gateway waits as long
as is needed to execute

160
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.150 
all activities before we can
proceed with the process.

161
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:19.140 
And what's still missing is we didn't
get any payment from the customer

162
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.390 
this is what we need where
we want to add now

163
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.990 
to complete the process. So
let's see here at this point

164
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.530 
I am adding an
intermediate event.

165
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.730 
And say hey this
is an incoming

166
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.630 
let's say message
incoming money.

167
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.120 
So I would say

168
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.540 
after receiving
the payment

169
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.090 
the process is finished.

170
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.330 


171
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.640 
This shows how easy it is to
model a process and even if we

172
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.770 
want to simply add further
participants or extra participants

173
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.110 
this can also be

174
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.580 
done very simple. Imagine you
want to add some or another

175
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.980 
participant above your existing
process, then we need more space.

176
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.170 
And therefore we have
a feature a helpful feature

177
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.520 
included which is called create space.
And when you click on it

178
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.810 
you get a frame and the
frame allows you to

179
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.180 
yeah create space wherever needed. So
for example you want to add another

180
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.110 
another task between the
gateway and existing ones

181
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.160 
they can simply hold it and move the
entire process to the right side

182
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.320 
maybe more.

183
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.790 
You can see the process is still
the same but we simply have

184
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.630 
more space. That can be used
for everything you need

185
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.140 
to yeah create space where we need
space and it seems you don't

186
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.460 
which needs to be added.

187
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.530 
I could say here I simply want
to add another activity

188
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.470 
if necessary

189
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.330 
and proceed with
the process.

190
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.060 
I can do the same actually to
move the entire process to the

191
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.130 
to the bottom in order to put
another participant above

192
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.670 
the process. For
example here

193
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.180 
I create more space
because I want to

194
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.410 
add another participant the
customer itself to show the

195
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.950 
interaction of message with
messages. So he would say

196
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.630 
it's quite correctly
it is the customer.

197
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:42.110 
And now we can be more precisely we can
a define a where the order comes from

198
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.120 
from the customer but
therefore we have to say

199
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.590 
this is an incoming order an
incoming message event. Therefore

200
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.640 
we need to change the start
of the process start event

201
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.960 
to an incoming message event,
otherwise we can't connect these

202
00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.720 
Both things here. The system
doesn't allow me to connect both

203
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.160 
we need to say
at first that

204
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.070 
it's an incoming message and now we can
define where the order comes from.

205
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.850 
And this is from the customer.

206
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.650 
Even here when we
say the customer

207
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.290 
also sends the payment
we can easily connect

208
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.650 
both those elements

209
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.600 
and to be fair we also send
something to the customer.

210
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.550 
I create a bit more space in
order to say here at this point

211
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.740 
ship order will be or its task will be
shipped the order to the customer.

212
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.040 
And now we can see we have message flows
included now to show the interaction

213
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.630 
between external participants
like the customer and

214
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.220 
also with a task in
our internal process.

215
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.470 
In the end the create space
button can also be used to

216
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.040 
I would say to remove the space which
is not needed anymore. For example

217
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.390 
I want to remove the space here
when this one is zoomed out a bit

218
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.330 
I can also use the zoom
functionality here

219
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.570 
we can see where
we can still

220
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.160 
remove space. For
example here

221
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.810 
to keep the process comprehensible
and yeah we just have

222
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.720 
space which
was really needed.

223
00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.220 
This is quite helpful if other
people want to print out the

224
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.480 
process and there they are
very grateful if the yeah

225
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.990 
if the process model is only
as big as it needs to be.

226
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.950 
Otherwise you have to print
out different pages but in

227
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.880 
the end of the page for example
nothing happens anymore.

228
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.520 
Therefore it is rather recommended to
to remove the space

229
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.460 
which is simply
not needed.

230
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.840 
One more thing I've
talked about

231
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.650 
the attributes bar on there on
the right side which is quite

232
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.030 
important to provide further
information to the process model.

233
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.210 
So for example when you don't click
on any other element

234
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.270 
and you open the attributes bar
you on the diagram level this

235
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.810 
allows you to for example put information
behind the entire diagram like whose

236
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.920 
who the process owner who is
responsible for the entire

237
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.300 
Process, who needs to be a
contacted were informed.

238
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:27.250 
But also here
difference examples but also

239
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.220 
this is the very end where we have
customers action the process. For example

240
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.100 
like this one yes the process
includes index of the customer.

241
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.100 
I can use a checkbox
for example

242
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.100 
but you can also use the attributes
provide an entire documentation

243
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.830 
of the process. What is the process
about? What do I can see here?

244
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.370 
And I want to use the attributes.
For example now for providing

245
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.530 
further information behind the task so I
click on the task have different attributes.

246
00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.470 
Other attributes

247
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.130 
which can be defined
by the administrator

248
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.110 
but they also want some main attributes
coming from BPMN notation

249
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.280 
and this allows me for example
to put a documentation behind

250
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.140 
the task to explain what
needs to be done. I mean

251
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.600 
for now we just say enter order
details but what does it mean

252
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.290 
in practice, what kind of
information do we need to provide?

253
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.960 
These questions can be answered by
using the documentation attribute.

254
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.550 
And you could say
the following

255
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.820 
information are needed.

256
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.200 
You could say
customer name,

257
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.710 
customer address
and so on right.

258
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.960 
customer
ID exists

259
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.500 
and so on. You can even use it
to provide screenshots from a

260
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.810 
system for example to say hey
with this task you need to

261
00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.620 
click on a certain formula system
and to provide certain fields

262
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.250 
the following information.
Sso you can also embed

263
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:05.800 
external screenshots

264
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.300 
but also link to other references
so it's an entire editorial, we can

265
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.260 
put any kind of information to help
other people to understand the process.

266
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.440 
After finishing with
the process

267
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.730 
you can click on the save
button on the upper left corner

268
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.810 
and what you can see here is on
the one hand the process is

269
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.610 
still named as new process so
this is a good opportunity to

270
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:42.880 
change the name,
say order-to-delivery.

271
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.750 
This is the process about
receiving an order

272
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.330 
until the point where
we deliver the order.

273
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.890 
Wei can see in the background we
do a check in the process

274
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.270 
for now contains no
errors but eight hints.

275
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.260 
I want to save it first

276
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.890 
and what would happen if I
delete the name for example

277
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.720 
and save again? Then we can see the
process contains already one arrow.

278
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.320 
And when I want to see what
the system wants me to

279
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.740 
change what to improve then I can
click on the play button here.

280
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.010 
The play button

281
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:28.250 
lists up for shows basically
all all steps for improvement

282
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.620 
where we can be more precisely
or we need to provide further

283
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.450 
information to be compliant with
BPMN and to ensure

284
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.160 
that other people understand
and what needs to be done in the

285
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.320 
Process. And its totally
correct system tells me hey

286
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.850 
the activity needs to be labelled
otherwise the people are not able

287
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.390 
simply doesn't know what
needs to be done here.

288
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.160 
If you get an error message for
example the process you have

289
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.110 
no clue what the system wants to
tell you what the errors are, for

290
00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.600 
example the deadlock multimodes the
several errors which could exist.

291
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.800 
You can always
click on the

292
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.590 
question mark on the right
up right side in the arrow

293
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.970 
which forwards you to the BPMN and modeling
guidelines and the guidelines explain

294
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.560 
with a positive and a negative
example of what's wrong with

295
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.360 
the process or how
it can be improved.

296
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.940 
I mean that case was quite
quite simple, the activity

297
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:29.100 
didn't didn't get a name therefore
it's written activities

298
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.330 
request a name, the activity’s label
should shortly describe the task

299
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.730 
that has to be performed
traceable readable

300
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.950 
and that was
exactly my arrow

301
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.080 
our task had no name,

302
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.070 
or it wasn't named.

303
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.150 
So let's quickly fix it.

304
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.890 
I can refresh the check in the
background now and now the system

305
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.980 
tells me hey everything is fine to get
a green check there are no

306
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.380 
no major errors in the process
but there are still some warnings

307
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.380 
and we have a yeah you
can you can think about

308
00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.900 
a traffic light we have simplified
traffic lights system included.

309
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.580 
Yellow was
always a hint,

310
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.590 
orange is always the warning
and red is always an error. So

311
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.180 
errors should be on
always fixed otherwise

312
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.800 
you run into well you could
have the risk that the process

313
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.980 
is not complete and not
executable with BPMN

314
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.980 
what to the
BPMN notation.

315
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:36.330 
Ok we don't have we
don't have a warning here.

316
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.840 
Ok but warning means hey it would
be good if you can fix it

317
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.810 
but it's not necessary and it's
mandatory and if you're really

318
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.650 
good you provide further information
behind every task as a

319
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:53.180 
hint but it doesn't need to be uh it
doesn't need to be need to be fixed.

320
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:58.140 
It's only if you really want to
to make sure that other people

321
00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.380 
have all information which
are needed to execute the

322
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.140 
process and you can provide
further information.

323
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.990 
Okay lets save again.

324
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.600 
And now when I switch back
to the explorer view

325
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.730 
the system tells me that in the
background the content of the

326
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.360 
folder has been changed if I want
to refresh the view otherwise

327
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.290 
I would have a look at
the deprecated view.

328
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:28.890 
When I refresh the view by
clicking on yes we can see that

329
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.650 
this is our process here has
been created in the background

330
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.630 
and now it exists.

331
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.720 
What can I do with the process
now after it has been created?

332
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.640 
One way would be I want to invite
other colleagues or other

333
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.300 
participants to comment my
diagram to have a look at

334
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.810 
the process and
leave comments.

335
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.690 
Therefore you could click
on the share button

336
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.660 
and the share button includes the
feature to invite anyone for feedback.

337
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.910 
Everything you need
to provide

338
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.340 
to the email address for example
demo@signavio.com.

339
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.100 
You can also leave a message here to
provide a bit more information

340
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.740 
what the other person what you
want the other person to do

341
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.580 
and click on send.

342
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.490 
And the other person the invited
person gets now an email

343
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.860 
including a link
which shows

344
00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.040 
or actually a link which forwards
the person to the process model

345
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.900 
for very certain view.
The person cannot change

346
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.800 
the process model can only
leave comments on each single

347
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.160 
element you have used
in the process model.

348
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.640 
So to summarize what we have
learned in the short lesson.

You have learnt how to access the
Signavio process manager,

350
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.700 
how to create
an account,

351
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.970

structures of the explorer view

352
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.120 
on the left side always the full length

folder you've clicked on.

355
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:14.370 
We have talked about how to use the
editor how to model processes in a very

356
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.840 
efficient way by using the context
menu by using the transform

357
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.400 
button to change
elements.

358
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.580

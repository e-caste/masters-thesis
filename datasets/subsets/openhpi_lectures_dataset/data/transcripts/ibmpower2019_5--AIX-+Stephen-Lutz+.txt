00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.319 
Hello, my name is Stephen Lutz, I am

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.089 
from IBM, from a technical sales

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.619 
team for POWER systems.

4
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.539 
And in this video, I will

5
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.859 
talk a little bit about our

6
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.420 
operating system, AIX.

7
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.089 
So first of all, let me talk a

8
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.487 
little bit about the history of AIX.

9
00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:17.659 
AIX is a Unix

10
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.759 
operating system, and the first

11
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.709 
time Unix was

12
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.689 
mentioned or it was

13
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.690 
developed was in

14
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.829 
1969 in the Bell Labs.

15
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.719 
And as you probably

16
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.648 
know, AIX

17
00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.289 
today is running on our POWER

18
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.239 
systems or in former times it was

19
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.240 
called RS/6000,

20
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.033 
which is based on a RISC

21
00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:40.789 
architecture. Therefore, it's also

22
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
necessary to mention when the RISC

23
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.899 
was developed and it

24
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.900 
was developed in

25
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.999 
1974-75 by IBM

26
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.009 
and well the term AIX

27
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.010 
was

28
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.559 
there in the first time in 1986.

29
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.599 
At that time it was not

30
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.279 
already on a RISC architecture, it

31
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.169 
was in different architectures,

32
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.059 
for example, the S370,

33
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.399 
which is the former mainframe

34
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.379 
environment and

35
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.299 
well in 1998 it was

36
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.859 
the first time they two came

37
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.779 
together, so we had the

38
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.669 
new technology, RS/6000

39
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.679 
was born, and with the operating

40
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.629 
system AIX in that

41
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.964 
time, it was 3.1.

42
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.399 
AIX, by the way, stands for Advanced

43
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.469 
Interactive Executive.

44
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.419 
And what you can also see here

45
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.669 
AIX had several logos

46
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.479 
over the time.

47
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.059 
And yeah, they are just

48
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.590 
shown here on this slide.

49
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.729 
Yeah, well, what's to explain

50
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.659 
about AIX?

51
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.339 
First of all, I thought let's talk a

52
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.899 
little bit about the graphical user

53
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.819 
interface. Well, yes, also AIX

54
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.069 
has a graphical user interface.

55
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.959 
It has also several of

56
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.479 
them. You can also run KDE,

57
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.369 
for example, on top of

58
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.379 
an AIX system, but a standard one

59
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.509 
is the CDE, what you can see

60
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.859 
here on this slide.

61
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.779 
This was often used

62
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.119 
in former times because RS/6000

63
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.970 
was also the platform for doing CAD,

64
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.819 
so Computer Aided Design

65
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.009 
with the RS/6000 systems.

66
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.899 
This was often used, for example, in

67
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.459 
the automotive industry

68
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.819 
where all the models are developed

69
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.529 
on these systems by using the

70
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.719 
software called CATIA, for example,

71
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.119 
which is only one of the

72
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.320 
CAD software running on POWER.

73
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.699 
Well, perhaps the most important

74
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.559 
tool inside AIX is

75
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.449 
a so-called SMIT (Systems

76
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.489 
Management Interface Tool).

77
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.979 
This is a memory environment.

78
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.799 
This is a systems management

79
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.659 
tool, as you can see,

80
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.849 
in the form of a menu

81
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.719 
environment.

82
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.399 
So if you need to do something

83
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.319 
inside the operating system, for

84
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.509 
example, creating a logical volume

85
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.339 
or creating a file system, and

86
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.719 
if you don't know how to do that,

87
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.089 
then enter the SMIT and just

88
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.589 
look forward to seeing that you want

89
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.839 
to do and you will find

90
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.759 
it and easily can execute it

91
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.599 
on your AIX

92
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600 
system.

93
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.180 
Something that is quite nice in the

94
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.929 
SMIT tool, if you, for

95
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.399 
example, want to add a logical

96
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.769 
volume as shown here on this slide,

97
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.389 
if you also want to know what is the

98
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.819 
command behind that menu,

99
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.219 
you always can press the F6

100
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.129 
button and then you get the command

101
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.019 
that is used underneath the menu

102
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.889 
structure.

103
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.899 
So in this case, it's an

104
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.299 
"mklv" command, for example.

105
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.919 
And with that, you can learn how the

106
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.920 
command

107
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.399 
looks like. And you can use this

108
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.929 
knowledge then for doing, for

109
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.930 
example, scripts.

110
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.889 
Yeah, AIX has

111
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.939 
always a logical value manager

112
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.759 
is it's not as in Linux that you can

113
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.599 
decide if you want to use it, if you

114
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.689 
or if you don't want to use it,

115
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.169 
AIX always has a logical volume

116
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.899 
manager per default.

117
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.029 
And it uses a general file system

118
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.030 
which is called jfs2.

119
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.979 
What you can see here on this file

120
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.059 
are two commands.

121
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.739 
First of all, you can show with the

122
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.839 
lspv command, what disks

123
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.789 
are inside your AIX operating system

124
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.439 
in this case, three of them.

125
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.268 
You can see two are used in

126
00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.398 
a volume group called rootvg.

127
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.219 
This is the operating system

128
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.209 
volume group.

129
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.129 
And the third

130
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.259 
disk is used in a separate vg

131
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.749 
called exportvg, in this case.

132
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.639 
Underneath, you can see some details

133
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.919 
about Root Volume Group.

134
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.749 
You see that the operating

135
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.909 
system is divided in several

136
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.910 
parts,

137
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.128 
in hd

138
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.619 
logical volume.

139
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.179 
So that's one for the root file

140
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.709 
system. There's one for temp file

141
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.790 
system, one for

142
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.209 
var, one for opt and some others.

143
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.039 
And what you also can see is to

144
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.079 
construct how mirroring

145
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.819 
works in AIX.

146
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.799 
You see here that

147
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.889 
each logical volume has a certain

148
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.079 
number of logical partitions,

149
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.969 
LPs and but you also

150
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.889 
can see in the diagram that logical

151
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.929 
LPs are assigned

152
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.930 
to physical

153
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.180 
partitions

154
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.969 
PPs inside a disk.

155
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.949 
So every disk is divided into

156
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.169 
a certain number of PPs,

157
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.509 
depending on the

158
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.399 
size of the disk and depending on

159
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.799 
the size of the partition

160
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.879 
that you want to create or the

161
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.589 
partition size.

162
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.779 
So in this case, you can see that

163
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.760 
in the root volume group that we

164
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.089 
have here, in this example,

165
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.919 
you see that, for example, the first

166
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.959 
line there is one LP

167
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.909 
used, one logical

168
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.679 
partition, and this is assigned to

169
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.659 
two physical partitions.

170
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.849 
And the two physical partitions

171
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.099 
are lying on two PPs.

172
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.959 
That means we have a mirroring.

173
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.149 
So one logical partition to two

174
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.959 
physical ones.

175
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.939 
And these two physicals are on

176
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.499 
two separated disks.

177
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.449 
And with that, you know, you have

178
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.849 
a mirroring here in place.

179
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.979 
So this is something that was in AIX

180
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.029 
from the first time

181
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.699 
or is it a journalling was there on

182
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.809 
the first time. This was an

183
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.519 
important feature, especially in the

184
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.259 
beginning, because in the beginning

185
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.779 
often filesystem had no journalling

186
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.729 
and when the system crashed then

187
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.199 
this often crashed also the file

188
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.019 
system, which was not the case with

189
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.474 
AIX because AIX

190
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.009 
had this journal file system

191
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.010 
at that time.

192
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.829 
Yeah, let's talk a little bit about

193
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.235 
workload partitions.

194
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.679 
AIX has container technology inside,

195
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.049 
and it is inside AIX already

196
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.479 
since 2008.

197
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.519 
So today we would say these

198
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.199 
are containers like docker

199
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.179 
containers, similar

200
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.019 
concept.

201
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.419 
So that means you can

202
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.699 
have one operating system, one AIX,

203
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.739 
and inside of this operating system,

204
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.019 
you can run different containers

205
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.849 
that are somehow separated from

206
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.979 
the big operating system

207
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.969 
around it.

208
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.099 
So you can have two

209
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.289 
types of virtual partitions.

210
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.310 
One is a system virtual

211
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:14.339 
partition. This is like a virtual

212
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.199 
machine. That means you can have

213
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.389 
a separated IP address inside

214
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.390 
a system

215
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.099 
WPAR and you

216
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.439 
can also have a separate security

217
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.539 
domain inside that WPAR.

218
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.639 
That means the root user inside

219
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.499 
a WPAR could be different from

220
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.839 
the root user outside.

221
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.059 
So from the operating system around

222
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.059 
and you have a second type of WPAR.

223
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.789 
This is an application WPAR.

224
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.859 
This means you simply put one

225
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.019 
application into a special

226
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.219 
environment.

227
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.689 
And why would you do that?

228
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.269 
You could do that, for example,

229
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.459 
because of resource control.

230
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.499 
That means you can assign

231
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.899 
a certain amount of

232
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.029 
resources to a virtual partition.

233
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.779 
For example, you can say that the

234
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.059 
partition will be here in the

235
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.069 
example will only get

236
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.019 
20 percent of the

237
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.109 
processor resources and let's say

238
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.479 
25 percent of the memory resources.

239
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.759 
And then, yeah, you have enough

240
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.739 
for the others to work

241
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.740 
with.

242
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.009 
Yeah, this is something that is

243
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.010 
quite new in AIX.

244
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.749 
You probably heard

245
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.549 
already about docker containers,

246
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.529 
which is a very interesting

247
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.849 
topic and is

248
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.058 
many times discussed nowadays.

249
00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.678 
And for these docker containers

250
00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.298 
running on a Linux environment, you

251
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.668 
often also have some management

252
00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.673 
environments like Kubernetes.

253
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.379 
And what we have with AIX,

254
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.409 
we can now also integrate

255
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.019 
containers for AIX inside

256
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.579 
Kubernetes environment.

257
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.379 
So that means if you have a

258
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.269 
repository, then you can have

259
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.609 
that also not only

260
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.199 
docker containers for Linux, but

261
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.089 
also containers for an AIX

262
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.109 
environment.

263
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.729 
And if you use these containers,

264
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.699 
then we will use the underlying

265
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.439 
WPAR technology for that to make

266
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440 
them run.

267
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.639 
Another nice technology that

268
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.189 
is used by most of our

269
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.189 
AIX customers is the so-called

270
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.259 
NIM installation manager, our short

271
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.260 
term is

272
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.249 
NIM. With a name server, you can

273
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.139 
manage your environment

274
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.629 
containing a lot of

275
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.039 
virtual machines or physical

276
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.149 
machines.

277
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.039 
That means you can install

278
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.176 
these clients, this NIM

279
00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:39.399 
clients from an

280
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.549 
installation source that

281
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.409 
is most of the time a so-called

282
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.449 
LPP source, which is nothing

283
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.759 
else an ISO image from the

284
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.739 
installation DVD, for

285
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.740 
example.

286
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.009 
But what you also can do, you can

287
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.899 
take backups of your clients.

288
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.970 
That means you can take a full

289
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.749 
operating system back up into one

290
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.849 
file. That is now then stored

291
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.989 
on the NIM server.

292
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.779 
So that means if the client is

293
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.699 
crashed for whatever reason,

294
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.099 
then you can simply restore this

295
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.959 
MKSYSBs, as we call it, the image

296
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.269 
file and you have the exact

297
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.099 
same operating system with all the

298
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.869 
files, with everything in place

299
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.399 
after the restore.

300
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.589 
So this is quite a nice feature,

301
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.940 
which comes

302
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.848 
in a standard AIX environment.

303
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.659 
Yeah, another file, it's like you

304
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.009 
can see here, like a Swiss Army

305
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.619 
knife, so multi-function

306
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.724 
management tool for AIX.

307
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.609 
It's also often used to do

308
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.869 
cloning of systems.

309
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.179 
So many customers create a

310
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.369 
so-called golden image with

311
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.919 
AIX inside, with some tools inside.

312
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.779 
And if your

313
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.669 
customer needs another instance

314
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.769 
of AIX, he simply

315
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.169 
takes that image and

316
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.849 
deploys the image in a virtual

317
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.139 
machine or in a client.

318
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.449 
Yeah, let's talk a little bit about

319
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.419 
some brand new features of

320
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.319 
AIX, so what you see here is

321
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320 
a feature that is

322
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.519 
available in AIX 7.2 the latest

323
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.499 
version of our operating system,

324
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.139 
and it's called AIX Live Update.

325
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.089 
So the idea here is

326
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.179 
to install AIX

327
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.370 
updates without

328
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.059 
a restart of the operating

329
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.799 
system and also without restart of

330
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.179 
the application.

331
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.129 
So in this case, what

332
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.130 
you do,

333
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.829 
you take a separate disk

334
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.959 
and this disk, your mirror, the root

335
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.339 
volume groups or the operating

336
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.259 
system, then do the operating

337
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.119 
system update on this

338
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.709 
second disk.

339
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.749 
After that, you move this disk

340
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.759 
to a new virtual machine,

341
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.559 
to an additional virtual machine, a

342
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.832 
so-called surrogate LPAR.

343
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.699 
And then afterwards,

344
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.739 
you use life partition mobility

345
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.869 
technologies to move

346
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.819 
the memory content of the running

347
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.709 
application and also the running

348
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.569 
application, of course, to the

349
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.099 
second system, to the surrogate

350
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:12.969 
LPAR.

351
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.919 
And when you moved all the memory

352
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.629 
contents, then you can switch over

353
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.249 
to the surrogate LPAR and a

354
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.049 
surrogate LPAR, of course, once on

355
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.149 
the new migrated

356
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.189 
version of AIX of the new

357
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.289 
AIX version, that includes all the

358
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.699 
patches.

359
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.469 
And after that, you can simply

360
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.259 
delete the original

361
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.519 
LPAR and make the surrogate LPAR the

362
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.409 
new original or the new primary

363
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.410 
one.

364
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.229 
This is, as I said, a brand new

365
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.099 
technology.

366
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.019 
It started with some smaller fixes,

367
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.789 
but nowadays it's also possible to

368
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.709 
install whole technology levels

369
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.929 
to a big pack of fixes

370
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.029 
into the system without needing

371
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.400 
a reboot for the application.

372
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.819 
OK, let's talk a little bit about

373
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.669 
the latest enhancements of AIX,

374
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.619 
first of all, we have new

375
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.539 
scalability limits.

376
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.509 
That means we can have now

377
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.359 
1536 threads inside a single

378
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.249 
LPAR and also 32

379
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.139 
terabytes of memory.

380
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.449 
So that means almost

381
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.179 
a whole high-end system in one

382
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.469 
partition with AIX as the operating

383
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.470 
system.

384
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.919 
Then what's very important

385
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.749 
inside AIX is the

386
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.799 
security part.

387
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.109 
And what we have now in

388
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.110 
the AIX the whole way

389
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.829 
from installing an AIX or

390
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.689 
running an AIX is now secured with

391
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.709 
checksums.

392
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.029 
That means when you install an

393
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.039 
operating system during

394
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.479 
installation, you can check the

395
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.309 
checksum and see if

396
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.499 
the image that you are installing

397
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.149 
is trusted.

398
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.769 
Also, when you start a virtual

399
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.869 
machine and install virtual machine

400
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.729 
at a time when the firmware

401
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.529 
passes the control over to the

402
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.629 
operating system, then the firmware

403
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.489 
also can take some checksums and

404
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.559 
see if the operating system

405
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.359 
that is installed is trusted and not

406
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.360 
modified.

407
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.559 
Then, as always, we have support for

408
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.139 
new hardware technologies

409
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.390 
like POWER9, NVMe.

410
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.629 
NVMe is a flash-based high-performance

411
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.489 
storage.

412
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.279 
And we have also support for new

413
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.600 
Ethernet adapter such as the 100

414
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.790 
GB/s adapter.

415
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.750 
Then we

416
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.039 
have some new disks

417
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.241 
that we can use in the multipath

418
00:14:26.242 --> 00:14:28.059 
frameworks. These disks,

419
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.060 
iSCSI discs.

420
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.629 
iSCSI is often used by cloud service

421
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.909 
providers and that's why we included

422
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.649 
also iSCSI technology in the

423
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.650 
multipath framework.

424
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.679 
That means you can use the same

425
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.359 
commands as you do with a fiber

426
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.669 
channel environment also

427
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.169 
for iSCSI disks.

428
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.170 
Yeah, the last

429
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.849 
point here is talking about

430
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.850 
JFS2 file space reclaim.

431
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.019 
When you assign a disk from

432
00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.089 
your storage to a virtual machine

433
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.559 
or one AIX instance,

434
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.679 
you can, for example, say, I want to

435
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.049 
assign 20 gigabytes of storage,

436
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.029 
but these 20 gigabytes are often

437
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.709 
not used by the operating system,

438
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.629 
but perhaps only, let's say, two

439
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.549 
gigabytes of

440
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.569 
the storage.

441
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.429 
And as a storage system

442
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.430 
works with

443
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:04.850 
space-efficient technology, that means only these two gigabytes that are

444
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:04.864 
really there needs to be stored, are really stored to the disks in the

445
00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:04.874 
storage subsystem. And with that technology, you are able to

446
00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:04.885 
over-provision your storage. That means you can assign more storage than

447
00:16:04.886 --> 00:16:04.897 
you have inside your storage subsystem. Yeah, and as a storage grows

448
00:16:04.898 --> 00:16:04.909 
inside the operating system or not only grows, there's also some times

449
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.924 
that parts of it will be deleted. So some blocks will be deleted. And the

450
00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:04.936 
operating system knows, of course, about these deleted blocks, but it in

451
00:16:04.937 --> 00:16:04.947 
former times, it couldn't pass this information to the storage subsystem.

452
00:16:04.948 --> 00:16:04.961 
So the storage subsystems did not know that there was a block that is

453
00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:05.349 
that was deleted. And now with this functionality, AIX can tell the space

454
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.269 
is free to the

455
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.099 
storage subsystem and so the storage

456
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.109 
subsystem can use this space again

457
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.299 
for some other virtual machines

458
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.300 
if necessary.

459
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.169 
Yeah, AIX road map,

460
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.059 
we have a clear road map that is

461
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.060 
going

462
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.349 
very wide in the future.

463
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.952 
As you can see here, we have now AIX

464
00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:30.009 
7.2 as our current

465
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.409 
operating systems system.

466
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.599 
We will get, of course, some

467
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.909 
further technology levels

468
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.779 
in the future.

469
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.609 
Often it's one technology level

470
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.599 
per year.

471
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.249 
So this means with this technology

472
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.229 
levels, we get some new

473
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.689 
functionalities inside

474
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.369 
AIX. Before technology levels, we

475
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.349 
also often get service

476
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.879 
packs. With this, we

477
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.329 
get some fixes inside the operating

478
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.199 
system.

479
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.389 
Yeah, in the next release, so AIX

480
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.759 
next so to say, will

481
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.589 
perhaps will be available in

482
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.179 
the year 2020.

483
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.189 
But as stated below, this is a plan

484
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.779 
and plans, of course,could change,

485
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.389 
but at least is the roadmap

486
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.098 
as we are seeing how we will do it

487
00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.099 
in the future.

488
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.669 
OK, where is AIX

489
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.670 
use today?

490
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.689 
AIX is often used in SAP

491
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.879 
environments or in classical

492
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.189 
SAP environment, of course not in a

493
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.929 
HANA system because HANA relies on

494
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.699 
Linux technology.

495
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.199 
But of course, HANA is also

496
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.129 
available on POWER.

497
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.229 
But with Linux, the operating system

498
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.230 
underneath

499
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.999 
AIX is often used with databases

500
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.979 
such as DB2

501
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.980 
or Oracle.

502
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.419 
AIX is also often used

503
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.549 
in a WebSphere environment.

504
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.439 
It is quite typical and also

505
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.539 
some analytics applications

506
00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.579 
like Cognos or SPSS

507
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.439 
and there are also some more

508
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.999 
applications, of course, that can

509
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.639 
run in the AIX environment.

510
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.799 
Yeah, AIX is still a very popular

511
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.779 
operating system as it is very, very

512
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.729 
stable and tuned for POWER

513
00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:07.899 
systems, of course.

514
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.729 
And yeah, administrators

515
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.649 
like it because it's

516
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.569 
if you know how to do it, it's

517
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.909 
very simple to administer operating

518
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.379 
system.

519
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.819 
If you know Linux, then it's not

520
00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.829 
hard to learn AIX because many

521
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.719 
commands simply will work in

522
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.859 
AIX.

523
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.929 
And as I told you in the beginning,

524
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.669 
you have two systems management

525
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.544 
interface, the SMIT

526
00:18:29.545 --> 00:18:31.629 
and your last bullet here AIX

527
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.729 
people are wanted in the industry.

528
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.979 
So if you have AIX knowledge,

529
00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.509 
then you can also earn a lot of

530
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.819 
money in the industry

531
00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.820 
because as said, people

532
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.869 
are rare and

533
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.870 
wanted.

534
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.959 
OK, that's basically all I have

535
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.209 
about AIX and, yeah,

536
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.109 
stay tuned.

537
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.110 
Thank you.

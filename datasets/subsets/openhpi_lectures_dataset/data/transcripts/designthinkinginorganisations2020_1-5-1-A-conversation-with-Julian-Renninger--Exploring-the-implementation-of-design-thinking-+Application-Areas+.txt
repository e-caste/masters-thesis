00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.930 
Welcome to our openHPI course on
mastering design thinking in organizations.

2
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.590 
I'm Danielly and the topic
of today is application areas.

3
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.460 
And for that we have invited
Julian from SBB to share some of

4
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.640 
his learning with us. Julian can you
please introduce yourself?

5
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.680 
Hello, my name is Julian Renninger.
I'm working at SBB as a product

6
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.230 
owner and innovation manager and in the last
year we worked on some innovative

7
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.580 
products where we implemented or
not implemented design-thinking. I'm

8
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.320 
happy to share my thoughts and
experience with it with you.

9
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.950 
Thank you very much. So let's
start with an easy question.

10
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.020 
What is your understanding
of what design thinking is?

11
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.670 
Design thinking for me

12
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.460 
are two things. One is the mindset,
innovative mindset on how

13
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.650 
to approach problems or how to
create challenges, and the other

14
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.380 
one is a toolbox, the different
methods of how to get to your

15
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
innovation, to your product in a
structured way. I think it's very important

16
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.440 
in my view to differentiate between
this mindset and toolbox to know

17
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.740 
where you're lacking of
what you should be doing.

18
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.040 
And considering that you believe
that design thinking can be a toolbox,

19
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.210 
could be a mindset,
in which context

20
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.390 
do you see design thinking be used, let's
say as a toolbox, what are the context where

21
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.150 
it can be applied or the mindset, what are
the context that design thinking can be applied?

22
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.920 
Daily I often asked
myself if this is not something

23
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.260 
I can use design
thinking with

24
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
and I often noticed I can use
design thinking like always if I

25
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.710 
have a clear
challenge and a question.

26
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.140 
We often fail of using
design thinking or somehow

27
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.640 
getting this method into an
active manner, an active way

28
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.360 
because we are missing this
challenge this question of what

29
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.660 
is our problem, what do we want
to solve and I think in a moment

30
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.750 
you have a wicked question, in a
moment you have something like

31
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.290 
I want to solve this, I want to do something
there. Then design thinking already works

32
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.850 
and it doesn't matter so much what it is
about your area. You just need to have this question.

33
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.690 
And how is it to find this question? Where
is this question coming from normally?

34
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.060 
Yeah this is something I feel at
least my company and what I hear

35
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.120 
from other companies too,
are really struggling.

36
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.860 
We don't take the time to
find this question and I think

37
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.200 
it is one of the key phases
of the whole process

38
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.520 
and how do we come to the question?
Often after feeling when we

39
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.440 
when we formulate this question
or start formulating this question

40
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.530 
we have the idea how to solve
the problem in our hand

41
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.310 
and how to get there also. So we
actually, we are not open for

42
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.070 
it. We already know, in my
case for example, we would like

43
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.640 
to change the mobility of the
future, but we know for this

44
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.600 
we need an app and for this the
mobility needs to be interconnected.

45
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
So we build an interconnected app.
Done. So let's use design-thinking.

46
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.650 
No, but the question was much before.
Like what is the problem, yada yada.

47
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.260 
So the question was how do we
get to the question

48
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.590 
and the answer would be,

49
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.420 
be still, take your time, don't make
assumptions and really ask yourself

50
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.230 
deep down what bothers you, what
is the problem. Not that you'll have a solution

51
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.490 
in your head after five seconds.
What do you think in the night

52
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.280 
when you turn on your bed, bugging
and you can't get forward.

53
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.370 
This is
the question you want to look for.

54
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.160 
And I think often
we don't do that.

55
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.470 
Maybe because we are
scared, or, I don't know.

56
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.890 
Do you think design thinking
can help us to get this, to

57
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.080 
find this question?
Yes.

58
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.220 
I think, if we would accept that finding
the question is already a problem

59
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.540 
that could be solved with
design thinking, then definitely yes.

60
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.610 
I think often we
have the feeling

61
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.130 
that we have to have it
before we can start it.

62
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.300 
But this may be more to
the mindset area then

63
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.600 
if you have the mindset of design thinking, like
everything is like design-thinking,

64
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.710 
and everything is trying
to iterative,

65
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.930 
working to emphasize sand
downsizing phases. So, yes.

66
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.190 
Alright and coming back
to the company where you work,

67
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.030 
could you please share some
learnings related from

68
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.000 
your experience implementing design
thinking, maybe some successful,

69
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.000 
maybe some learning from successful
project, maybe some learning

70
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.280 
from not so successful
projects. Broad question.

71
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.790 
Let's not get to a
too broad answer.

72
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.680 
First the successful.

73
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.280 
I think we were very successful
in using design thinking when we

74
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.620 
only looked at the tools. When we only
took small tools as a part

75
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.780 
of our process and then really
implemented taht. When we explain

76
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.080 
to people this is part of design
thinking, this is a tool we

77
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.400 
can use, we use it now for a week. Then we
were really successful in implementing it.

78
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.700 
However I think this is not what design
thinking is about. I think

79
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.910 
design thinking is a broader
approach or a wider approach.

80
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.620 
Though I have to say we were rather
often not successful or unsuccessful

81
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.360 
and the reasons why we were not successful,
I think I can name three reasons.

82
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.140 
The first reason is already named
it but we rarely had a clear

83
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.690 
channel clear question. We just started
a project and we were working around

84
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.360 
panicky for design
innovation tools.

85
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.700 
The second reason is, I think,
design thinking needs time.

86
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.690 
I think it needs focus and time. If
you don't have a buy-in from

87
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.880 
a sea level from a high level
in the management you can get

88
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.360 
it to get this time. I was so
frustrated often to hear like,

89
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.770 
yeah we do design-thinking but we now
stretch it to a one week sprint.

90
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.240 
And then we were successful. Like no,
that's not successful. It is just

91
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.410 
torturing a process or torturing
tools. I think to really be

92
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.210 
successful in design thinking
you have to really have someone who

93
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.500 
protects you and gives
you the time.

94
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.190 
And this leads me for the third point. I
think to really implement design thinking,

95
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.880 
you have to be some kind of
capsulated or isolated,

96
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.440 
to be freed from all
the other pressures.

97
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.810 
Not that you are the paradise bird
who has never been integrated

98
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.030 
back into the company but that
you really get your safe space,

99
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.260 
where you can run around because I
often have the feeling that design thinking is

100
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.000 
still connected to a lot of risk and
many companies and many managers

101
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.170 
are not willing to
take the risk.

102
00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.840 
So to sum it up again I think we
fail often because we didn't

103
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.710 
have a clear challenge, because we
didn't have sea level buy-in

104
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.490 
and we didn't have our
secure area where we could play.

105
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.860 
I never could give
a suggestion. Maybe

106
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.540 
really take your time
find the right question,

107
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.010 
and get support at the sea level
and to get suport at the sea level

108
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.380 
I think it's a lot
about the mindset.

109
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.950 
I often feel that the sea level says
yeah we like innovation

110
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.910 
but they don't like to take risks. And this
doesn't work together. You have

111
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.270 
to take the risk; you don't get
innovation without the risk.

112
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.850 
So you have to really not make
risk management, you have to

113
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.060 
make risk awareness or

114
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.870 
you have to really find someone
who's risk willing, risk seeking

115
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.230 
to be successful. How do you,
so, you learned a lot

116
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.140 
by implementing design thinking, by
going through all these challenges

117
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.960 
and then by improving the way that
you and your team do it.

118
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:04.140 
But how did you actually get
that to have this click of,

119
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.910 
okay, this is what we need to change,
that is what we're doing

120
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.700 
bad, this is what we need to change,
so let's do it. How was the process

121
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.950 
to get this insight?

122
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.870 
I think the design thinking tools
help you to facilitate to

123
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.580 
get to this moment but in the end
of the day it's mindset and

124
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:26.550 
to be really like blunt, I would say we
didn't do it, but in the spirit of, yeah

125
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.220 
you sit there, you stand at the roof
of your building, you're

126
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.400 
frustrated, you have a bee on your hand and
then you suddenly know what to do

127
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.660 
because you discussed about
it. I think it's this,

128
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.680 
I think, for me personally for
myself great in design

129
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.900 
thinking is that it
gives me a structure

130
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.950 
where a can with a creative
mind like totally let

131
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.010 
myself go and and follow my
streams of ideas and structures

132
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.200 
but know that there are some
kind of tools accompanying me

133
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.490 
and putting myself to borders
and knowing my direction, like

134
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.370 
don#t go too much there
and then it's just

135
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.960 
for us often the moment of click came
either when we were super emotional

136
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.680 
and fought with each other. We were
super

137
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.810 
honest to each other. So we managed to
get a safe space. The second click was

138
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.060 
outside and we really

139
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.590 
tested our product, we talked to the people
and we were not sitting on office.

140
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.750 
I think the moment we left our offices,
the moment we left our chairs,

141
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.950 
the postits, the moment we ran outside, we talked to
people in the street, to our friends.

142
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.890 
Doesn't matter, we did something
totally is then it clicked,

143
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.270 
then we thought, we should do that.
This is our work, this is the

144
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.880 
reason, this is how
we should structure this slide.

145
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.600 
This is the tool to do it. But then
comes the hard part because

146
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.400 
you really have to think it
through and do it.

147
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.330 
Interesting. So then what I am
understanding from you is that for you to

148
00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:01.460 
understand how to improve your skills, it
was necessary to create this safe space

149
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.260 
where the things could opened up
and also to expand your references

150
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.930 
in terms of going outside
and talking with people and

151
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.710 
see what else could be done,
what else is out there

152
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:20.450 
and not just stay inside in a team
trying to figure out what's happening.

153
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.840 
Yes definitely. I think you summarized
it much better than I did.

154
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.160 
I mean it's such a cheap sentence
and you hear it so often

155
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.740 
you really have to get
out of the comfort zone

156
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.970 
and then at the moment works and
a comfort zone means inside

157
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.970 
a team, like really being
honest with each other

158
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.440 
and being outside

159
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.750 
and addressing the problems
there. I think Falk Uebernickel once

160
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.900 
said a sentence, not true
if it was him, I think it was him,

161
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.020 
that the Amazon
boss said

162
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.770 
that if the innovation doesn't
hurt it's not radical enough.

163
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.680 
It's not the real innovation and
I think I heard this often

164
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.660 
in the meetings. If a situation, if a
solution felt too soft, no one opposed it,

165
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.570 
it was just a cheap
lame compromise.

166
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.890 
If it didn't provoke any reaction
then it wasn't the right idea.

167
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.920 
At one point, everything started having
emotions and fighting about it.

168
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.570 
Then I knew okay, now we are in the right
track, now something is happening.

169
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.060 
Now with triggering the real problems
or the real superstitions

170
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.300 
and we then have a safe space and
then have the right tools like

171
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.840 
trigger this moment
then we can win.

172
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.540 
Interesting. Many people are actually
trying to avoid conflict at all costs.

173
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.400 
Many people see conflict
as a negative sign

174
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.050 
and that this should never happen
in the team. But what you

175
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.780 
are telling me it's actually this
disagreement among the team members,

176
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.050 
it can be an indication that
there is something there.

177
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:02.200 
Right? Yes, I think this
was my reference before creating

178
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.660 
interdisciplinary organized
teams. I think there lies the secret.

179
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.930 
I think if you put in a team
someone from the core business,

180
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.490 
twenty years into the topic
some new some kind of

181
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.860 
paradise bird innovator and someone
in the middle who mediates

182
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.250 
a little bit, then there will be
a lot of conflict in the team

183
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.960 
but the result will be that they
really manage to combine

184
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.570 
the old and the new world and come
to a conclusion and I think

185
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.940 
we should actually pay as a company
is this process of them fighting

186
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.860 
and finding a new way and you help
them in the team by processing

187
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.760 
it and keeping it a bit in nice
borders. Actually it's just

188
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.570 
about these different views and
different mindsets just clash and

189
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.500 
yes they have to fight.

190
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.980 
And yes, I think everyone is
against this fight it's negative

191
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.280 
and it should never be personal but
professional but sometimes they're thinking

192
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.000 
we're trying to find something new,
we need to break some glasses.

193
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.670 
It's okay, that's getting
personal at a certain level

194
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.580 
some certain threshold. I
mean, it should never get personal

195
00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.570 
personal but on this

196
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.710 
on this thing
that you like

197
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.680 
pissed by the other one if you can't
understand his ideas it's

198
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.250 
a good process. If you
start asking why.

199
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.160 
Having a mediator is always important.
Or someone who can negotiate.

200
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.950 
There is something that just came to
my mind is that when we talk

201
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:26.270 
about design thinking, we talk a lot about
ambiguity, we talk a lot about uncertainty,

202
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.980 
that you have to get used to navigate
in a world of ambiguity and uncertainty.

203
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:38.530 
Do you think that that's the
reason why there is this

204
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.200 
let's say disagreement, this
conflict within the team?

205
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.730 
Do you see connection? Definitely.
I think this ambiguity and

206
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.660 
uncertainty put yourselves it
exposes yourself a lot. I think

207
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.670 
if you don't have a safe place or a
team you can trust, it makes yourself unsecure

208
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.180 
that you either have a huge conflict
or you compromise it.

209
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:10.680 
I often feel that everyone is
saying ambiguity is important

210
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.000 
uncertainty but it's
just an empty word.

211
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.740 
I think we say but we don't
feelit, that we don't mean

212
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.160 
it because with we're scared. I
notice it a lot. I think my company's

213
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.800 
absolutely not willing to accept
ambiguity and uncertainty.

214
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.250 
I so often hear sentences
like yeah but

215
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.100 
ok I give you another two months but
then I have to have a sure solution.

216
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.270 
But no I can't give you a solution,
that's the point about it but

217
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.110 
then it has to work. No it can't
work, then I can't say you now

218
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.050 
that it works but the whole
process of finding out. But then

219
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.170 
I don't want to
listen to you.

220
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.580 
But if you don't do
you also bet. I mean

221
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.150 
this ambiguity is
I think a huge

222
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.430 
problem and I think this is
what I mean with the mindset.

223
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.690 
I'm not sure how to get someone that
he is able to deal with dignity,

224
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.550 
if not he learned it or
experienced it in a positive way.

225
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.200 
For me the
tools, that is,

226
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.820 
if I would have a wish on a
design taking training I think

227
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.430 
I would emphasise less the toolset,
I think this you can

228
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.520 
do with webinars and alone in
reading books, I would emphasise

229
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.230 
on this mindset, this ambiguity,
on the team building stuff

230
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.630 
because there it
actually fails.

231
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.410 
We're very good just reading
slides and following a tool book.

232
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.250 
I mean, we can all do
safe works and

233
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.120 
project management tests.
You know what I mean.

234
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.020 
Besides ambiguity and uncertainty
what are the other elements

235
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.870 
that you associate with
a design thinking mindset?

236
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.610 
I think being brave.

237
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:50.280 
I think we need to be brave to yourself
to really jump into your own shadow

238
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:56.350 
and being brave to speak out and
fight against the existing ideas.

239
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.040 
Another one is sure
creativity and the normal thing.

240
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.850 
The third one or the fifth one
I would say being humbled.

241
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.160 
I have the feeling often including
myself and feeling

242
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.440 
of some kind of

243
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.550 
I am in the wait, I can do something.
I think design thinking is

244
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.150 
much more worth
listening to people,

245
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.400 
listening to the situation, having
a feeling, looking. It's all about looking.

246
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.270 
So I think one of the things that
I'd say is observing and be humble.

247
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.710 
And I think then you'll
be successful.

248
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.470 
Humble, observing,
ambiguity, uncertainty.

249
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.430 
Interesting you didn't
mention user centered.

250
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.740 
Was that on purpose? No, but I think
this was for me in being humble,

251
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.720 
because user-centered is what
else? I don't know.

252
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.410 
User centered is such an empty
word already with everyone

253
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.030 
using it, I think every single
framework is using user-centered

254
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.370 
and if you look at cities
everyone is user-centered.

255
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.060 
And we know that's not
true. We know that

256
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.190 
there are differences. I don't
understand what the difference are

257
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.730 
yet. For me it still is being humble,
being this able to observe,

258
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.100 
being able to listen to other
people. Then you are user centric.

259
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.280 
If you think you're the best, you've the best
solution, then you aren't user centric.

260
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.350 
Now we are approaching the
end of our conversation.

261
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.720 
My last question to you would be
what is your advice to companies

262
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:45.320 
that are starting to implement design thinking,
that want to start implementing design thinking,

263
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.000 
but they don't know from where
to start, they don't know how

264
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.650 
design thinking can be applicable to the
company, what would be your advice?

265
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.480 
My advice would be,

266
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.350 
are you still there?
Yes.

267
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.090 
Okay, because your picture froze but if you
can hear me everything is fine.

268
00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.440 
Sorry. So again my
advice would be

269
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.940 
don't understand design
thinking just as a tool, don't

270
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.110 
get a design thinking specialist and
then take the design thinking

271
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.850 
hammer and hammer it on everything.
I think this is going to fail.

272
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.630 
I think what needs
to happen is

273
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.860 
that you understand the
mindset and what it needs

274
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.940 
to innovate with a
tool like design thinking

275
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.690 
and then really take the time for yourself
like at the beginning of our conversation

276
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.100 
to think what is the question?
What is the problem to solve?

277
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.780 
Ask this yourself first.

278
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.400 
What you need to do, where
you have the biggest challenges,

279
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.400 
where you don't find a solution.
If there's simple solutions

280
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.930 
anywhere don't use design thinking.
Use it when you really have a problem

281
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.540 
and then start just setting
up a small and heterogeneous

282
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.300 
team and just start.
Just start doing it.

283
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.150 
And I think this is the right way
to do.Accept the problem first,

284
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.340 
get that mindset and
then look for the tool.

285
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.320 
Don't start with
the tool, please.

286
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.820 
So focus on the
mindset.

287
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.280 
Very good.
And the challenge.

288
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.950 
And the challenge; we cannot
forget the challenge.

289
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.910 
Julian, thank you so much for
talking with me about this topic,

290
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.410 
I really
appreciate that.

291
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.500 
Thank you very much.

292
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.730 
Thank you also to
our audience

293
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.860 
who is now
listening to us

294
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.570 
and see you again as part
of our next speaker series.

295
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.300 
Ciao. Bye, thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.260 
we now have a closer look
to intermediate systems.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.630 
You remember the intermediate
systems are needed to

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.050 
interconnect the
different networks.

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.150 
So the internet was made of many
different physical networks

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.910 
and what is needed it is needed
to interconnect them but it's

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.180 
not possible to do this via wire
or another physical media

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.950 
because the different networks
run and are using different

9
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.390 
technologies. They are incompatible.
The signals could not be understood

10
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.510 
on the other side on the other network.
So this intermediate systems

11
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.480 
they need to translate the technology of
the one network into the technology

12
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.240 
of the other network and vice versa and they
have to take care about packet transmission

13
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.420 
between the individual
networks.

14
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.230 
There are different types of
intermediate systems and the different

15
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.000 
types provide different functionality. There are
repeaters, hub, bridges, switches, router,

16
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.660 
gateways and the
offered functionality

17
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.200 
determines the assignment of the
system to a layer in the TCP/IP

18
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.860 
stack. Let's have a closer look
and let's start with consider

19
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.870 
so called repeat. Repeater
work in the lowest layer

20
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.500 
in the hardware layer and are
invisible to higher layers.

21
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.650 
The task of the repeater is to
amplify the electrical signals

22
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.840 
or the radio signals in order to
bridge large distances. You

23
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.510 
remember the physical signals become
weaker and weaker the longer

24
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.090 
the distance they have to bridge this and
this repeater say amplify these signals

25
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.110 
to make them understandable for the
receiver system which is far away.

26
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.310 
The repeater does not exhibit any
specific intelligent behavior.

27
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.610 
The only task it is able to
fulfill is this amplification.

28
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.610 
So repeaters are place that are located
here on the lowest level or the

29
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.070 
hardware layer of the
TCP/IP protocol stack.

30
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.460 
Bridges and switches are other
types of intermediate systems.

31
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.290 
So bridges connect two different LAN,
local area network segments and switches

32
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.780 
connect multiple
LAN segments.

33
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.960 
What they do? They are allowed to extend
a LAN with an intelligent packet

34
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.300 
transmission control.

35
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.420 
So the local transmission this
was a collision domain, you

36
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.840 
remember in local area network
this was a broadcast networks

37
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.820 
are not replicated
via the bridge.

38
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.000 
So we want to
connect to

39
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.710 
LAN segments in
such a way

40
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.580 
that the broadcast is not going
over the inter-connected

41
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.740 
interconnection of the two
transmission lines. The broadcast

42
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.990 
is working here, the broadcast is
working there and if one package

43
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.610 
from here wants to be sent in the
other in the other collision domain

44
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.850 
the switch sees and
understands okay

45
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.700 
switch belongs to both of the
segments, understands it needs

46
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.160 
to be forwarded in this segment and then it
takes this and broadcasts this into that.

47
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.410 
So here we have an intelligent
packet transmission control not

48
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.390 
enlarging the collision domain
which makes it more difficult

49
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.260 
to communicate
with each other.

50
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.560 
So the bridges and switches
are assigned here

51
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.020 
to the first to the link layer
of our protocol stack.

52
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.190 
If you do not remember the
principle of local area networks

53
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.820 
with its forecast and with its
collision domain please go back

54
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.780 
to week two with clips which explain
it, it was explained there.

55
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.510 
The next type of the next type of
intermediate system a very important one

56
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.880 
are router. Routers
are computer

57
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.240 
that are specifically designed to physically
connect multiple computer networks.

58
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.260 
I showed it already. The interconnection
of the networks is done by such

59
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.330 
router intermediate
systems.

60
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.930 
They consist like a computer of
a processor of a memory and

61
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.870 
they have network interfaces for
all networks which are connected

62
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.450 
to the router. And the only
task of such routers is

63
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.730 
to transmit data packets, transmit
data packets on the right

64
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.360 
way through the
internet.

65
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.310 
So they have to transmit data packets
from one network to a neighbour network

66
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.400 
and they have
to translate

67
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.160 
network technology into the other
network technology, for example

68
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.950 
to translate this packet type
a packet format and others.

69
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.350 
This translation of different
network technologies

70
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.720 
this is the characteristic
tasks of routers.

71
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.890 
Address schemes have to be translated,
packet formats have to be translated.

72
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:23.410 
So a router has to be part of all the
network that it connects, so that

73
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.850 
it can receive and can send network
packets inside these networks.

74
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:36.610 
So it is part of the networks
like ordinary user end devices.

75
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.940 
So the connection of independent
networks to an internet this is

76
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.790 
the result of the
work of routers.

77
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.200 
They have to know the technology
of all connected networks

78
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.640 
and they are able to efficiently forward
data packets between different networks.

79
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.960 
So routers are allocated
here to the IP level,

80
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.560 
to the IP layer in the
TCP/IP protocol stack.

81
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.620 
Here you see I already show in another
clip that such router are needed

82
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.730 
to connect the different
networks to each other.

83
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.860 
Don't forget router connecting this
ATM network and this ISDN network

84
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:40.880 
is as well part of this network as well
part of that network, even needs network

85
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.160 
interface cards for both networks
to be able to understand

86
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.700 
the ATM technology, to
understand the ISDN technology

87
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.970 
and to do this
translation work.

88
00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:02.970 
Then we have gateways. Gateways we have
application layer gateways which connect

89
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.290 
the networks on the application
level. So particularly for example

90
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.690 
for the email application
they providethe needed

91
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:19.780 
abilities to interconnect
the email application in

92
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.230 
connected networks. They are
used for communication between

93
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:30.110 
distributed applications or other application
components of distributed systems.

94
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:37.540 
So what they do they convert the
application layer protocols. Here

95
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.320 
the gateway on this utmost layer
of the TCP/IP protocol stack.

96
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.240 
So to qualify the intermediate
systems every time you have

97
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.850 
to think what kind of task they
have to fulfil and on which layer

98
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.790 
this task is solved in the
TCP/IP protocol layer.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.000 
Hi! We want to thank everyone for
participating in the course,

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.790 
for uploading your assignments,
and some of you already started

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.460 
with reviewing your peer's assignments.
We also looked into them

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.750 
and we want to share some examples
today of assignments that

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.910 
we found very interesting. And we
will also explain some questions

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.810 
that came up in the discussion
forum. - So I want to start with

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.210 
the submission by Suhaina. I picked
her testing procedure here

8
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.390 
because I think it's a very
detailed plan of what she thought

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.380 
about before the testing
and also during.

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.150 
So she thought about arranging
a time with testers and

11
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.350 
picking a place that makes
them feel very comfortable,

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.660 
and during the testing I
like that she thought

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.690 
of details such as communicating
how long the testing will

14
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.670 
be and looking at non-verbal
cues and in the end not

15
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
to forget about thanking
the tester for the time.

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.350 
And here is Katja's assignment.
So Katja chose the idea of

17
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.730 
the Availability Scale, and she
built this little prototype

18
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.700 
that looks a bit like
a traffic light.

19
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.640 
And her testing assumption, what
she wanted to know about was

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.690 
whether this traffic light
structure would be understandable

21
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.810 
to different people, if it
would be immediately clear.

22
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.020 
And she chose two very interesting
testers, so she chose one

23
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.000 
person who really needs a quiet
surrounding to work and focus

24
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.350 
and a teacher who is really used to
a noisy background when working.

25
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.990 
And she was able to confirm her
assumption in the test, that

26
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
the traffic light structure
is understandable, and now

27
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.750 
she wants to move on to bigger
prototypes. And I actually would

28
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.200 
be also very interested to see a
prototype like this in a long-term

29
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.280 
testing, to actually see it, for
example, in an office structure.

30
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.720 
So here are some more examples of
prototypes and testing setups:

31
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.930 
So here you can see some
examples for HappyPlants.

32
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.790 
Here you see some
ToolRent Prototypes.

33
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.770 
And some more fun
Availability Scales.

34
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.960 
So these were just a few examples
of interesting prototypes

35
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.400 
that we saw, and there are many more
submissions that are very interesting.

36
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.740 
But now we want to move on to some
questions in the discussion

37
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.100 
forum. - One question
that I picked which I

38
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.900 
found interesting to
think about was that

39
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.050 
you asked whether there are bad
prototypes. And first of all, I would

40
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.240 
say: Don't worry about whether
your prototype is good or bad

41
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.840 
and overthink that, just go out
and your testers will actually

42
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.010 
tell you whether it's a
good one or a bad one.

43
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.710 
But to make sure to
answer that question:

44
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.920 
we think it's valuable that
you think about the testing

45
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.290 
assumption before you go
out there, so to see:

46
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.730 
does your testing
assumption prove to be

47
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.880 
right or wrong, and I think
this kind of answers whether

48
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.110 
it's a good or bad prototype.
We also consider prototypes

49
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.420 
that are not so good those that
testers can't interact with.

50
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.190 
And we were also asked to give
some more examples of testing

51
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.950 
assumptions, or to clear up a bit
more what is a testing assumption.

52
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.170 
So in general this should be
something that you are unsure

53
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.880 
about when building your prototype:
What do you want to know

54
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.760 
more about? Is it the general
desirability of the prototype,

55
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.950 
do people NEED this?, or is it a
key aspect of your prototype

56
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.050 
that you want to learn more about,
for example: do people actually

57
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.230 
want to match up in a sports app
to train with other buddies.

58
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.730 
We also have two examples
from the assignments:

59
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.300 
First, Mykola: So Mykola
wanted to know whether

60
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.050 
these beginner carpenters, people
who did a house renovation

61
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.670 
or home renovation for the first
time, would struggle to find

62
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.110 
the proper tools for a certain
job. So he focused on

63
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.690 
clear instructions or
even a video guide

64
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.510 
to make this clear
to people.

65
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.540 
Snd the learner Patrick
chose the idea of

66
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.000 
HappyPlants, and he focused
on this key aspect of

67
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.760 
people struggle with watering
plants too little or too much.

68
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.550 
So he wanted to know if
the app helps them

69
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.750 
to actually choose the optimal
amount of water to water plants

70
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.280 
with. So these are two testing
assumptions that focus

71
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.040 
more on smaller aspects
within the idea.

72
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.510 
And I picked out another question
which asked to provide more

73
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.900 
content on drawn or sticky note
prototypes and therefore I

74
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.800 
would love to highlight
the advantages here

75
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.960 
and share some further
reading suggestions for you

76
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.080 
in the box below this video. I
also think it's great to check

77
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.310 
out Cong's video on cardboard
prototyping for this question.

78
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.220 
So in short, the advantages of
sticking note or drawn prototypes

79
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.020 
are 1) focus on the content: everyone
can contribute and 2) the speed

80
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.300 
to create. So I'll walk
you through these.

81
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.520 
The first one, the
focus on the content:

82
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.920 
When you start with very
low-fi prototypes, it gives

83
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.110 
you the chance to focus on the
content of your prototype,

84
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.140 
neglecting all the decisions around
design aesthetics or technology.

85
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.220 
For example you can easily think
about the storytelling and

86
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.150 
create an order for different
pages of your prototype.

87
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.040 
Secondly, everyone can
contribute. This means that

88
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.590 
the beauty of sticky note
prototypes, besides using them as

89
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.410 
a first user testing, is that
they help you in a project team

90
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.870 
that everyone can contribute
to them. In this way you

91
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.870 
can, in a very short amount of time,
create a variety of prototypes

92
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.600 
that you could for example
test in an A/B setting

93
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.570 
And lastly, the speed to create.
This is a very rapid way

94
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.230 
to create different
prototypes and it's

95
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.230 
very cool because you can iterate
them super quickly. So when

96
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.230 
you don't like a page, you can just
easily exchange it with something

97
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.480 
else. So yeah it's very fast
and you don't need to put

98
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.300 
a lot of time or effort into it,
like you would have to when

99
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.790 
you would have to change code or
pixels in a digital prototype.

100
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.700 
And now we also want to draw
your attention to another MOOC

101
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700 
on openHPI by our colleagues
Claudia Nicola and Uli Weinberg.

102
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.460 
In their course, they focus on
core principles in Design

103
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.880 
Thinking beyond the
process level, and also

104
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.380 
on Design Thinking application
in organizations. So

105
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.440 
if after this more skill-based
MOOC where we look at different

106
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.530 
skills and methods you're
more interested to

107
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.520 
learn more about the theory
and also this application

108
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.620 
on the organization level,
we would invite you to

109
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.270 
join their MOOC in archive
mode and we will also

110
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.280 
link it below the video. We
encourage you to use these

111
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.570 
last days of the MOOC to review
your peers' assignments.

112
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.480 
Also take a look at the expert videos
of Aravinth, Holger and Steffi

113
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.300 
if you're interested in
advanced prototyping,

114
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.450 
agile methods next to Design
Thinking or introducing Design

115
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.630 
Thinking in an organization. And
also take a look at the transfer

116
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.500 
post in our discussion forum if
you want to think or start

117
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.720 
to think about possibilities to
transfer what you learned in

118
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.770 
this course into your real
life, your professional life.

119
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.980 
And please also remember to
fill in the surveys. This

120
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.220 
course will go in archive mode (after the peer
reviews), this means that you can still

121
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.150 
access all the content and
download the material

122
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.400 
shared with friends and
colleagues. Now it's time to

123
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.000 
say goodbye, so thank you for
being such a curious and active

124
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.940 
learner crowd!

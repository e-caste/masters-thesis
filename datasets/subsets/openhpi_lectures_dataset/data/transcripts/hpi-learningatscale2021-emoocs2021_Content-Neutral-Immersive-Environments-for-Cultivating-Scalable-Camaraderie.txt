00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.260 
hi everybody my name is david joiner,
i am the executive director

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.560 
of online education and mscs at georgia tech's
college of computing

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.270 
in atlanta georgia USA.

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.510 
today i'm going to be talking to
you a bit about our attempts

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.540 
to use virtual reality and immersive
environments to complement online education.

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.280 
the specific title of this work is
content neutral immersive

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.630 
environments for cultivating scalable camaraderie.

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.480 
it's the work of myself and three
graduate students at georgia tech

9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.830 
aqeel malik, handy shiny metal and technic,
as well as blair

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.670 
mcintyre who works with
both georgia tech and mozilla.

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.200 
now in order to talk about this work,
i think it's useful for

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.640 
us to start by talking about our goal
and really operationalizing

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.010 
some of these terms. our goal is
to cultivate scalable camaraderie in online education

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.500 
using content neutral immersive environments.
but what does that mean exactly

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
well to start with the easy part,
online education for this

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.410 
for our context is a large online
and fully asynchronous degree program

17
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.870 
in computer science. that's what we work on.
but we hope what

18
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.810 
we find here is applicable to moose
and other degree programs

19
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.710 
in other fields and other topics as well.

20
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.510 
for camaraderie it has been observed
or defined to be the most

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.740 
advanced stage of community formation
in distance learning.

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.050 
it's characterized by a feeling
of connection to your classmates

23
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.350 
that isn't based on any particular interaction,
but rather forms

24
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.940 
as a result of the sum total of
many interactions over time.

25
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.830 
many of which may not even be direct interactions.

26
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.780 
when we say scalable what we mean
is that the approaches should require

27
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.410 
minimal or no additional effort
from the teaching staff as

28
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.630 
enrollment grows, if these efforts
are going to require teaching

29
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.870 
staff to invest another hour
for every fifty students who enroll.

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's not really scalable we want
to develop things that can

31
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.900 
scale no matter how big
a particular course ends up being.

32
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.230 
and by immersive environments
what we mean is environments that carry the

33
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.270 
peripheral context and spatial
relationships of real world locations.

34
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.810 
very often online we're dealing
with web forums and chat rooms

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.650 
and things like that,
where it's a very narrow channel of communication.

36
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.900 
we're looking at environments
that replicate more of what it's

37
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.280 
like to interact in person
where it's not just face to face

38
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.810 
like you are over webcam.
but it's also the experience of sitting

39
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.390 
in the same room with other people
so that even if you're not

40
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.970 
talking to them directly,
you still have that sense of being

41
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.540 
in the same place with others
going through a shared experience.

42
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.760 
our belief is that kind of experience
could be the key to building

43
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.910 
this kind of camaraderie in online environments.

44
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.130 
and finally by content neutral
what we mean is that we want

45
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.590 
to develop environments that are not
tied to specific content like a

46
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.220 
virtual reality simulation
in physics or an immersive exploring

47
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.170 
environment in ecology.
but we want to develop environments

48
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.670 
that can be used across many different subject
areas very similar to how a

49
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.890 
real classroom can be used
for a computer science class right now，

50
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.790 
and a writing class and
an hour physics class after that.

51
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.560 
we want to develop this kind
of content neutral environment

52
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.500 
so that they can have a wide impact across
multiple different subject areas.

53
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.320 
so that's our goal. we want to cultivate
camaraderie in a scalable way

54
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.020 
so that students in online
education feel more connected to

55
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.040 
their classmates. and we want
to do it in a way that can be

56
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.080 
used across multiple subject areas
using very content neutral immersive environments.

57
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.570 
so how do we actually go about doing this,
we decided to use mozilla hubs.

58
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.710 
partially because mozilla
gave us a grant to explore the use

59
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.130 
of hubs in online education.
but we applied for that because

60
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.020 
mozilla hubs has a number
of features that make it uniquely

61
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.120 
compatible with what we're trying to do here.

62
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.720 
for one it's browser-based
which means anyone with a smartphone

63
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.890 
or laptop or computer
can access these environments.

64
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.320 
so we're not relying on students
having fancy equipment.

65
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.150 
but hubs is vr compatible，
so for those students who have a vr headset.

66
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.650 
they can access the environment
using that headset, so we can experiment

67
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.610 
with whether vr might be a way to foster
this kind of camaraderie

68
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.330 
or whether any kind of
immersive environment could do it.

69
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.150 
so hubs has a number of features
that are useful for our purposes.

70
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.060 
it's also open source meaning anything
that we discover here

71
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.110 
could be more quickly used
at other schools and other subject

72
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.320 
areas without having to worry
about licensing and everything like that.

73
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.200 
so to start we brainstormed
a number of different content neutral environments.

74
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.570 
we observed on traditional college campuses that

75
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.840 
we wanted to recreate in these immersive environments.

76
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.120 
the first we came up with
was a lecture hall where students gather to synchronously watch a

77
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.380 
presentation from their instructor
maybe raise their hand and

78
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.310 
ask questions pause for class
discussion and maybe work problems in groups.

79
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.970 
the second we came up
with was a poster session which

80
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.720 
would be an environment to allow
students to present their

81
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.500 
work to their classmates in
a more casual environment compared to

82
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.270 
an all class presentation.
the third were office hours with a faculty member,

83
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.780 
not just to talk directly to
the faculty member because that

84
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.520 
would be quite scalable,
but also to do kind of what you do in office hours

85
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.950 
on a real college campus where
you might see the posters that

86
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.160 
the professor has presented conferences,
see the books that

87
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.770 
they have in their office kind of get that
that immersion in their world.

88
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.190 
and then the fourth was
the social lounge which would be a

89
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.640 
gathering places where students
can get together interact and socialize

90
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.320 
maybe work on class material
together maybe just talk.

91
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.370 
but a way to create a place
for students to gather and interact and

92
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.770 
connect to each other,
that isn't necessarily anchored to the class meeting time.

93
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.960 
so we built these environments
in mozilla hubs and then we

94
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.500 
wanted to evaluate them with real students.
so we did five studies.

95
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.290 
we did a study that just
set a baseline to understand students'

96
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.220 
prior experiences and beliefs
about vr virtual environments and education.

97
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.290 
and then we did studies
on the social lounge the poster session,

98
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.230 
and then two different studies
on the lecture hall. and we tried

99
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.520 
one on the office hours,
but not enough students showed up for us to really

100
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.010 
derive any conclusions.

101
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.350 
so for the first study
we just wanted to understand what students

102
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.950 
already think about virtual reality
in virtual environments,

103
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.500 
and how they can be useful in online education.
so we recruited

104
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.760 
students from two classes to complete
a survey about their beliefs and experiences.

105
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.960 
and we found a few different things.
we found that very few

106
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.880 
students regularly use virtual reality
even in an online mscs program where we

107
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.250 
would expect to see many early adopters.

108
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.920 
we found unsurprisingly that
many students feel relatively

109
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.360 
disconnected from online classmates
and they crave more interaction

110
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.530 
with their classmates in online education.
and we found that

111
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.010 
most students are interestingly
optimistic about the proposed

112
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.770 
virtual environments to aid community building.
and that will

113
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.860 
be a running theme we see through
all our studies that there's

114
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.110 
some optimism about the future potential
of initiatives like this

115
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.810 
even when the present hasn't quite
caught up with that potential.

116
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.910 
for our study on the social lounge
we recruited students from

117
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.210 
four different classes to attend scheduled
social lounges specific to their class.

118
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.610 
so we just invited them ask them
to fill out a survey,

119
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
if they came we did nothing else
to facilitate interaction or to offer

120
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.920 
activities or anything like that.

121
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.470 
we just invited them to see what
they would do our key findings were

122
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.720 
one in the absence of any kind
of anchor for activity students

123
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.490 
struggled to quickly establish
social norms for interaction.

124
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.430 
and two only forty three percent
felt it improved their experience

125
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.270 
in the class, but eighty nine
percent would attend a similar lounge,

126
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.540 
again which was interesting.

127
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.560 
then for our post-recession study
we recruited students who

128
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.880 
were already in a class that
had a final presentation and for

129
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.970 
them we offered to let them present via this immersive poster session

130
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.720 
instead of the typical filmed video presentation, and then we

131
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.250 
invited other students to attend the poster session and we

132
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.110 
asked them all to complete a survey students reflected positively

133
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.660 
on the added social connection, and on the authentic presentation

134
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.480 
experience i noted. they felt it might be a good preparation

135
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.890 
for doing similar things for real conferences, because i got

136
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.180 
to answer live questions and have that live back and forth.

137
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.100 
we also found that the technological overhead was both a distraction and a deterrent.

138
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.730 
all the things that go into having this true three d virtual environment

139
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.220 
kind of took away from the content of the individual posters,

140
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.470 
which suggest there might be something we can do to streamline it.

141
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.830 
to focus on content while still supporting this kind of peripheral interaction.

142
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.330 
like i said before we did two different studies on the lecture hall environment.

143
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.050 
the first was exploratory just to get students feedback on

144
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.450 
the potential of the interface.
from one class we recruited students to begin

145
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.220 
attending optional twice a week watching sessions and to complete

146
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.480 
surveys on their experience. what we found was that students

147
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.520 
attach significant interest to this sort of co-watching mechanism.

148
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.980 
there's an enormous amount of interest over a third of the

149
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.850 
class attended the first one to the point where the environment crashed.

150
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.520 
and we had to cancel that session because the interface

151
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.460 
wouldn't handle fifty people in a room at a time.

152
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.310 
but we also found that despite the positive feedback attendance

153
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.490 
fell off fast and attendees mostly said
they would be re watching recorded content later.

154
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.640 
so they weren't getting enough out of it to keep coming back.

155
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.130 
and they weren't getting enough out of it to not have

156
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.300 
to watch the video again on their own later. then we also did

157
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.080 
a controlled study which was partially, because we observed

158
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.660 
it the way students use the vr environment was they very often

159
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.790 
just position their avatar somewhere where it could see the

160
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.610 
virtual screen, and then they would do all their interaction

161
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.790 
via the text chat box. so we wanted to see could we streamline

162
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.150 
this?
could we do something that's useful without all the overhead of vr ?

163
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.910 
so we introduced the third condition using a tool called sync

164
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.140 
educate which was a chat based co- watching tool.

165
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.270 
and what we found in this controlled experiment was none of

166
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.280 
the conditions affected the level of social connection students

167
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.900 
experienced. they all had a slightly disconnected feel the beginning

168
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.910 
of the study and that same level of disconnection at the end

169
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.230 
of the study as evaluated by a standard social connectedness inventory.

170
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.040 
what we also found was interesting was the

171
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.110 
email condition where we just have students do a little email

172
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.990 
discussion group totally asynchronously delivered more immediate

173
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.960 
advantages than the other two, but the other two had students

174
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.340 
reflecting more positively on the experience and its future

175
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.440 
potential. so they got more out of just doing a simple email group,

176
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.990 
but they were more likely to want to use the chat tool or the hubs tool

177
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.480 
in the future. so we see that as evidence that there's some

178
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.880 
difference between the present reality of the tool. and the

179
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.990 
potential students see from the future application of the tool.

180
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.790 
so from those five studies we derived four findings and then four softer observations.

181
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.840 
first we confirmed that students still feel isolated in online educational settings,

182
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.950 
even though the internet and social networking have gotten so much more
ubiquitous.

183
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.480 
we can hope to find that students find it very easy

184
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.000 
to socialize online in their online classes nowadays,

185
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.010 
but that didn't seem to be the case.

186
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.060 
our second finding though was that students were very optimistic

187
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.240 
about the role that immersive environments and vr could play

188
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.130 
in resolving that isolation they

189
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.900 
reflected positively on the potential, and after experiencing

190
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.770 
some of these settings they were likely to want to do it again,

191
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.400 
even when they were a bit lukewarm about how effective the

192
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.610 
experience they just had was. so they reflect more positively

193
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.930 
on the future potential than they do on
what they immediately experienced.

194
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.960 
our third finding was that students are regularly distracted

195
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.990 
by these immersive environments,
but they regard the experience

196
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.550 
positively anyway which is interesting,
because it says that

197
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:17.050 
were we're adding something to
the experience by adding in these peripheral contexts

198
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.120 
that they're losing and it's worth being
distracted a bit from the material.

199
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.740 
especially given that in this asynchronous environment they

200
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.470 
can always go back and watch on their own later if they want to.

201
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.580 
and our fourth findings are
that there are significant technical

202
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.870 
obstacles to further adoption of
these environments presenting

203
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.670 
what i'd say is a chicken egg problem
or causality dilemma.

204
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.160 
which is that in order for us to
use virtual reality more commonly in online education,

205
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.410 
we need more students to have vr headsets.

206
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.520 
but in order for students to
buy vr headsets they need to know

207
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.960 
that they're going to have some
usefulness and that's kind

208
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.900 
of a chicken egg problem. we think
that environments like mozilla

209
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.740 
hubs could give us a a powerful
way of resolving that,

210
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.460 
because you don't have to have vr to interact.
but if you do you get

211
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.930 
something more out of the experience
so it gets people in the

212
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.170 
door and enticing them to invest more
in the experience going forward.

213
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.180 
then for our softer observations about the experience,

214
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.730 
we found that students require
an anchor for activity to understand

215
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.010 
how the environment is intended to be used otherwise they just

216
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.020 
stand around awkwardly wondering am i supposed to talk i supposed

217
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.450 
to chat, should i use all these tools that i have available to me.

218
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.460 
so it's good to provide them some anchors of activities some

219
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.580 
guidelines on what they should be doing.
and similarly our second

220
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.490 
observation is that students lack a collective understanding

221
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.690 
of the norms of a virtual environment,
like does it matter,

222
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.370 
if i put my avatar too close to other people doesn't matter,

223
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.980 
if i face them while we're talking as long as we can hear each other.

224
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.910 
things like that it's just not clear what you're supposed to

225
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.160 
do in these new environments. our third observation is that

226
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160 
those take time to develop but typical interventions are pretty

227
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.770 
short term. and they don't give enough time for these norms to form

228
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.980 
in our control experiment we had groups meeting together for

229
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.760 
three consecutive weeks and by the end of those three weeks.

230
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.320 
we were starting to see some norms forming. so it takes at least

231
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.750 
a couple weeks of doing this at least once a week for those

232
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.730 
begin to to develop. we won't really know the potential

233
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.760 
of these environments, until they're given the time to fully develop.

234
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.700 
and the fourth is that despite our focus in online education

235
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.020 
and communities and things like that on direct interaction.

236
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.370 
students reflect most positively on peripheral interactions,

237
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.390 
so just the idea of being in a room together and being aware of your classmates

238
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.390 
is what students seem to be most positive about in these environments.

239
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.100 
now it's important to note that these studies all took place before covid hit,

240
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.410 
and now we've had a year of doing online education in this

241
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.740 
emergency situation. we can reflect also
on how sam we found in these studies,

242
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.310 
applies what we've learned over the past year, one is that interfaces

243
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.840 
like gather lee and gather town emerged after we did these studies.

244
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.390 
and they supply much of the benefit that we saw here they supply

245
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.640 
that peripheral interaction that more casual interaction, but

246
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.890 
they don't have nearly as much overhead as a three d immersive

247
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.040 
virtual environment. so i think what we're seeing is that it is definitely possible

248
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.660 
to create these environments these immersive areas for students

249
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.470 
interact with each other in a way that doesn't require so much technical overhead.

250
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.160 
our second is that things like the lecture hall

251
00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.650 
really seem to have been pressions in what students were going

252
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.440 
to want to see in education during the pandemic. video watching

253
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.080 
interfaces on youtube netflix and facebook and other places

254
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.390 
really took off during the pandemic, because i think they offer

255
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.830 
a distributed social experience. and so i think what we'll see

256
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.850 
is that students really are open to the idea of co- watching

257
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.910 
pre recorded lectures together. so they can talk and discuss

258
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.750 
and answer each other's questions live and get that social

259
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.330 
interaction anchored the material itself, as well

260
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.660 
in third hubs and other platforms added lots of new features

261
00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.130 
which may fundamentally change the nature of the interaction

262
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.650 
which could change the results of these studies. so i think what we saw

263
00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.300 
is that the optimism students had about the potential of these interfaces

264
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.200 
has been unlocked as a result of the need for
online education in online environments over the past year.

265
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.260 
so that's our study on virtual reality in

266
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.790 
immersive environments in online education. if you'd like to

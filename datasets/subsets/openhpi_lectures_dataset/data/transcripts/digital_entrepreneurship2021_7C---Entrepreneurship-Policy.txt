1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.010 
So, how can we measure an
entrepreneurial ecosystem?

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.260 
By the number of start-ups, the
number of actors within the

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.950 
ecosystem, or the rate of
entrepreneurial activities?

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.060 
And what role do entrepreneurship
policies play? Can they actually

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.470 
create or shape an
entrepreneurial ecosystem?

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.480 
Let's find out what entrepreneurship
researchers have to say about these questions.

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.080 


8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.210 
Welcome to our video on the topic
of "Entrepreneurship Policy".

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.210 
My name is Katharina Hölzle and for
this video Valeska Maul and I

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.370 
will discuss the current scientific
debate on the measurement

11
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.840 
of entrepreneurial ecosystems and how policy
initiatives can actually address

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.470 
different elements to drive
the performance of

13
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.630 
an entrepreneurial
ecosystem.

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.430 
A major research stream within the realm
of entrepreneurial ecosystems

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.540 
focuses on how to actually measure
them. To date, there is no

16
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.500 
unified opinion between
entrepreneurship researchers on how

17
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
to measure them and which factors
should be taken into consideration.

18
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.190 
The reasons behind this lacking
consensus are multifaceted.

19
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.890 
One difficulty when measuring
entrepreneurial ecosystems is

20
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.210 
that they don't always present clear
boundaries. Instead, entrepreneurial

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.580 
ecosystems often overlap with each
other and are dynamic by nature.

22
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.010 
According to Stamm and Spigel,
another difficulty arises when

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.650 
looking at the cause and effect relationship
between entrepreneurial ecosystem factors

24
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.850 
and entrepreneurial
activities.

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.580 
Does the ecosystem create
entrepreneurial activities, or does

26
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.380 
the ecosystem emerge because of
increasing entrepreneurial activities?

27
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.690 
Over time, entrepreneurship researchers have
discussed different factors when measuring

28
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.310 
the dynamics of entrepreneurial ecosystems,
namely output, outcome, and impact.

29
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.280 
When it comes to output, we understand entrepreneurial
activities or productive entrepreneurship.

30
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.980 
We can measure output by different
indicators, such as the number of

31
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.750 
high-growth startups for
example within the ecosystem.

32
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.070 
In contrast, the outcome of an entrepreneur
ecosystem refers to value creation.

33
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.990 
Value is created by commercializing
new ideas and technologies,

34
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.190 
job creation, or by improving market
efficiency through competition.

35
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.160 
Lastly, the factor impact is the eventual
goal of an entrepreneurial ecosystem.

36
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.570 
Here, the factor refers to creating
new value in society by

37
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.910 
developing an entrepreneurial
ecosystem as a virtuous cycle.

38
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.230 
Entrepreneurship scholars call for
more research that particularly

39
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.830 
focuses on the outcome and the impact
measurement of entrepreneurial ecosystems.

40
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.650 
In view, this is to enable comparisons and to
improve the functioning of entrepreneurial ecosystems.

41
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.470 
The entrepreneurship scholar Ben Spigel
suggests a more differentiated

42
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.970 
perspective when assessing
entrepreneurial ecosystems.

43
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.650 
Rather than merely focusing on
the outcome of entrepreneurial

44
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.020 
activities and high rates
of entrepreneurship,

45
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.040 
we should focus on attributes that
create and sustain this outcome.

46
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.840 
These attributes provide resources to
ventures that otherwise could not succeed.

47
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.690 
In his opinion successful ecosystems are not
defined by high rates of entrepreneurship

48
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.100 
but rather how the interaction between
these attributes creates a supportive

49
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.220 
regional environment that increases
the competitiveness of new ventures.

50
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.740 
He also emphasizes that the performance
of ecosystems depends on many different

51
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.710 
influential attributes.

52
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.880 
These include first, cultural
attributes, such as the history

53
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.090 
of entrepreneurship and
a supportive culture,

54
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.070 
second, social attributes such as
networks and talents, and third,

55
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.220 
material attributes, such as the
physical infrastructure,

56
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.290 
or the presence
of universities.

57
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.980 
Now, you might ask yourself, why is it relevant
to measure entrepreneurial ecosystems at all?

58
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.230 
A core motivation to measure entrepreneurial
ecosystem is so that policy-makers

59
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.390 
can develop relevant entrepreneurship
policies and, in the process,

60
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.990 
can determine how these are affecting
the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

61
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.700 
As stated by the entrepreneurship
scholar Peter Vogel

62
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.250 
"if we do not measure the effectiveness of
the various components in an ecosystem

63
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.760 
as well as the ecosystem as a
whole, we will not be able to

64
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.660 
improve existing programs and put in
place new and complimentary programs".

65
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.490 
So, entrepreneurship policies aim at strengthening
the entrepreneurial ecosystem by creating

66
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.310 
this supportive environment.
Policymakers worldwide have developed

67
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.820 
a plethora of initiatives to create
and stimulate different forms of

68
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.890 
entrepreneurial ecosystems. They can
create a supportive environment

69
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.390 
primarily through two
types of intervention.

70
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.940 
First, by improving institutional conditions,
such as changing the tax regulations.

71
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.980 
And second, by providing direct
support through, for example,

72
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.220 
training and
networking programs.

73
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.050 
In Germany, we have the so called
"Digital Hub Initiative" founded

74
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.070 
in two thousand seventeen by the Federal
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy.

75
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.070 
This initiative supports and improves networking
between start-ups and established companies

76
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.140 
by bringing the different actors
together in one ecosystem,

77
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.050 
which is called a "hub".

78
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.180 
Currently, we have twelve different
digital hubs throughout

79
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.340 
Germany with different digital foci such
as AI, digital health, and cyber security.

80
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.320 
The development and implementation of
policies for entrepreneurial ecosystems

81
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.110 
is not an easy endeavor
for multiple reasons.

82
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.430 
For example, oftentimes, knowledge
about the entrepreneurial ecosystem

83
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.190 
is distributed between multiple stakeholders
through one-on-one interactions.

84
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.100 
The ecosystem also consists of
different types of stakeholders

85
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.930 
from the private and public sectors
with different objectives.

86
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.090 
An alignment of their goals
is not always possible.

87
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.020 
And they don't really
want to, right?

88
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.040 
Of course, policy makers need to
decide which element of the

89
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.820 
entrepreneurial ecosystem they aim to
address. Entrepreneurial ecosystems

90
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.350 
often portray a complex and
interconnected structure, and one

91
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.680 
has to identify elements or
links which should be improved

92
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.790 
within the ecosystem in order to
develop an effective policy.

93
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.130 
During the process of developing, implementing,
and evaluating entrepreneurship policies,

94
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.820 
policy-makers can receive feedback and
advice from policy advisory committees.

95
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.610 
Katherina Hölzle is an active member of
two German policy advisory committees,

96
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.050 
the High-Tech Forum and the Commission
of Experts for Research and Innovation.

97
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.490 
As a member of these two committees,
I aim to include my scientific

98
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:14.790 
perspective as a researcher and professor when
assessing entrepreneurial and innovation activities

99
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.420 
and advising the German federal
government on questions of

100
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.150 
innovation and entrepreneurship
policy. Based on our assessments,

101
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.730 
we develop recommendation reports to
hand over to the central policymakers,

102
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.890 
such as the chancellor or
the involved ministries.

103
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.870 
We have provided the links to
both the High-Tech Forum and

104
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.010 
the Commission of Experts and
their published reports if you

105
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.830 
are interested
in our work.

106
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.060 
We hope that you found the session on
entrepreneurship policy to be insightful,

107
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.490 
and make sure to check out
our next video. See you!

1
00:00:01.071 --> 00:00:03.220 
Hello and welcome. We are very happy

2
00:00:03.221 --> 00:00:05.540 
that you're joining us. In this session

3
00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:07.090 
we will talk about a powerful tool

4
00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.620 
for finding inspirations for design solutions.

5
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.540 
Paying attention to how people interact with their surroundings

6
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:23.070 
will give us a lot of valuable insights about their lives,

7
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.180 
their wishes, their pain points or dislikes.

8
00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:27.580 
More importantly,

9
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:29.640 
sometimes people are not able to point out

10
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.190 
or formulate what they really need.

11
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.730 
So paying attention to how they interact

12
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:36.020 
in their own context

13
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:40.040 
will lead us to a lot of valuable discoveries about them

14
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.990 
and also gives us some hints about how to design

15
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.250 
meaningful solutions for them.

16
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:46.350 
Watch out for workarounds

17
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.140 
and misuses because they are a great source of inspiration,

18
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:52.180 
Workarounds are creative fast fixes

19
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:54.420 
that people use when they face a problem.

20
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:57.150 
These are usually meant to be temporary solutions,

21
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:58.730 
but sometimes it takes a while

22
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:01.520 
until people recognize their design potential.

23
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.620 
In addition, sometimes people come up with alternative

24
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.580 
uses for products and services to fulfill a need

25
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:09.880 
that is unadressed.

26
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:13.310 
Another sign for an untapped opportunity here -

27
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:16.050 
of course only if you're paying close attention.

28
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.100 
Let me give you an example.

29
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:19.960 
Take a couple of seconds

30
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:21.920 
to think about what you're seeing in this picture.

31
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.730 
What is the problem

32
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.160 
that this person is trying to solve with his

33
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:31.020 
or her temporary solution?

34
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.000 
What do you think is the unmet need here?

35
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:37.900 
As you might have guessed,

36
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.180 
this is a great way to organize

37
00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:43.170 
the messy cable situation that we are all familiar with.

38
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:46.600 
There's also a need for a more tidy

39
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.280 
and organized workspace

40
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:50.080 
that this person is trying to achieve

41
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:52.560 
through this workaround

42
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:56.830 
that he or she is using. For spotting design opportunities

43
00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:58.760 
and discovering people's hidden needs

44
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.130 
you need to adopt a curious mindset,

45
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.080 
like a good detective that pays attention to every detail.

46
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:05.760 
Be a tourist at home,

47
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:08.710 
and look at your surrounding with a fresh set of eyes

48
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:10.250 
and let yourself be surprised.

49
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.660 
Let me give you an example of how good observation

50
00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:15.040 
led to solving a problem

51
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:17.300 
that an important group of people was facing.

52
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.180 
Europe is going through a major demographic change.

53
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:21.500 
Our population is aging

54
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:25.440 
and as we age, our physical and emotional needs change as well.

55
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:26.800 
A lot of products

56
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:29.610 
and services are designed for the average user, though.

57
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.170 
So there's a lot of design opportunity

58
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:34.200 
and potential to address the needs

59
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.670 
and problems of elderly people.

60
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:37.670 
This is also a potential

61
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:40.390 
that Lapeyre, a French furniture company, saw

62
00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:42.050 
and they gave a challenge to a Stanford

63
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:43.070 
ME three ten (ME310) course,

64
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:45.340 
consisting of a team from the Paris d.school,

65
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:47.470 
and from the HPI Potsdam.

66
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.720 
They challenged them

67
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:51.780 
to redesign the bathroom experience of elderly people

68
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:54.550 
in order to gain more autonomy in their own homes.

69
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:57.570 
To understand the challenge better,

70
00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:01.080 
the team embarked on an intensive field research.

71
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.390 
One of the things that they looked into

72
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.450 
in order to understand the needs and desires

73
00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:08.690 
of the elderly was to observe their morning

74
00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:09.680 
routines and rituals.

75
00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:15.730 
Since the bathroom routine is a intimates and private activity,

76
00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:19.040 
they utilized their own social circle.

77
00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:22.600 
So, they observed their grandparents morning rituals.

78
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:25.650 
An interesting observation was from one of the team

79
00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:26.900 
members grandmother,

80
00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:30.690 
Jaqueline. She would go between her bathroom and bed

81
00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:33.030 
a couple of times during her morning routines,

82
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:35.520 
because she needed to sit down to do tasks

83
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.550 
such as applying cream on her feet.

84
00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.180 
The team realized that many of the problems

85
00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:42.490 
they had come across before

86
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.480 
when talking to other users were

87
00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:45.790 
actually linked to Jacqulineâ€™s problem

88
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:48.870 
namely the lack of piece of furniture in the bathroom

89
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:50.930 
that would allow for a comfortable morning right.

90
00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:54.010 
This was the spark for their design solution.

91
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:56.180 
Through many prototypes in iterations

92
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:57.650 
they created the ConceptCare,

93
00:03:57.651 --> 00:03:59.810 
which is a sink table furniture.

94
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.320 
This piece of furniture addresses

95
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.640 
the core needs of elderly people in the bathroom,

96
00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:07.080 
for example, that they need to sit down, that

97
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:10.690 
they need to be able to see themselves in the mirror clearly,

98
00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:12.200 
and to reach storage space

99
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:12.960 
while sitting.

100
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:16.020 
Also, it's a non-stigmatizing design.

101
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:18.750 
It doesn't tell the user that they are old,

102
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.130 
Actually, when the team did their testing,

103
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.290 
they realized the elderly people

104
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.520 
are the extreme uses of the bathroom

105
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:27.700 
and that a solution that caters to their needs

106
00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:30.390 
will also cater to the needs of other users.

107
00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:32.470

ThisIsDesignThinking.net,

110
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:40.150 
which is a blog where we collect stories

111
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:43.650 
or case stories of design thinking implementation in organizations.

112
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:45.730 
So in this session,

113
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:48.900 
we talked about the power of good and careful observation

114
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.110 
and finding design inspirations from workarounds

115
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:56.080 
and misuses. We hope that we have unlocked your curiosity.

116
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:59.120 
We have prepared an exercise for you to practice

117
00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:00.410 
your observation skills,

118
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:04.170 
and also an assignment for you to apply your learning.

119
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:06.000 
Okay, have fun with that

120
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:06.980 
and see you next week!

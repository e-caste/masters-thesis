WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.000 
And since we're going to do
teamwork or might do teamwork...

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.940 
So yes somehow you
need to share

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.790 
your projects with others. One way
to do that, not the best one,

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.270 
we will see a better way in
the future, but one way

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.880 
to do that would be to export your
project and someone else could

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.340 
import from that state the project
currently is in. Should we show

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.140 
that to the participants? I
guess we could do that.

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.300 
Yeah, so, then let's first correct
our code again by deleting

9
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.590 
let's say the second half of the
program, which was not yet finished.

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.120 
Ok, so let's do
the following.

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.000 
We do a right click
on the project,

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
and then we have
this nice option

13
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.160 
and it says export and we get
tons of options and we have

14
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.430 
basically the "General"
option, which contains

15
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.260 
"Archive file" that
would be one way to go.

16
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.220 
Or we could go for the java way
to do things and we could

17
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.290 
create a jar file.
Basically, the same.

18
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.750 
A .jar file internally is more
less as a .zip. Named .jar.

19
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.200 
So let's go for the
general option and

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.810 
we use the archive file...
ok... and then we're asked

21
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
what we actually want to export so we
want to export the capstone project.

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
It should contain these

23
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.470 
files here so that when
everything is imported

24
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.560 
again it's there so that the
Eclipse of the partner

25
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.900 
knows what to do. The "classpath"
basically tells our

26
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.430 
Eclipse and the compiler later
on where your source files are

27
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.440 
actually located. So you've seen
that there's a source folder

28
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.000 
here and of course the compiler
needs to know where to look for

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.300 
the source files and the ".project"
file contains some information

30
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.530 
how the project is set up. So, which
libraries to include and so on.

31
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.780 
So now you need to specify
where you want to have that.

32
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.480 
So you choose something here,
maybe in the workspace.

33
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.690 
Then you give it a nice
title and that would be

34
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
"capstone1" and
then you save, you can

35
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.220 
choose if you want to save it
in a .zip archive or a .tar.

36
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.440 
In this case you should
also name it tar.

37
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.930 
It should create the directory
structure for you,

38
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.810 
normally you keep that selected.
Or you can say I only want

39
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.170 
to create some selected
directories.

40
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.110 
That's it. You go
"finish".

41
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.710 
And now that we've saved
that, we can go to

42
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.920 
our finder and locate
it. And here you see

43
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.760 
there it is. We just created it, and if
you're curious we can also unpack it.

44
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.720 
So there's nothing
magically in there.

45
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.360 
Depending on your operating
system , you can just

46
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.930 
double-click it or select
some tool to unpack it.

47
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.200 
You know how to work with
".zip" files I guess.

48
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.020 
In here we have the ".classpath", the
".project" files, some settings

49
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.170 
for Eclipse. And
then we have

50
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.190 
"bin" folder, and the
"bin" folder actually contains the

51
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.390 
java classes so that's
the compiled code.

52
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.210 
And you see are
already in the

53
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.220 
in the bin folder that this
package structure that we

54
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.740 
created is
represented as

55
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.780 
folders and at the lowest
level you'll find the actual

56
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.300 
artefacts so the class
files. And then we

57
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.910 
have the source folder and
in the source folder

58
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.310 
we actually have the source code
and we see the same structure

59
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.130 
here same package structure
represented as folders

60
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
is our java file
and the java file

61
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.890 
contains the source
code, we can open that

62
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.300 
and you can see there's
no magic here.

63
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.520 
OK Ralf, so now that I've
done all the hard work and

64
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.370 
exported the project for you,
you can import it into your

65
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.220 
workspace and, yeah,

66
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.890 
show me how to do that. OK,
it actually you're going to

67
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.130 
do it because I can't
control your notebook.

68
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.870 
But, I will tell you how to do
that. OK, so what we do is

69
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.600 
we once again have a
blank workspace because

70
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.340 
now let's assume this is mine
and we just right click

71
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.280 
in the project or package explorer
and say "Import" because

72
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.190 
we want to import something. OK, and
now comes the hard part. There

73
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.850 
are dozens of options at least
already on the general there's

74
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.800 
"archive file" which seems
to be correct, but don't choose this

75
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.060 
one. There's "Existing
project into workspace",

76
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.350 
which is better ,and there is also
"Projects from folder or archive".

77
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.240 
Which sounds even better but
that's also not the right one.

78
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.140 
So, they're working but then
do some strange things

79
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.280 
on top of that, so we want to have
"Existing project into workspace".

80
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.030 
This one is good then we
press "Next".

81
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.850 
here we select the second option so
select "Archive file"

82
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.850 
We can also do it if we already
have something extracted

83
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.540 
on our hard-drive, we can
select the root directory,

84
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.970 
but in this case we want to
select an archive file

85
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.610 
can press browse or just check
the thing we have here, so, we

86
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.750 
want to have the "capstone1.zip.
So, I email that file to you!

87
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.600 
Yeah, good old email.

88
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.730 
Ok, open it, and Eclipse already
sees, ok there's one project

89
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.080 
in there there might be
several, so we can

90
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.950 
also .zip together several projects.
But in this case we've just

91
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.300 
the capstone1 project, I'm really
excited what all will be

92
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.720 
in there, from source code's side.
Some more options which we don't

93
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.610 
need and we just press finish.
Let me click that for you.

94
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.370 
On the left hand side we see
once again our project and

95
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.740 
it has a source folder
with our package...

96
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.510 
and the Java
library linked...

97
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.440 
and our magnificent Main file
with our Main class and

98
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.560 
our main method. Now let's
have a look at the

99
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.920 
at the file system and
we will show you that,

100
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.300 
actually, in the file system,
which is here, it looks

101
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.030 
exactly the same as
within the .zip file.

102
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.380 
So we have the
capstone1 folder,

103
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.090 
the "bin", the source files...
let's not get over that all again.

104
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.640 
We just wanted to show
you: also no magic

105
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.450 
in the workspace.
Exactly.

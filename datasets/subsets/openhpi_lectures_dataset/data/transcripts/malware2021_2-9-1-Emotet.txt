00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.090 
In our OpenHPI course "Cyberthreats by Malware"
now we consider Emotet.

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.590 
Emotet, that is the message in the news over
the past years, Emotet has produced

3
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.640 
headlines in
various fields

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240 
and reported about
surf results.

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.220 
Emotet attacks account for 7
percent of malware infections globally,

6
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.870 
based on is this Check Point's
Global Threat Index

7
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.050 
from December 2020. So
it's really a very common

8
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.430 
attack this Emotet.

9
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.890 
So far emotet has managed to
infect various institutions

10
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.420 
around the world and
this was a reason of these

11
00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.690 
headlines because
so many important institutions were infected.

12
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
So in the last year the
infection of many cities around

13
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.120 
the world, many cities in
the US, cities in Germany

14
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.190 
for example Potsdam or
government departments in different

15
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.340 
countries for example,
department of justice

16
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.590 
in a Quebec in Canada or National
Centre of Public Health in Lithuania.

17
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.750 
So really important institutions not
only home users with eventually not

18
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.230 
not professionally configured systems
know the attacker want to attack

19
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.010 
such important
universities,

20
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.520 
important institutions in Germany, for

21
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.960 
example the university GieÃŸen
and then around the world other

22
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.610 
cities, companies, websites

23
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.390 
as mentioned 7 percent of all the attacks.

24
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.730 
What is the malware that is misused
here for emotet attacks?

25
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.210 
This malware can be
classified as a virus,

26
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.260 
because it needs
interaction from the user

27
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.030 
to infect the system
and spread over.

28
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.760 
Usually it spreads via emails,
emails with malicious

29
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.860 
attachments, or links to malicious website,

30
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.650 
to malicious URLs. And when the
user opens this attachment, when

31
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.510 
the user follows a link

32
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.920 
to the website, then the
user gets infected.

33
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.450 
It has to be actively accessed/
opened by the user, this is like

34
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.910 
in case of virus the user has to do
something and before this malware

35
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.800 
could start to do its work.

36
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.410 
What kind of actions

37
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.740 
are taken by emotet?

38
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.790 
In regard to the actions taken by this
malware, emotet could not be

39
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.180 
specifically classified. So in the way it

40
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.980 
gets started is virus, but in
its action it has many

41
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.300 
components from different
types of malware.

42
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.580 
It serves as a staging malware and
will thus be used by deliver

43
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.010 
further kinds of malware to
the target system. So

44
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.110 
part of this infection is to install
more and more other malware component,

45
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.860 
and this could vary from trojans,
ransomware, scareware, keylogger,.

46
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.640 
So emoete is
able to to

47
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.920 
work with all these components,
take care to get this component.

48
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.830 
And this makes it so dangerous
compared to usual spam email,

49
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.390 
because emotet spam emails are
dangerous because they appear

50
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.710 
to be very very
realistic. So the

51
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.480 
cybercriminals take
care that it's not

52
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.630 
immediately detected as a spam
email, it looks very realistic.

53
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:40.140 
Then after the infection, emotet collects
data from the user's email account,

54
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.070 
the contacts with whom the user
communicates, the content which

55
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.160 
are the current the user is
discussing, is communicating about,

56
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.780 
this can be received from the
email subject, from the email contents,

57
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.700 
and from the data from
that collected data.

58
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
Then the user an information is
sent, the spam email is created

59
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.910 
to the user that emotet
then uses such kind of

60
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.810 
detailed information

61
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.330 
to send further emails, like
in the sphere of phishing from

62
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.320 
the infected email accounts to
other users, for example emotet

63
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.640 
gets the information here out of
the contact list of the email

64
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.080 
with whom the user is contacting,
so the next user

65
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.040 
gets exactly with this
background information

66
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:50.010 
an infected email from a trusted email \
and he opens

67
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.370 
the attached document or follows a
link, then although this system of this

68
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.320 
neighbor is infected.

69
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.820 
The spam emails from the emotet therefore
look very realistic, so many people

70
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.970 
trust it because in this way it is
prepared to know specific information

71
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.100 
which people think no one else
could know only my colleague or

72
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.240 
my family member.
So here are

73
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.730 
some examples
of emotet.

74
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.650 
There is the hijacked users
email account,

75
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.300 
this is used as
sender of the email.

76
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.260 
So someone is spoofing you, remember
this is an attack method

77
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.850 
to work with such a
stored sender address,

78
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.450 
in that case when the email
system of a user is

79
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.570 
spied out, his or her email
address is used to send

80
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.230 
the infected email to another user
who is in contact with

81
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.930 
this user which
is already

82
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.410 
infected. Then the subject of the
previous email, so although this

83
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.330 
looks very trustworthy, no one else
would know that the mail was sent

84
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.420 
here in that case
some

85
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.660 
things that need to
be done in HPI. Then

86
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.520 
most important for the attackers,
the malicious link.

87
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.040 
The malicious link to open
something, to open the attached

88
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.040 
document or to get a special information,
and in the moment the user

89
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.720 
follows this links, this is
the actions that needed

90
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.970 
to get infected. Then here there is email
signature from the hijacked user,

91
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.770 
also this looks very realistic,
and then comes the content

92
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.150 
from previous messages in
the conversations those people

93
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.370 
thinks that is a new message and
it's a real message it's not

94
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.270 
detected that is a message
from the attacker.

95
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.710 
Here are some other emotet

96
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:21.580 
examples, so Amazon order, or
something from DHL, a message

97
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.570 
which says we
deliver you

98
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.930 
this and there is a link,
the malicious link

99
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.810 
which leads to the infection of the
system .Or here are all information,

100
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.530 
there are sender
numbers and the links,

101
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.920 
all of the buttons, if these
are used, if the links

102
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:52.610 
are activated then all these are
links in the emotet mails

103
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.490 
which

104
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.540 
lead to the malicious
target and

105
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.110 
cause the infection of the system.

106
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.960 
So it's very realistic, so
people follow this, people

107
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.200 
click this link and then
also their system is

108
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.550 
infected, so this makes
emotet so dangerous.

109
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.910 
How you can recognise
such a phishing email?

110
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:31.070 
You should be very careful, you
should be suspicious of mails

111
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.520 
that you do not expect.

112
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.240 
Then if there is a
personal salutation,

113
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:46.580 
missing so it's only starts the mail
with "Hello" or "Dear customer",

114
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.770 
this could be a hint that this
is not coming from a claimed

115
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.280 
sender and it is an infected message.

116
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.390 
Or wrong languages languages,
for example you use Amazon that's

117
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.810 
English but the received email is
in German language because the

118
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:17.610 
attacker put together the pieces they
got from the former emails and

119
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.330 
how they want to

120
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.630 
design their mail as something
as an order for amazon authors.

121
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.950 
Then typos, typos or wrong
information, misinformations,

122
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.380 
these are

123
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.810 
typical things in such a
phishing mail, if it's

124
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.900 
not correctly designed.

125
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.010 
Or another way you can detect
this phishing email is the

126
00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:00.690 
parent sender address is not consistent
with the real technical sender.

127
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.510 
So it is possible with an
email that there is a field

128
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.090 
that misses sendr address,
but you can see that

129
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:19.390 
this is a only fake, because behind you
can also see the real sender address

130
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.530 
Then strange link targets, this is

131
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.060 
eventually the
most obvious

132
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.690 
point which helps you to detect
that this is an emotet phishing

133
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.390 
email and not
a real one.

134
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.730 
When you move the
pointer over a link,

135
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:46.410 
over an image button in the
email and wait for the tooltip,

136
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:54.530 
when the tooltip appears it
will contain the real link target.

137
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.180 
And if you see there is a difference
between the real link target and

138
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.040 
the displayed link, then
definitely you should not click

139
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.410 
because this
is the most

140
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.880 
obvious way
that this is a

141
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.960 
spam mail, phishing mail from an
attacker and not the real one.

142
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.110 
So i repeat move with
your mouse to the

143
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.260 
link and wait and then
the tooltip shows you

144
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.250 
the real link which is

145
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:38.410 
integrated in the document. And if there's
a difference between

146
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.540 
the real link which is implemented
in the document and the

147
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.020 
shown link then you can be
sure that is an attack

148
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:57.810 
email, the cybercriminals want to force
you to click and to get infected

149
00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.080 
with emotet.

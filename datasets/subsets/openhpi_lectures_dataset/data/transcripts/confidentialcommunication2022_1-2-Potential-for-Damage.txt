00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.680 
In our openHPI course "Confidential
Communication in the Internet",

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.010 
now we want to shortly have a look
to the potential for damage.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.360 
Cybercrime - cybercrime is a
huge problem in the internet,

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.120 
in the world
wide web and

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.540 
I mentioned only a few
of the statistics.

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.190 
There are different studies,
there are different reports.

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.030 
Often it is very difficult to detect such
cybercrime attacks in the internet

8
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.390 
because the people are not aware,
the victims are not aware that

9
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.370 
their data were stolen
or that the data were

10
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.100 
manipulated or that the data were theft.
They are not aware that someone

11
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.610 
uploaded malware on their computer
to get a backdoor or to

12
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.110 
be able to break in. So
Symantec is an important

13
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.190 
security company, a famous company which gives
yearly internet security threat reports.

14
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.660 
And they mentioned that 7.7%

15
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.990 
of web requests lead to malware.
So if you attend the website

16
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.950 
without being aware that malware
is uploaded to your computer.

17
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.470 
55% of all emails
in two thousand seventeen

18
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.670 
were spam. More than half of all
the huge number of emails were

19
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.520 
completely useless
spam mail.

20
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.360 
Cisco also gives annual
cyber security reports.

21
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.520 
And in this report they reported that
53% of the attacks

22
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.240 
resulted in damage of more than
half a million US dollars.

23
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.760 
Other statistics - the statistic reported by
the internet crime compliant center

24
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.630 
accounted three hundred or more than
three hundred thousand attacks

25
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.940 
with a total loss of one almost
one half billion US dollar.

26
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.440 
And you see it
is increasing.

27
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.850 
You see it's not increasing in this
way it's increasing more in that way,

28
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.580 
which depends that the systems
become more and more secure, more

29
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.300 
effective. Anti-virus
programs are installed.

30
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.410 
Other security machinery
were installed in the internet

31
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.300 
but it is a huge
number of

32
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.710 
attacks that every year
happens in the internet.

33
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.870 
Let me mention some
of the very popular

34
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.770 
cyber attacks in
the internet.

35
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.610 
It's only a few but it shows
a great variety of such attacks. So

36
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.180 
in ninety ninety nine
the Melissa virus

37
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.720 
run around the world and it causes
three hundred million damage,

38
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.410 
one hundred fifty thousand
systems were infected

39
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.780 
and they were infected in only four days.
So in a very fast way this virus is

40
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.880 
spread over the internet and
cause a huge amount of damage

41
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.720 
on many many systems.

42
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.410 
And a famous cyber attack in the year
two thousand where the

43
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.890 
ILOVEYOU virus. So the
ILOVEYOU virus caused

44
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.900 
more than ten billion

45
00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.040 
US dollar damage and it was able
to cause this damage within only

46
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.860 
twenty four hours. Half a
million systems were infected.

47
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.720 
In august two
thousand three

48
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.140 
Sobig.F virus.

49
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.950 
It damages companies with

50
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.930 
more than twenty
nine billion

51
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
damage. So there was
shutdowns of entire

52
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.120 
network systems of vendors and
companies. So it was really

53
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.870 
very popular and and in all countries
that discussed cyber attack.

54
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.010 
Another such cyber attack was in October
two thousand nine. It was a a huge

55
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.220 
phishing attack.

56
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.420 
It was a huge phishing attack.
So reports speak of more than

57
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.700 
twenty thousand compromised accounts
from various email providers

58
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.630 
including such famous
providers like Yahoo, AOL,

59
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.610 
Comcast, Earthlink
and Gmail.

60
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:16.690 
Phishing is to send an email that asks
users to do something, to login

61
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.390 
to something or
to send data

62
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.540 
or credential
data or secret data

63
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.120 
in order to repair something
or to provide some help.

64
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:37.500 
So the attacker have many fantasy to convince
the people to do some activity

65
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.330 
that helps them to
collect their data.

66
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.200 
tAnother attack was in June two
thousand ten. It was a stuxnet

67
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.290 
attack this was an APT.
APTs are the most

68
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.690 
the most dangerous attacks, the
advanced persistent attacks.

69
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.210 
The advance persistent
threat attacks

70
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.490 
and with this stuxnet the industrial
software from Siemens was attacked

71
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.990 
in this way the
work of machinery

72
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:22.140 
was infected and with this stuxnet virus the
Iran nuclear factories were infected

73
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.560 
and damage was
was created

74
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.230 
with the idea to slow down
Iran's nuclear program.

75
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.440 
Another attack in June two
thousand, or two other

76
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.040 
famous attacks in June
two thousand eleven.

77
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:48.060 
On one side is a compromise of the
certification authorities DigiNotar

78
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.720 
and Comodo for issuing forged
certificates. In our course we

79
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.940 
speak about certificates. Certificates
are something like passport

80
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.530 
for moving in the
internet and proving

81
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.620 
it's me. And if the hacker, so this
was a real danger, are able

82
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:18.900 
to issue forged certificates, all the
security system breaks down rules.

83
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.160 
LulzSec stole one million records. This was
another attack from two thousand and seven.

84
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.760 
One million records from
sony, user data from sony.

85
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.390 
They attacked the American government
sites and websites of Mastercard

86
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.340 
and Visa.

87
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.400 
Another attack was

88
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.460 
very popular
and discussed

89
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.080 
was from April two
thousand and twelve.

90
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.880 
Gauss-and-flame malware disrupts
computer systems on all platforms

91
00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.940 
in the middle east.
Particularly they were

92
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.420 
acting against the
oil companies.

93
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.400 
So the idea was that
such kind of attack

94
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.280 
also got the support
of some government

95
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:21.740 
governments. September two thousand and
twelve two malware programs appear

96
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.150 
with trusted signatures
from Adobe.

97
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.910 
So it looked like that
the malware came

98
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.290 
as a useful program coming from
adobe because adobe has signed

99
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:38.430 
it, but in reality it was
malware as the people

100
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.330 
that trust adobe installed that
program and in this way they

101
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.240 
installed malware on the system and
opened the door for continued

102
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:54.810 
attacks by the cyber criminals. In June
two thousand thirteen Edward Snowden

103
00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.360 
reveals a huge NSA
surveillance program

104
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.290 
to globally monitor
communication wire the internet.

105
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.520 
So all what was
sent become

106
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.110 
visible and here

107
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:19.170 
exactly what we want to discuss in
our course, how we can prevent

108
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.700 
that even if some messages
became visible and

109
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.390 
got in other hands that the
content becomes not

110
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.820 
possible to access. February two
thousand fifteen Kaspersky reports

111
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.660 
a digital
bank robbery.

112
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.070 
Since two thousand thirteen
one billion US dollars

113
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.870 
have been stolen from hundred banks and
other financial institutions

114
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.660 
by means of such
cyber attacks.

115
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.160 
And it goes on and goes on. In
August two thousand sixteen

116
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.190 
the ShadowBrokers they have
stolen several tools and vulnerability

117
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.490 
information from
NSA's system.

118
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.730 
Vulnerability information of any kind
of software or hardware system in

119
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.880 
the hand of the
hacker helps the to

120
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:23.390 
design exploits, to misuse, to design
strategies for misusing the vulnerabilities

121
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.860 
and this was what the NSA

122
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:35.200 
collected where vulnerabilities that
were not known so called zero-day vulnerability.

123
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.130 
NSA has kept this information
secret because they

124
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.750 
eventually want
to use this

125
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.290 
vulnerability for their own purposes.
And though it was really a

126
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.120 
problem that now a criminal attacker
had this information in the hand.

127
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.220 
In the year two thousand and sixteen
also in november there was an attack

128
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.160 
about one million
routers

129
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.680 
broke due to unsuccessful attacks
by the Mirai botnet. They

130
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.650 
crashed down but this was good that they
crash down, so the people become aware

131
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.510 
of this attack. So it
was unsuccessful.

132
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.620 
So it caused damage to breakdown,
but it was unsuccessful because

133
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.500 
the idea of the hacker was to be able
to steal the data from that routers

134
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.120 
and nobody should
be aware of it.

135
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:39.070 
This Mirai network
included more than half million

136
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.980 
compromised IoT devices.

137
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:49.790 
And in most cases because this IoT
devices were lazily installed.

138
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:58.860 
The devices didn't configure
as the default data

139
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.500 
when the system was delivered, it was
not updated and other problems.

140
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:11.350 
And may two thousand seventeen I
want to mention the WannaCry

141
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.740 
ransomware.

142
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.740 
The WannaCry ransomware which infected
two hundred thirty thousand

143
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.630 
computers in one hundred
fifty countries worldwide

144
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:29.900 
and the idea of the malware, of this
ransomware is to encrypt

145
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:35.550 
the data on the computers, on
the devices of the victims

146
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:42.910 
and then to offer to decrypt the data
when the victims pay money to them.

147
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.250 
It's not clear
whether they

148
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:52.150 
can trust. So many people paid a lot
and the data where not decrypted.

149
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.730 
In other cases the attackers
decrypt the data

150
00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.100 
to make it readable for the people
after getting the money. So

151
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.780 
all this are
attacks in the internet.

152
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.830 
In the last years two
thousand eighteen, there was

153
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.670 
an example of a famous
journalist Jeff Bezos

154
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.430 
and there was a
hack of Jeff Bezos' telephone.

155
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.000 
He was an

156
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:32.020 
interested target because the owner
of Amazon and Washington Post,

157
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.120 
so of course
this person

158
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.650 
has a lot of information, a lot of
activities. So what the hackers

159
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.790 
want to get, they want to get
access to all his communication.

160
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.970 
So the hack most probably was
through a whatsapp video which

161
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.510 
received from a Saudi Crown prince
on the smartphone from Jeff Bezos.

162
00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:01.070 
So it was a big scandal and
discussion that even such person

163
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.210 
are victims
and are not,

164
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.790 
are victims of cyber attacks
and are not able to secure

165
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.130 
themselves in the
right way.

166
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.390 
From this year two thousand
twenty the project Rubicon, a

167
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.110 
Swiss company sold encryption
devices to several governments

168
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:32.370 
and it afterward was found out
that the encryption could be broken

169
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:39.430 
due to a backdoor that was installed
in the tast of the CIA

170
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:45.620 
or in combination
with BND and this

171
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:53.650 
agreement went back until to the
nineteenth last century. So this

172
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.730 
encryption
software which was

173
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.140 
bought by many companies and
which was considered to have a

174
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:09.010 
tool, a powerful tool to secure
information was insecure by

175
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.650 
this back door. So you see there
is damage over damage. These were

176
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.380 
what I mentioned were only
few very popular examples.

177
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:26.500 
In any case what I want to do with
this is to sensitize you to see

178
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.850 
there is a lot of problems and when
we speak in our course about

179
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.410 
confidential communication, it should be
a motivation that some of this hacks

180
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:42.490 
would not be possible if the data
are encrypted in the right way,

181
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.930 
if the confidentiality
is provided.

182
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.810 
But this is only one aspect. There
are many different aspects

183
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.430 
and we will consider
them in later courses.

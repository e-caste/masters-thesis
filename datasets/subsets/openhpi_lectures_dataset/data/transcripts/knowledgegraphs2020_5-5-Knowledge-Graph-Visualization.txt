00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.430 
This is knowledge graphs lecture
five knowledge graph applications.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.600 
In this lecture we are going to see
knowledge graph visualization.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070 
So this pyramid you have seen before
also in some of the lectures.

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.050 
So what we want to do here is we want
to turn our data into knowledge.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.300 
So what do we do for that? So we
look into data and knowledge

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.920 
mining. What are the steps that
we follow for this? So how do

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.850 
we transform data into knowledge?
So the first step for doing so

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.530 
is to collect the data

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.510 
and after you have collected the data
you organize it and analyze it

10
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.500 
which is then converted into the
knowledge. So in order to organize

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.550 
and analyze this data we do it
with the help of visualization.

12
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.030 
Now we have one surprise for the
visualization and explanation of that.

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.540 
Hello and thanks for
being here. So

14
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.250 
look at this interesting example
of infographics. Actually this

15
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
is one of the very first
infographics in history.

16
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.950 
Infographics as you might know
is a really really important

17
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.240 
means of information visualization and to
make data more accessible and to let

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.540 
data to become
knowledge finally.

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.400 
So let's have a look at that?
What do you think is it?

20
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.600 
I'll tell you. It's a kind of map and
this map was drawn by Charles Joseph

21
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.740 
Milard and this guy was living you're
in the nineteenth century and

22
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.470 
in the beginning of the nineteenth
century this was the high

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.340 
time of Napoleon Bonaparte and
people thought this guy you know

24
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.030 
this emperor of France was one
of the most powerful people

25
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.840 
of Europe and of the entire world
and they always wondered why

26
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
he declined in the end and why there
was a fall a downfall of that

27
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.950 
mighty person. So you must imagine
he wanted to go to Russia

28
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.540 
which means he wanted to conquer
Russia with one of the largest

29
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.210 
armies that the world has ever
seen. So almost a million people.

30
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.420 
And the point is from that day on you know
his star was really on the decline.

31
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.290 
So his star was falling
and people were asking

32
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.600 
why was that the case, because
from that Russian campaign only

33
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.760 
a few handful of people came back.
So really really many people died.

34
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.740 
So what this guy Joseph Minard
did was he tried to make

35
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.830 
sense of the data that he
had about that campaign.

36
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.680 
Yyou see here a map. You see on
the left side you have west on

37
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.790 
the right side you have east. On
the west you have the starting

38
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.320 
point there is a river and this is
the starting point of Napoleon's

39
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.760 
campaign and here he starts with
all of his people and of course

40
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.980 
the number of people here is indicated
in the brown line by the width

41
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.080 
of the line.

42
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.960 
And you see while going towards
east and there is battle after

43
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.440 
battle of course. This becomes
smaller and smaller until

44
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.550 
the army reaches
Moscow.

45
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.630 
In Moscow of course there was
the problem that now came the

46
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.240 
Russian winter and winter was rather
strict. So Napoleon decided

47
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.110 
to retreat and to go back. And
you see that the retreat here

48
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.810 
and it's driven or painted in
black and of course in the end

49
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.870 
only the really
really thin line

50
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.040 
occurs and goes out
of that campaign.

51
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.380 
Another kind of data that the guy
also combined with the geographical

52
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.040 
data was for example

53
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.890 
the temperature. Below the map
you see another layer and there

54
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.890 
you see a line drawn and this is the
temperature and while going from the east

55
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.110 
back to the west you see that the
temperature drops dramatically.

56
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.090 
So the winter was really really getting
cold below minus twenty degrees

57
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.810 
and this is really really cold and
therefore because of the hard winter

58
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.940 
many of the remaining people died in
the army. So this is the way how

59
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.140 
people tried to make sense of data. So
data visualization really is worthwhile.

60
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.110 
Thank you for this explanation. So
you can see here that pictures

61
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.720 
speaks a thousand
words.

62
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.330 
So here you can actually see
that picture have been used to

63
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.740 
convey the information long
before any writing, any written

64
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.480 
language came into play. So a
single picture can be processed

65
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.450 
much faster as compared to a tax
page. So when a human looks

66
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.820 
at the picture it is much faster for
him to process this information

67
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.500 
as compared to text. So human a perception
is actually processing in parallel.

68
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.690 
However text analysis is usually limited
to a sequential process of reading.

69
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.290 
So how do we do the information
visualization? So information

70
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.310 
visualization is the
study of interactive

71
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.420 
visual representations
of the abstract data

72
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.090 
to help in the human cognition.
then for which we use information

73
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.800 
graphics or infographics. These are
the graphic and graphical visual

74
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.440 
representation of the information
data or knowledge intended to

75
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.800 
present information really
quickly and clearly.

76
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.390 
So there are static forms of information
visualization which aims at

77
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.880 
emphasizing specific findings which are gained
with the help of these visualization.

78
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.640 
and the and they are actually built
with the aim of data analysis.

79
00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.700 
So now let's take an example of a
quick example of visualization.

80
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.670 
So let's try a SPARQL query on the
wiki data where we are looking for

81
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.010 
number of scientists per country.
So what we want to actually do

82
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.470 
that we want to draw a map chart
of these Scientists by country.

83
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.510 
So you can actually create
these charts with the help

84
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.090 
of the google doc also.

85
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.250 
So now let's try to first start
by writing the query which

86
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.030 
accesses this data
on wikidata.

87
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.970 
So we have a country and number
of scientists per country. This

88
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.990 
is the information that we want from the
SPARQL query. So we have scientists

89
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.540 
which we are looking at, so we
have this variable of scientists

90
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.930 
where we are
looking for

91
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.580 
somebody who has an
occupation scientist.

92
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.720 
Scientists should have a birth
place, some birth place,

93
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.820 
and then birthplace
should be a country

94
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.980 
and we group them by country
because we are looking for number

95
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.930 
of scientists
per country

96
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.670 
and then we count distinct numbers
of scientists. So they will

97
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.580 
occur only once in
counting procedure.

98
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.140 
So in order to get this information
we can run the SPARQL

99
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.410 
query on the SPARQL end point
here. So we should be able to

100
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.690 
get the results soon for
this SPARQL query.

101
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.650 
So actually what is happening it
is the same query and we just

102
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.080 
add the select clause with country
label and scientists. So

103
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.940 
here you can see that it is ordered
by the number of scientists in

104
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.390 
per country. So russia has like
six hundred six thousand six

105
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.700 
hundred and
seventy nine.

106
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.870 
So now the point is the
prerequisite just I will

107
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.520 
before this I will just mention one
thing that here you see the results

108
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.460 
in this snapshot as Russia has
eight thousand eight hundred

109
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.180 
and sixty nine. So this kind
of data changes on wikidata

110
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.220 
very frequently. So probably if
you run this query on your own

111
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.530 
when you see this lecture then if you are going
to get a little bit different statistics.

112
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.130 
So the prerequisite for data
analysis for visualization is

113
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.250 
that we want to perform
data cleaning.

114
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:40.310 
So it is very necessary for that,
so what it requires is the manual

115
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.820 
assessment and the deeper data
analysis and this data analysis

116
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.510 
is an alternative
procedure.

117
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:53.840 
Now in our scientist example we are looking
for birthplaces of historic persons

118
00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:00.260 
where sometimes it can happen
that the birthplaces

119
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.470 
of historic person would be some
historic countries and it

120
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.910 
can also happen that historic countries
might be replaced by other country.

121
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.620 
Now the point is how do you want to
find currently existing countries?

122
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.200 
So this way you refine the search
that you did previously and

123
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.970 
you try to write
another query.

124
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.900 
So here I run the same query
the different query of

125
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.250 
course, I will show you
the query after this.

126
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.150 
And then you obtain some
answers. So you have

127
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.360 
again six thousand six hundred and
seventy nine scientist from Russia

128
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:43.410 
and then it is a ordered by the
number of scientists they have.

129
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.180 
Now let's have a look at the query.
So here you can actually see

130
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.650 
that we are looking at
this, so here we are

131
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.050 
extracting the country label and
the count is done as as before.

132
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:04.110 
And then we are applying these
filters like in this one in

133
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.750 
first filter we say that this is
not that the country is not

134
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.950 
replaced by another country, the
second filter says that it

135
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.020 
is not followed by another
country and it also in the

136
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.680 
third filter it is specifying that
the country has not been dissolved.

137
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.810 
So based on these restrictions
than we were getting this

138
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.650 
answers that you
just saw before.

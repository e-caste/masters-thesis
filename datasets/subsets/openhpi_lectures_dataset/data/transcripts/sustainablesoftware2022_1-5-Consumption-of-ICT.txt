00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.160 
In this video we have a look at the consumption of digitalisation.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.640 
More precise of the technology behind it, the information and communication technology

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.280 
in short ICT.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.500 
And you can say that basically everything you do with ICT causes some kind

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.580 
of emissions. It's not always obvious, and the emissions are not always caused

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.310 
where you think they are caused. Most often they are caused

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.860 
at another place, for instance when you open a website,

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.480 
the main part of the

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.570 
emissions are not caused on your notebook, they are caused in

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.840 
the data centers where the infrastructure of the ICT is operated.

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.260 
Let's start with some simple examples

12
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.030 
of our everyday life. For instance when you take an email of

13
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.540 
one megabyte of size,

14
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.920 
this is equivalent to about twenty grams of CO2.

15
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.280 
If you write twenty emails every day throughout the year this is equivalent

16
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.430 
to a car travelling one thousand kilometer.

17
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.000 
So it's accumulating to quite a bit of a footprint.

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.510 
Another example is a simple web search which is equivalent

19
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.610 
to about three and a half hours,

20
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
equivalent to about one gram of CO2.

21
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.050 
If you do this and most of us often do this, do several times

22
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.790 
of that a day then it's accumulating to about ten kilograms

23
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.110 
of CO2 per year. So even a little of the first side light weight

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.110 
digital processes can accumulate to a quite a bit of a CO2 footprint.

25
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.900 
The average per person

26
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.270 
and the footprint that

27
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.150 
every one of us is causing using ICT

28
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.120 
is equivalent to about one and a half thousand driven kilometers by car.

29
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.010 
Which is quite a lot in total.

30
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.350 
Let's go from this personal perspective to a global perspective.

31
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.820 
When looking at the electricity demand, ICT

32
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.830 
causes somewhere between one and ten percent of

33
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.210 
the global electricity demand.

34
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.930 
Why there is so much distance between one and ten? Its just because different studies

35
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.920 
have different assumptions and then also different results. So,

36
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.330 
let's take here the middle of about five percent, which is

37
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.170 
quite a good rule of thumb.

38
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.160 
Going to the CO2 emissions, you can say that ICT

39
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.730 
is causing about two percent of the global CO2 emissions

40
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.230 
and this is equivalent to the aviation industry.

41
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.820 
This is the status quo. This is today. Let's look at the forecast.

42
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.770 
In the near future it's estimated that data centers as the heart of ICT

43
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.400 
could consume up to twenty eight percent of the total energy consumption

44
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.290 
on a global level. In the best case, it's four percent. Estimated case eleven percent.

45
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.840 
But the worst case is almost a third of the global energy consumption.

46
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.340 
Going again to the CO2 footprint, it's about twenty three percent.

47
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.880 
In the worst case that is cost of CO2 by the ICT.

48
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.980 
So even the numbers of today look quite small,

49
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.960 
the future is looks different. All the numbers are going up

50
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
and in the next slides we will see

51
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.750 
visually how these numbers are increasing a lot.

52
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.760 
In this study for instance, you can see that all the cases, the best,

53
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.500 
the estimated and the worst case, all the graphs are going up. Sometimes very much.

54
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.430 
So you can see that energy consumption is today

55
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.170 
maybe not too much, but in the near future it will increase a lot.

56
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.660 
Same goes if you look at the energy forecast and if you try

57
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.140 
to separate the different share within ICT.

58
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.220 
And you see that also here everything is increasing, especially the

59
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.050 
data center part which is the green area here.

60
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.160 
And even more the blue area, the networks - wireless and wired networks.

61
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.540 
When you look at the internet traffic, so we stay on the network side,

62
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.620 
then you can see that this increased in the past quite a lot

63
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.010 
and the future looks very similarly in the predictions. While

64
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.260 
in 2007, we had about fifty exabytes of total internet traffic,

65
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.190 
just one decade later it increased already in several magnitudes in size

66
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.980 
until today and the predicted future is

67
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.920 
probably following the same trend.

68
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.680 
Talking about the life cycle, where the consumption is caused

69
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.560 
in the life cycle on products,

70
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.910 
we see that there is half of the consumption caused in the production

71
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.340 
and the other half in the used time of the products.

72
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.470 
You remember the example of the e-book for instance.

73
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.450 
And we see a trend here that in the usage time that this fifty percent is actually

74
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.890 
a little bit taking over and increasing.

75
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.350 
So there's potential here to reduce this

76
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.930 
consumption side, so when we do sustainable software engineering, we have exactly

77
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.010 
some influence on this side of the consumption cake.

78
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.930 
Let's look more in the heart of the ICT,

79
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.450 
data centers. And if you look there at the different shares

80
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.080 
of components that cause consumption, then you can see that there is three

81
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.760 
that are especially significant

82
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.570 
for the effect of consumption. And you can see that especially

83
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.550 
servers, storage and air conditioning have the highest share

84
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.210 
in the consumption in data centers. All of them increasing.

85
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.760 
When you look for solutions,

86
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.100 
try to reduce the consumption, then one of the

87
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.280 
most significant strategy is to look at the energy supply of data centers.

88
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.030 
When you look on a national level of Germany, the renewable energy

89
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.970 
in energy production is about fifty percent in the share.

90
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.510 
The data centers still have potential to take this level on themselves and

91
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.130 
to increase the share. So even the bigger hyperscale as of today

92
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.160 
are not at one hundred percent. It's their target but we should see in the

93
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:28.340 
near future some higher rates in supplying the data

94
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.500 
centers with renewable energy. And with this strategy, you already

95
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.930 
face and mitigate quite a bit of consumption because data center as we saw

96
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:45.550 
could cost up to thirty percent, in the worse case, of the total global energy demand

97
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.630 
in the near future.

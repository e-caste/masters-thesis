00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.990 
hi i'm Anjali Singh, a phd student at the university of michigan.

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.490 
i will be presenting our paper on the effects of learner sourcing

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.980 
questions in a MOOC. this work was done with my collaborators

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.310 
chris brooks, Yiwen Lin and Warren Li.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.000 
learner sourcing a form of crowdsourcing where learners engage

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.340 
in learning activities while generating useful input for other

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.760 
learners is emerging as a viable approach of skilling up the

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.610 
generation of learning resources.

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.110 
many recent works have shown the effectiveness of learning

10
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.540 
from learner source artifacts such as questions, hints and explanations

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
for the learners who learn from these artifacts.

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.090 
but what about the effects of learner sourcing on the learners

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.850 
who create these artifacts. what's in it for them?

14
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.420 
to address this gap we explored some effects of learner sourcing

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
and the motivations behind engaging in it for students who

16
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.350 
create multiple choice questions or mc q's in a MOOC.

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
as indicated by prior studies question generation encourages

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.610 
the development of higher order thinking skills in learners

19
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.910 
and hence is a suitable learner sourcing task.

20
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.560 
a design consideration in learner sourcing is whether
it is required or optional

21
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.140 
option learner sourcing can lead to very low participation,

22
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.440 
on the other hand required learner sourcing can lead to lower

23
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.070 
quality output and even student disengagement to our knowledge

24
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.040 
there is no prior study comparing the benefits and drawbacks

25
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.130 
of each approach which is another gap we address in this work.

26
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.230 
overall from a student centric perspective.

27
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.700 
the goals of designing learner sourcing tasks should be such

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.670 
that students learn deeply and find value in engaging with the task.

29
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.580 
from the instructor's perspective it would also be great to

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.950 
have high quality output

31
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.580 
through our first research question we tried to understand

32
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.870 
whether optional or required learner sourcing was better in

33
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.320 
the context of MOOCs for learners such that the value of the

34
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.630 
task and found it worth expending the effort as well as for

35
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.470 
collecting high quality questions.

36
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.190 
the second research question focused on the voluntary setting
of learner sourcing

37
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.510 
to explain why or why not learners may want to engage in such tasks.

38
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.660 
since the effects of question generation have been studied

39
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.860 
mostly in on-campus classrooms throughout the third research

40
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.140 
question we explored whether these effects persist in MOOCs

41
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.160 
and also looked at the differences in the learning outcomes,

42
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.330 
when learner sourcing is required versus when it is optional.

43
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.330 
to answer these questions we conducted three an experiment

44
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.890 
on the coursera mooc introduction to data science invited as

45
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.190 
a small incentive to encourage learners to create good mc q's

46
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.630 
we included this task as part of two of the mooc quizzes which

47
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.470 
were worth a small portion of the total points needed to pass

48
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.960 
the course and get certified.

49
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.730 
in the control condition which had no action generation task

50
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.810 
learners got ten mc q's to answer.

51
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.430 
learners in the create condition got six mc q's to answer and

52
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.930 
one question generation task.

53
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.170 
learners in the choice condition got six mc q's to answer and

54
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.250 
the choice between answering four more mc q's and creating one empty q

55
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.170 
both choice and create conditions also included surveys after each quiz

56
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.840 
with questions related to students' experience of creating an excuse.

57
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.540 
to summarize the experiment was conducted by a two of the mooc

58
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.240 
quizzes the format for which varied with the experimental conditions.

59
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.710 
the final quiz which was a summative assessment was used for

60
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.340 
assessing learners' understanding of the course concepts.

61
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.500 
while the empty q's that students answered were automatically evaluated

62
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.960 
the evaluation of the student generated execute was done by

63
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.570 
a team of graduate students proficient in the course curriculum who

64
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.340 
followed a grading rubric specifically developed
for our question generation task.

65
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
we found that learners who chose to create questions created

66
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.990 
higher quality questions than those who were required to do so.

67
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.950 
we qualitatively coded a sample of questions from the choice

68
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.300 
and create conditions to seven levels which range from one

69
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.210 
hundred percent correct higher order thinking mcq to invalid questions.

70
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.210 
our evaluation showed that learners who chose to create questions

71
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.300 
created more high quality questions than learners who were

72
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.370 
not given a choice.

73
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.630 
we also found that learners who chose to create a question

74
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.970 
had higher perceived value of creating questions than learners

75
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.250 
who were required to do so.

76
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.690 
this plot visualizes the agreement of learners with high value

77
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.520 
of creating mc q's showing stronger agreement for learners

78
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.150 
who got a choice in module two.

79
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.120 
the same result was also observed in module three.

80
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.560 
in terms of the perceived effort of mcq generation we did not

81
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.470 
find any significant difference between learners who did or

82
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.710 
did not get a choice.

83
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.410 
next we analyzed the factors that learners in the choice condition

84
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.430 
mentioned as influential in the choice to create a question.

85
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.720 
we found interest in creating an empty q and willingness to

86
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.260 
contribute to future learners as top factors behind their choice.

87
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.870 
here we have some open-ended responses from learners where

88
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.910 
one learner expressed that they found mcq generation to be a unique task.

89
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.810 
another learner expressed a willingness to challenge themselves

90
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.310 
by engaging in the task. and several learners mentioned that

91
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.930 
they learned deeply in the process of creating an insecure.

92
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.290 
the top factors that influenced learners' decision to not create an insecure

93
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.830 
were higher perceived competence of answering mc ques as well

94
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.590 
as more familiarity more interest and lower perceived effort

95
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.560 
in answering mc ques. in the open and observing responses some

96
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
learners mentioned choosing not to create an empty queue as

97
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.670 
they were not proficient in english. time constraints and the

98
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.210 
opportunity cost of not getting four more mc ques to answer

99
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.720 
were also concerns expressed by some learners.

100
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.790 
in terms of the learning outcomes and retention for students

101
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.230 
in the different conditions we did not find any significant difference.

102
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.710 
overall this work contributes to an understanding of better

103
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.530 
designing learner source tasks particularly from
a student centric perspective.

104
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.580 
we found that giving students a choice in learner sourcing

105
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.900 
led to high quality output and also higher perceived value

106
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.910 
thus making it a viable personalised learning activity for mooc learners.

107
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.020 
the evaluation workload was also significantly reduced since

108
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.570 
only around ten percent of the learners chose to create an

109
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.280 
mcq. but we still collected many questions given the large number

110
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.540 
of learners in the mooc.

111
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.090 
in the future we would like to explore the generalizability

112
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.590 
of these insights to other learner sourcing tasks and contexts

113
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.330 
to better understand how we can improve the design
of learner sourcing tasks.

114
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.320 
in this regard future research should also explore how to care

115
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.410 
for students as they engage in learner sourcing to promote

116
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.840 
deeper learning as well as the generation of high-quality output.

117
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.730 
thank you all for listening. and please check out our paper

118
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.650 
for more details of the experiment and the implications for

119
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.880 
designing learner sourcing tasks. and please feel free to reach

120
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.120 
out for any questions. thank you.

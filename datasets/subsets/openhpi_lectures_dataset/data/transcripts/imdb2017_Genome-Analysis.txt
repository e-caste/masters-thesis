1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.700 
We build such a kind of single
source of truth where we use

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.120 
the in-memory database technology
to put in various data sources,

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.140 
heterogenous data sources, we
heard that in a discussion.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.170 
They have different formats,
they are not standardized

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.200 
but we don't care about that
because we can do flexible data

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.230 
transformation directly with
the help of a memory technology

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.260 
so we load the data as it is,
do the transformation when it

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.280 
is needed, for instance
when you do some queries.

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.320 
You see we have here
only small subset of data

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.350 
which is currently in
our systems, genome data,

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.390 
biological pathways which
are typically par structured

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.420 
graph structure, we have
publications so un-structured

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.460 
text documents and a lot
of more. The challenge here

14
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
is today, if you use traditional
technologies which are available

15
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.520 
you can build something similar
but you need to have different

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.570 
databases like one optimized
for graph data processing, one

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.600 
optimised for analysis maybe
and another one which is good in

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.620 
storing big data
amounts right.

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.670 
On top you see we created
together with students

20
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.710 
different extensions which
are not a traditional

21
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.740 
component of that in memory
technology. Very specific for that

22
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.790 
medical data processing like
having specific analysis

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.820 
which are more
or less optimized

24
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
for the medical use case.
We have certain aspects like

25
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
access control. We
just talked about the

26
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.930 
data privacy issues and of
course aspects like building,

27
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.950 
like having an app store
where you can extend

28
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.990 
the existing functionality, build
your own apps combined services.

29
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.103 
You see how it might look like,
so all around you have that

30
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:47.107 
small lead interfaces where
you can attach applications.

31
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.110 
Obviously you can build
cloud applications using your

32
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.114 
browser, you can
use that javascript

33
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:58.118 
API where you can use
restful service queries

34
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.121 
and you can get your
results. It's like you are

35
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.125 
used from different big
social media networks in the

36
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.128 
in the internet google or
facebook where you can use them.

37
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.131 
I'd like to give you a short
introduction about two selected

38
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.135 
prototypes we created
here. One is the medical

39
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.138 
knowledge cockpit, basically the
idea here is exactly to support

40
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:23.143 
researchers in oncology to bring
in all relevant information,

41
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:27.147 
which is obviously together
available worldwide on the internet,

42
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.150 
to bring them a selected result
set where they have a look

43
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.153 
at, not to create new knowledge
but to give them pointers where

44
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.156 
they have a good idea to start,
for instance reading or to

45
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.159 
get some details about the
patient. How this might look

46
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.164 
like, I just switch to the
browser. How does it look like? You

47
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.166 
can you can use
it as a tool.

48
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:51.171 
What you see here is
basically the entry screen,

49
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.174 
you see on the top right
the details about a

50
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.177 
patient which is anonymized.
This is Jane Doe, Jane Doe is

51
00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:01.181 
based on a real patient and
information on the right top I

52
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.184 
extracted from the her clinical
documents, from the anamnesis,

53
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:08.188 
from the doctors letter, from
the results, from the laboratory.

54
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:12.192 
However this is already
a kind of text mining,

55
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.195 
you have a complex process and
before you get this tiny screen

56
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.198 
on the right inside,
right. What you see here

57
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.201 
we are able to extract information
like she's female, she's 49

58
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:25.205 
years, so the birthday
was detected. Of course

59
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.208 
she is non-smoker and
she was diagnosed with

60
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:32.212 
a lung cancer diagnosis, that's
a problem. She never smoked,

61
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.215 
she is not living in
household where someone smokes

62
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.217 
however she was
diagnosed non-small cell

63
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:41.221 
lung cancer and you see stage
four which is a progressive

64
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.223 
state. That means
she has a crucial

65
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:48.228 
interest in removing
this tumor. Additional

66
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:51.231 
information here,
you see since we are

67
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.234 
she was at hospital,
in Charité hospital

68
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.237 
they already did some genome
analysis. There are different

69
00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.240 
kinds of quality or different
kinds of details. They

70
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.243 
did only the standard way,
they have some panel sequencing

71
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.246 
set up here and came up
with some bio-markers

72
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.248 
which might be relevant
for the tumor disease

73
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:12.252 
like you see them here. The
problem now for the clinician

74
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:16.256 
is, ok these are maybe known
oncogenes for this kind of

75
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.259 
disease but how are they
related. What they can do, they

76
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.262 
can click on the individual terms
here and you see in the moment

77
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:26.266 
I click here, some flicker
occurs here but in the

78
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.269 
end you see different results
from different data sources.

79
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.272 
For instance on the left
hand side you see from cancer

80
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.274 
gene census which is a
Sanger (institute) database.

81
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.277 
You see some details, selected
details about the genes like

82
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:41.281 
a KRAS is correlated or is
known to be connected to lung

83
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:45.285 
cancer tumors. You see here, non small
cell lung cancer the abbreviation

84
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.287 
is also connected
to EGFR and so on.

85
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.290 
On the right-hand side you
see we have heard about

86
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.294 
the publications, you see links
to literature, latest publications

87
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:59.299 
dealing with these
individual genes maybe and in

88
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.302 
addition information which
are relevant for the patient.

89
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.304 
For instances she is female,
she is in the age between

90
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:08.308 
40 and 60 and so on.
It's not the whole set of

91
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.311 
text which is available on the
internet, it's more or less already

92
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.314 
evaluated so they
pop up here on the

93
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.317 
top. What you see if you
click here, you get a lot of

94
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.320 
more literature, but
however this is only the

95
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.324 
like you know from google,
the first page hits are the

96
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.327 
more interesting ones
like the ones on page

97
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.330 
40 or whatever. In addition
what you also see is

98
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.334 
the definitions about the genes,
why are they important, what

99
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:39.339 
are they important for. Here
you see also clinical trials

100
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.342 
and about the clinical trials
this is very interesting because

101
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.344 
if you have someone who
is not responding to the

102
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.348 
standard therapy
that the chemotherapy

103
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.351 
which has to be applied
following the guidelines, the

104
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.354 
medical guidelines. This was
also the case here, Jane Doe

105
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:58.358 
was treated was the traditional
therapy with Cisplatin

106
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.362 
and the problem
was after the third

107
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:06.366 
cycle day they figured out
it's not attacking only

108
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.369 
the tumor, it's exactly the
comparison, it's a problem

109
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:13.373 
they were not able to fit
it. What they did, they used

110
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.376 
to take off the tumor material and
did some whole genome sequencing,

111
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.378 
the more detail genome
sequencing and they came up

112
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.382 
with another gene which
is not listed on the right

113
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.385 
hand side so you can enter here
free text and the gene names for

114
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.388 
instance. You can also look up
what happens if I add this new

115
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.392 
knowledge and you see
here BB2 is also known to

116
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.393 
be connected to non
small cell lung cancer.

117
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.398 
Since the standard therapy did
not work, you see here you get

118
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:42.402 
some results about clinical
trials. You get hints about where

119
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.405 
you should look as a doctor and
the problem is about clinical

120
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.409 
trials, they look like this.
It's a lot of unstructured

121
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.413 
text, you can see it's page wise
and the problem is if you want to

122
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:57.417 
keep track with that, as a
doctor you have to follow all new

123
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.419 
clinical trials on the internet
and typically only know about

124
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.423 
trials where your self, your
departmentm maybe your hospital is

125
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:07.427 
participating but not about all
the world wide clinical trials.

126
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.429 
You may be not aware of
everything which is out there.

127
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.432 
What happened here,
thanks to this tool

128
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:17.437 
we can check this up, we
will find where the ERBB2

129
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:23.443 
stuff is. This is here, so
they are looking for patients

130
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.446 
which suffer ERBB2
amplification and they

131
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.448 
will receive a new drug
which is called Lapatinib.

132
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.450 
This is exactly
what happened here,

133
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.453 
they were able to put this
patient into this clinical trial

134
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.456 
because in a standard therapy
they are not allowed to use a

135
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:40.460 
Lapatinib and in the
end the only difficulty

136
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.464 
to solve wars, to find
a sponsor which is on

137
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.466 
the local side because
you see here at the end

138
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.470 
the locations where you can
participate in this clinical trial

139
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.473 
are in Maryland and Oregon.
The patient was from Germany.

140
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.475 
This was easily solved.

141
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.479 
In the end what you can
take home from the third

142
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.483 
demo, you can use these
tools which are kind of

143
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.485 
combining different
data sources

144
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.488 
to help to find the right portion
of information. The problem

145
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:12.492 
today in clinics and hospitals
is that the physicians

146
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.495 
have too much information
where they have to

147
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.498 
get the right piece out
of. So finding the needle

148
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.501 
in the hay stack. The
problem here is also

149
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.504 
to support them, another
project we've done

150
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:29.509 
in the last master project
course is to support

151
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:34.514 
the people in the research
facilities to find a good

152
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:38.518 
knowledge about a
certain therapy. When is

153
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.520 
a certain therapy works for
certain kinds of cancer? What

154
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.522 
you see here, this
is also built on that

155
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.525 
platform. You see a set of
tumors and they are very specific

156
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:49.529 
because they are dealing
was a very rare disease

157
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.531 
which is called head and neck
cancer, everything here in the

158
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:55.535 
upper respiratory system. What
you can see,  these tumors

159
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.538 
were sequenced and
the details of the

160
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.542 
genome sequencing are listed here,
this is more or less for the researcher

161
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.544 
because it's tabular, in
very detail and you see

162
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:09.549 
some of these changes for
instance are responsible for true

163
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.551 
functional changes, that means
they have an impact. We heard

164
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.555 
about the proteomics in the
morning, so they change the products

165
00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.558 
of the cell, they change the
products which are generated for

166
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.560 
the body and they
also affect somehow

167
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.565 
the whole body.
Now the question is

168
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:29.569 
what might be
interesting

169
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.573 
is, is there a correlation
between certain genetic

170
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:38.578 
dispositions and a response to
tumor therapy. Like giving them,

171
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.580 
like in the example giving them
Cisplatin or (another drug).

172
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.584 
Can we predict that a certain
kind of therapy works?

173
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.588 
The problem today
is, as a clinical

174
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.591 
oncologist you have
about ten chemotherapy

175
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:56.596 
alternatives per cancer
kind. If you take one of it

176
00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:00.600 
and apply it to a doctor you
have the problem at least in nine

177
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.603 
out of ten cases you choose
the wrong one, right, or not

178
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.606 
the best one. Now the
challenge is to give

179
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:13.613 
them a kind of a system
tool which can help

180
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.615 
them to find the right
one. What you can do here,

181
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.617 
you can for instance
see here is set of

182
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.620 
chemotherapies which
can be applied, you

183
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.623 
can select some of them like
carboplatine and docetaxel

184
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:27.627 
for instance. You can define
a certain set of data which

185
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.630 
should be correlated to identify
correlate, should be used

186
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.633 
for training of the support
vector machine, machine

187
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.636 
learning algorithm here for
instance. We need to use this

188
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.639 
one and then you see here some
of the experimental data which

189
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:43.643 
is still very research-like.
You see for instance the tumors,

190
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.645 
the values which are conducted
in experiments and you want

191
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.649 
to identify for instance how it
looks like for a certain kind

192
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.651 
of patient. Now we
select one of the

193
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.655 
tumors and want to predict
them as we wouldn't

194
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.657 
have never taken the experiments.
We use the rest for the

195
00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:03.663 
training. What
happens, you can do for

196
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.665 
instance the following,
you can now click

197
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.668 
on run and some
milliseconds

198
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.671 
after preparing the data
and after sending it to the

199
00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.675 
database you get some
results like here.

200
00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.680 
Let's look that, here we have
the substance carboplatin and

201
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.685 
what you see it was
aggregated here as stable

202
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:29.689 
disease and it was mentioned
that the class for using this

203
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.693 
kind of therapy would be
resulting in a stable disease

204
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.696 
of the tumor. You see what
was measured is also stable so

205
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.699 
this is the prediction versus what
we really measured in experiment.

206
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.703 
You see also something like
here, like for docetaxel.

207
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.706 
It's classified as good responders,
so it might be very good

208
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:50.710 
for the tumor and reduce the
tumor and actually it was measured

209
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.714 
as stable. However the accuracy
of these algorithms improves

210
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:59.719 
with the data behind it. Here
the example they were, I used

211
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:03.723 
for that example is
about 10 or 15 patients

212
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.726 
in size. With our partner
we use some 100 patient

213
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.729 
data here and this is more accurate
but the idea is clear, you can

214
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.733 
use statistical tools which out
there, you can modify and see what

215
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.736 
happens if you change a little
bit in the parameters and

216
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.739 
with the help of the memory
technology you can do this

217
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.743 
round by round by round.
You are not limited

218
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.746 
to have a certain kind
of report where you can

219
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.748 
get a result and if you want to
tweak something you have to phone

220
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:32.752 
the IT department. Now is a researcher
you can tweak as long as you

221
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.755 
are interested and you can
identify certain correlations.

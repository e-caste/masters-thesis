Hi, a few words about myself. My name is Mathias. I hold a bachelor's

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.810 
and master's degree in Information Systems,

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.160 
in which I focus on two topics that I am passionate about until today.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.490 
First one data analytics in the context of energy efficiency

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.940 
and the second one open source and all around this topic.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.300 
Based on that I am now working at Frachtwerk as designer of

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.740 
IT architectures with open source technology and also I manage

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.010 
software products in projects where energy efficiency and all around sustainable

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.910 
digitalisation are especially important.

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.810 
In the first part of this course, I will share my experience about

11
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.050 
all the basic concepts and strategies in the context of sustainable software engineering.

12
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.800 
So I'm looking forward to see you in the course.

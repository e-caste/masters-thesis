00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.140 
Ok, Tom. let's continue with the
collaboration tools. So what happens

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.400 
if we have a team of people
working remotely and all of them

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.150 
are working in the same document,
is there any kind of controlling

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.390 
the version that everyone
is writing there?

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.930 
Yes, we have a couple
of tools which are

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.550 
particularly taking
care of this problem.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.760 
but they are called
version control systems

8
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.100 
or source control management
systems and in the second term

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.960 
that we've used here
you can already see

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.100 
where they belong to
particularly a targeting.

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.060 
Its about source code about
code tools but actually you

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.830 
can use them for any
text based content

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.490 
that you have and with
text-based I mean

14
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.580 
plain text, and not rich text,
not words, not office tools

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.720 
by other manufacturers, so
we're really talking about

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.140 
text tools here and I
will go a little bit

17
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.050 
into the details why this is
only a very good solution

18
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.340 
for text-based tools, or
particularly good for

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.030 
text-based tools. So one of
the the main advantages

20
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.900 
is they keep track of the
changes so you know

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.300 
who changed what when and even why
because you can make comments

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.610 
on that because I did this change
because I wanted to achieve

23
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.430 
this and this and so in this
way these serve sort of

24
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.400 
as a backup of a
previous system state.

25
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.180 
So I have a software tool, a huge
project with a thousands of

26
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.040 
lines of code and then somebody
is changing something at

27
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.330 
some point and the whole system
breaks, and then you want

28
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.820 
to have a way to easily go
back to the point with

29
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.580 
you were working, all you have to do
is different changes at the same

30
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.900 
time so you have to
fix a bug or kind of

31
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.920 
also can work on new features and
then you can have different

32
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
branches where you have one branch
where you just are fixing a bug

33
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.730 
while you have another branch,
where somebody else, or the same

34
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.260 
person, is working
on new features.

35
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.760 
And then in the end you can
bring all that stuff together

36
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.390 
and a we have centralised
systems that are doing

37
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.250 
things like then will come to
that later in more detail

38
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.490 
we will be talking about that, and
these are normally the older

39
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.820 
systems so that's where how
it started kind of a couple

40
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.090 
of decades ago already, and
then we have the newer

41
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.590 
systems are mostly
distributed systems.

42
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.760 
as I already said, the main
purpose of these tools is

43
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.160 
to work with text files and
let's look at this example

44
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.410 
So we have on the
top in the upper

45
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.160 
rectangle we have a piece of
text it's just like plain

46
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.660 
lorem ipsum text, the
original one, and then

47
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.600 
we have two users who are
working on that same

48
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.930 
file same text file and user one
is working on the lower part

49
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.440 
of the file replacing the letters
and lorem ipsum with some

50
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.910 
other fantasy language,
and the user two

51
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.760 
is working on the same file but
on the upper part and replacing

52
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.760 
it with a I think that's esperanto
or something like that.

53
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.390 
So we have two versions
of the same file now

54
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.910 
and they are differing
in different parts.

55
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.410 
So what to do now is
we want to bring

56
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.120 
them together without losing
any of the changes that these

57
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.030 
two users made on that file.
And so these tools will

58
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.360 
be automatically detecting.. the upper
part that's fine, first or two

59
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.360 
sentences we don't have
any problem with that

60
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.470 
because there's just this
change but this one user

61
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.640 
and the lower part is also fine,
because there's just this change

62
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.490 
by the other user, but then there's
the part in the middle and

63
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.090 
we have the middle line, we
have changes in the beginning

64
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.310 
by a user two, and in the
end of the of the line

65
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.360 
by user one, so there is some
sort of a conflict here so that

66
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.980 
this doesn't necessarily know
what to do here how to change

67
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.360 
that line and so
it will ask you.

68
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.940 
It will ask me as a user
one or as a user two?

69
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.010 
well actually it will ask the
user who tries to merge

70
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.390 
and that could be either user one or
user two or the project manager or

71
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.480 
the team lead or somebody
completely different

72
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.150 
and that is when different
communication tools should

73
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.010 
come into place because
then you should start

74
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.200 
to be talking about if you don't
really know what you did.

75
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.120 
The tool itself cannot resolve the
problem you need to talk to someone

76
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.210 
else and to say what was the problem.
Exactly the tool can merge

77
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.910 
all the parts that do
not cause problems

78
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.040 
and it can identify the parts
that do cause problems. Ok. And

79
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.010 
then it can ask you to
solve the problem.

80
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.760 
And you should be able to
do that either by asking

81
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.350 
someone else.. user one
or two? or by deciding

82
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.670 
something, as a team lead. Otherwise
this will not be merged?

83
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.940 
or? No, it won't merge
any files because it

84
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.830 
could break the system
so it won't do that

85
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.450 
it will give you kind of this
information you need to do

86
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.480 
something and then you have
to do something. Ok.

87
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.950 
And this is this basically just
doesn't really work with

88
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.090 
binary files or with images,
also with rich text

89
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.440 
files, it doesn't work
that good anymore

90
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.950 
because you have all these kind of
other information around. Is a word

91
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.360 
document a binary file or
a text file? I mean it

92
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.410 
depends on the word
version but the kind

93
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.280 
of the newer versions
use XML as a basis

94
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.290 
so it is actually a text file
but there's so much around

95
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.230 
the actual text that I
mean formatting all that

96
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.950 
stuff that it would get hard to keep
all these changes as plain text.

97
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.630 
So, I wouldn't really
recommend to do word

98
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.100 
files with version
control.

99
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.600 
What you can use is any
kind of source code

100
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.430 
or if you're writing in
Latin for example as

101
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.340 
plain text with formatting as well.
But for developers and researchers

102
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.310 
it is a tool that has
been used? Yeah. Ok.

103
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.850 
So if you have a
look at this slide

104
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.100 
we can see for an image it
really doesn't work that well

105
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.840 
so you have kind of you start
with the eyes and a mouth

106
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.510 
and then there's a one one person
adding some ears and closing

107
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.590 
the eyes and the other one
is kind of adding a nose

108
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.080 
how will you merge
that? I mean it could

109
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.870 
end up looking something
like that the thing at

110
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.310 
the bottom but there's
no kind of like lines

111
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.090 
and there's no real
information in there

112
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.220 
that a tool could use to
handle things like that

113
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.710 
so this is getting difficult. I
believe then this is working

114
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.560 
because we have a central model
distributed model is there any

115
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.610 
difference there? what are the
advantages or disadvantages of

116
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.280 
these model? So I would
say if you start

117
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.020 
right now using such a tool
go for the distributed

118
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.740 
model definitely, because
they are kind of

119
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.790 
newer and they have
lots of advantages.

120
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.180 
Many companies are still using
slightly older tools like

121
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.290 
I think CVS it that's the
oldest of these tools that's

122
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.580 
not so much in use anymore
but SVN I mean it's still

123
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.530 
developed and it's still used by
many companies so if you have

124
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.400 
that already running, think
about if it might be

125
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:09.600 
a good idea worth switching
to a new distributed model,

126
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.670 
or keep the- kind of- stay with.. the
never changed the running system.

127
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.450 
Because that works and if it
works for you stay with

128
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.760 
it that's fine. So the
difference between a

129
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.950 
centralized and distributed
in this case is:

130
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.380 
in a centralized repository
you have this kind of all

131
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.290 
the information about
what happened when

132
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.440 
in the history in the
only in the repository

133
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.450 
that's not on your local machine
normally so on your local

134
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.350 
machine you have a working copy
and in this working copies

135
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.120 
you can track the changes
and can do that what

136
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.900 
you just did but you don't
know what happened

137
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:54.210 
otherwise, and so you need to
be online basically to be

138
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.030 
connected with the central
system to keep this.

139
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.250 
This is very relevant for
people working remotely

140
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.920 
because probably I don't have
internet; if I don't have internet

141
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.270 
that means if I work with a
distributed model I can be working

142
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.070 
offline, and when I have internet
again I will synchronize again

143
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.060 
but it's something different with
the centralized. It means if

144
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.990 
there is no internet then
I have no contact to

145
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.100 
the versioning system. Exactly
so in the distributed

146
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.780 
model you have all these versioning
information on your local

147
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.860 
machine as well, and you need
to see or can see what

148
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.790 
happened before, and then you can
go back and do that. So you have

149
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.020 
way more information
just in this system

150
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.480 
and then definitely at some
point you will need the

151
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.360 
internet to go to a remote
repository particularly if

152
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.970 
you are working in teams together
with them, if you're working

153
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.290 
just on your own you can do
the whole version control

154
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.610 
on your local machine
and you can use that

155
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.660 
as well, but this is not what
we've been taking about. Ok.

156
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:03.070 
So, one of the most famous
and most often used

157
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.860 
tools noways, for version
control that's Git

158
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:13.050 
and Git is such a
distributed tool

159
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.070 
and we have a lot of kind of
we have to set the actual

160
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.400 
tool Git which is doing the
version control but around that

161
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.090 
we have a lot of other tools
that help us to work with

162
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.660 
Git, so we have repository managers
and we have GUI Clients.

163
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.370 
And the repository
managers handle the part

164
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.760 
of the remote repository,
and we saw in the

165
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.390 
last video where we've been talking
about the asynchronous communication

166
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.670 
we saw this forum in the
tool called Git lab

167
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.680 
where you can manage the source
code on the repository or could

168
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.390 
discuss about the changes there
with your team and stuff like

169
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.140 
that and this this is
one of these tools

170
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.790 
one of these repository
managers so they are running

171
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.500 
or showing you what's going on
in the remote and the shared

172
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.450 
repository, and there you
can manage to code you can

173
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.780 
look for a code, you can search
certain things, you can command on

174
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.740 
the code, you can compare things
like different versions

175
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.950 
and actually also contribute.
I believe these tools also

176
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.050 
are the cloud-based or premise based
and as we've seen in the last video.

177
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.570 
As we said with the
video tools, with

178
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.710 
the text chats, also with the
documentation tools and all

179
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.360 
asynchronous tools. For all of
these tools there's always the

180
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.140 
option that you can use a
cloud-based version that you can

181
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.220 
use a free model cloud-based or
you can use a paid model cloud

182
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.490 
or you have the whole stuff running
on your own systems there's

183
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:48.320 
a different kind of a providers
were who are serving these

184
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.810 
different needs and it's kind of
always the same as we already

185
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:58.120 
said, it depends on your privacy
needs, it depends on or on security

186
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.180 
issues, it depends on the price
you want to pay, it depends

187
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.120 
on the setup that
you want to do

188
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.350 
or want to avoid, and all these
stuff, so it's always the

189
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:13.120 
same and then finally we have
the GUI clients and there's

190
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.160 
also a huge amount of
these GUI clients

191
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.720 
and they are to help you kind of
work on your local repository

192
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.930 
so they are just visualizing
things, but actually

193
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.500 
you don't need them because
there's also the the Git command

194
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.620 
line and the real people they
are working on the command

195
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:37.580 
line but it is.. I mean yeah
you don't really.. I mean

196
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.660 
if you're not an expert in that
and not used to doing that

197
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.010 
you don't see what
you're doing there.

198
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.180 
Imagine as you probably
know the matrix movie

199
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.960 
with all these numbers coming
down it's a little similar.Ok.

200
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.090 
Right. Ok, Tom thank you for sharing
that with us I believe I'll

201
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.480 
try.. and in the community we
will have some people having

202
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.860 
already experience with these
kind of tools.. clients or

203
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.140 
repository managers please share
with us, join the discussion.

204
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.510 
We look forward to hear from
you what have been your

205
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.190 
experiences in this kind of tools,
this is more related to, for

206
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.590 
developers and for
researchers but anyway

207
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.380 
we would like to hear from you
please join the discussion.

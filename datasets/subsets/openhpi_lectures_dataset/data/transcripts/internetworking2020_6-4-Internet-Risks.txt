1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.490 
We continue to discuss internet
risks in our openHPI course

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.810 
A Half Century of Internet:
How it Works Today

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.420 
So there is a very serious
rise in computer crime

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.050 
and reason is the commercial use of the
internet which attracts the attackers

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.510 
and attracts criminal
activities

6
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.040 
So, there are some center and
institution that measure such

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.530 
internet crime as the Internet
Crime Complaint Center in US

8
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.130 
counts more than 4.9 million
complaints that have

9
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.780 
been reported
since 2000

10
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.270 
Since the year 2000, more than
1,200 complaints per day

11
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.050 
complaints per
day on average

12
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.610 
Over 340,000 complaints
per years on average

13
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.910 
over the last 5 years. So, you
see it's really a huge problem

14
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.980 
this cybercrime. If we look
for the financial loss then

15
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.200 
more than 3.5 billion
victims losses in the last

16
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.940 
year in 2019

17
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.300 
and when we looked at the
risk of the digital world

18
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.700 
then not all originate
from the internet use

19
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.110 
there are also risk in the digital
world affected by the computer

20
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
computer systems themselves,
there are, of course, a couple

21
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:55.280 
of risk, a large domain of risk which originated
in the interconnection of a computer

22
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.890 
with the internet and as they
are a large number of risk

23
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.130 
when using a company's
internet technologies

24
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.800 
inside their
cooperative networks

25
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.520 
Let's look at some of theses
risk in more detail

26
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.720 
So, let's start with data processing. So,
risk in processing electronic information

27
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.930 
even without an internet
connection is the unavailability

28
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.060 
The unavailability of a computer
system or a database because it

29
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.340 
crashed or something gone
wrong or it's defective,

30
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.110 
data loss, data misuse,
data theft are risk

31
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.060 
when users of local users get access
or try to get access to this

32
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.270 
electronic data on the server.
The human factor often the

33
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.360 
unintentional misuse

34
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.120 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

35
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.360 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh unintentional a misuse

36
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.750 
People do not completely understand
or they are no specialist

37
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.930 
do not know what to do in a special
situation and then as a failure that occur

38
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.180 
provide a risk to data or
damaged or lost he when

39
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.950 
we speak about human factors and
this is done unintentionally

40
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.660 
So, incorrect incomplete system
configurations are a big topic

41
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.600 
for computer security, a lack of
data backup. So, when we will

42
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.650 
speak about this later when data
are misused or falsified and

43
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.610 
the user has made backups
regularly that it's

44
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.120 
not a big issue but in case of a lack
of data backup it becomes a big issue

45
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.530 
So, malicious software infiltration via
external data carriers, via misuse

46
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.970 
of mobile devices
like a USB stick

47
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.740 
or others. The incorrect
data management

48
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.720 
so, for example, accidental
deletion of files

49
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.250 
but of course, there is a
risk particularly when this

50
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.270 
IT systems are connected
with the internet

51
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.500 
then the attackers also came
from the outside world, so,

52
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.360 
the loss of data, data theft particularly
of sensible data, deletion, forgery

53
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.920 
or the loss of confidentiality
which is a problem in case of

54
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.250 
competition between companies
or in the political

55
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.560 
world with some
indiscretion

56
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.960 
The sabotage of database, sabotage of
systems' operation, sabotage of a service,

57
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.710 
the infiltration of malicious
software into system, viruses

58
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.930 
trojans, spyware,
ransomware

59
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:13.110 
It's a huge risk and so easy to
get such malicious software

60
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.680 
in their own system to be run, malfunctions
by Denial of Service attacks (DoS)

61
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.180 
over the internet, harm

62
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.960 
of the public image,
the defacement

63
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.380 
or falsification of websites, the misuse
of internet addresses by third parties

64
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.350 
so, there is a long list of
risk in the digital world

65
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.730 
in the context of data
processing, on systems that are

66
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.870 
connected to
the internet

67
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.660 
The third family of risk I want to
mention are the risk inside an intranet

68
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.820 
An intranet is an
isolated network

69
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.390 
which is operated by
means of the internet

70
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.390 
protocols and internet technology.
It isn't the responsibility

71
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.040 
of a corporation or an
institution, so, inside this

72
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:15.700 
network internet technology is used and so,
we get all the problems also mistakes

73
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.170 
in the internet protocols and how
it can play a role, although

74
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.540 
in such isolated networks. So, if
we look at the security risk

75
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.270 
then a big one is an unauthorized and
unwanted access to confidential information

76
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.650 
for example, management decisions,
salary information, personnel files

77
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.710 
So, statistic tells us
asked us that 80%

78
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.420 
of the misuse of IT systems is
originated from the employees

79
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.680 
they want to see what's the
salary of my colleague

80
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.000 
they want to see what's the
decision made for the future

81
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.960 
what are the
department decisions

82
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:10.990 
So, a reason which increases
these risk on the intranet is

83
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:19.130 
that more and more media migrate
to the electronic form

84
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.790 
so, what formerly was written on paper
now it's written electronically and

85
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.210 
at the end, it is printed out. So,
archiving, messaging systems,

86
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:38.520 
voicemails, the newsgroup, videos are all
electronically available and so, the

87
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.740 
possibility to access data
on this electronical way

88
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:52.600 
is increasing very much and
the chance to get access to

89
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:59.550 
confidential data. Is it
possible to measure that risk?

90
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.250 
This is an important question because
when one takes countermeasures

91
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:13.570 
by special systems or special
software or employs additional

92
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.160 
cybersecurity staff members,
then this cost money

93
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.960 
So, it would be helpful to be
able to compare the risk

94
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:31.600 
for loss of money, loss of
information and others to compare

95
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.440 
it with what is the cost of
countermeasure systems

96
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.980 
So, in the standard
ISO 31000

97
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.640 
31000 - a definition
is given

98
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:54.350 
about risk and the definition
says that we can characterize

99
00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:01.600 
a risk in two different dimensions - we
can measure it in the amount of damage

100
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.990 
and we can measure it in
the expected frequency

101
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:14.260 
of that event, for example, damage
in hard disk or other things

102
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.240 
So, the risk in the use of computer
system and the internet have increased

103
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.500 
dramatically in both facets as
well in the amount of damage

104
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.360 
that's possible as well in
the expected frequency

105
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.450 
So, when one performs
such a risk analysis

106
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:41.440 
then one should go
in the following 4

107
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.050 
steps and it consists of
4 phases. So, Phase 1

108
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:54.650 
is to define the domain for the
analysis of risk and damage

109
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:03.610 
so, the analysis domain is necessary to
know exactly what kind of specific

110
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.940 
risks are there in that
domain and what is possible

111
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.290 
possible to do against

112
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.930 
Considering a large IT system, one should
define different such analysis domains

113
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.470 
to have a chance to measure
really the risk objectively

114
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:31.850 
Then, in Phase 2, if one has
defined such an analysis domain

115
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:38.150 
one has to describe the risk in
this specific analysis domain

116
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:44.450 
There are two approaches - one
approach is scenario-based, so, one

117
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.310 
defines a scenario and investigates
what could happen in that scenario

118
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:55.730 
and what kind of risk occur in
view of this analysis domain

119
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.530 
and the other approach is a
simulation-based approach

120
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.170 
to describe the risk in
that analysis domain

121
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:11.080 
Then the risk needs to be assessed.
So, risk assessment is Phase 3

122
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.530 
and here, classification
of risk needs to be done

123
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.760 
in terms of damage and
in terms of frequency

124
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:29.630 
One can do this by means of quality
assessment - high risk and low risk,

125
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:36.320 
one can do this with numbers and
then in the last phase, in Phase 4

126
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:46.422 
one has to interpret the results
obtained. Let's only look into

127
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.560 
one or two examples. So, let's
consider online banking

128
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.720 
and pitfalls in
that scale

129
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.420 
So, as well in online shopping
as well in online banking this

130
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.960 
became more and more popular
nowadays online shopping started

131
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.010 
earlier but meanwhile all the online
banking is done by at least half of the

132
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:15.910 
population. So, the transactions
which are provided as well from

133
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.010 
an online shop as well from the online
banking even more from the online banking

134
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.320 
the transaction are
typically secured

135
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:30.550 
They are encrypted connections,
TANs are used or special

136
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:36.030 
chip cards are used so, a lot of effort
is done to secure its transaction

137
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:43.150 
But what is the problem? The problem
is the inadequate protection

138
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.330 
measures on the computer
systems used by the customers

139
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.650 
used by the customers to perform
such operation and to store data

140
00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:00.150 
and this inadequate protection leads to and
makes it interesting for the attackers

141
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:06.440 
to steal the password. It is possible
in largely a protected system

142
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:14.480 
to disclose transaction, to infiltrate
a hidden malicious malware

143
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.740 
hidden malware programmes, for
example, to create new transactions

144
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.250 
and such things. Though not the
transaction and the protection

145
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.430 
of the transactions themselves
are a problem, the problem is

146
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:36.550 
the users' computing environment
which is used to start and to

147
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.420 
control such
transactions

148
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:51.390 
If we look to another group of IT
systems and services on the internet

149
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.610 
which are used in
social networks

150
00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.150 
Pitfalls - there are phishing
e-mail attacks using

151
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:08.320 
fake mails or website that looks
very similar, for example,

152
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.200 
to the website of a bank, the
website of your bank, and then

153
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.630 
the phishing mail says, "we have to
install a new function for you"

154
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.220 
"please login"

155
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:25.600 
and then it looks very
similar like the bank's

156
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.800 
website and then many
people put in their

157
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.270 
credentials, put in their
sensitive data but

158
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.940 
it was not collected and was
not asked by the bank to

159
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.880 
register, it was done by
attackers which in this way

160
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.260 
gets the sensible
data of the people

161
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:55.690 
and the reason is that the
users are not careful in

162
00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.030 
the verification of the sender's
address. They didn't realize

163
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.710 
that this mail or this website
is not the original one

164
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.190 
or was not sent by the
original person. It was

165
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.240 
sent by criminals, in this way
the criminals may collect the

166
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.410 
victim's personal data and later
on can misuse this data for

167
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.110 
starting own
transactions

168
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.090 
or another pitfall
is password reuse

169
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:33.350 
Reused password poses a big security risk
when the attackers are able to get

170
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.030 
passwords in their hand, they
can use these passwords

171
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.290 
and

172
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:48.210 
start activities with another
name of the original user

173
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.710 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

174
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.210 
uh uh uh uh start activities
another name of the original user

175
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:54.260 
So, password theft comprises of all other
accounts with the same access data

176
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.570 
There are only a few
remarks to internet risk

177
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:05.430 
but it is important to analyze first
what could happen before one later

178
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.400 
tries to find the right
methods for protection

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390 
hello everyone thanks for watching this video.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.620 
my name is Rui Mu. i come from central china normal university in wuhan china.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.950 
today i'm going to talk about our work modeling temporal association

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.190 
of cognition topic in MOOC discussion to track learners' cognitive engagement dynamics.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.360 
my presentation will be divided into four parts. motivation,

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.940 
approach, experiments, and conclusion. as we all know MOOCs provide

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.300 
quality and timely educational opportunities especially during

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.020 
the cova nineteen epidemic. however, it has a low completion rate.

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.820 
to investigate what affects learning outcome researchers used

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.120 
content analysis or cognitive network analysis to analyze large

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.380 
scale textual data generated in MOOC discussion forum posts.

12
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.310 
but this can only show learners static cognitive indicators.

13
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.900 
previous work in topic models focused on modeling learners'

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.410 
cognitive behaviors or dynamic emotions with topics.

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.460 
the dynamic cognition over time has been understudied.

16
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.420 
to fill the gap we built a topic model incorporating cognition

17
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.540 
dynamics to explore the temporal evolutions of learners cognitive topics over time.

18
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.830 
here i'd like to introduce the model. we assume that before posting

19
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.250 
learners cognitive distribution expresses their intuitive feelings.

20
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.600 
and their evaluation ideas are modeled by the probability distribution

21
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.840 
of each cognitive topic.

22
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.050 
then they determine the cognitive processing and the concerned

23
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.210 
topic of each sentence.

24
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.300 
finally the learner writes a sentence with the words. the completion

25
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.020 
of the sentence generates the corresponding timestamp and the

26
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.790 
multiple sentences make up a post.

27
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.420 
we expanded the dictionary by the sequence to sequence model proposed by zang

28
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.340 
and added as prior knowledge to capture cognitive engagement.

29
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.110 
TCTM can output the distribution of document cognition topic cognition topic word

30
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.370 
cognition topic time and document cognitive respectively.

31
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.980 
ok now we move to the experiment.
this study aims to answer the two questions

32
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.790 
one in the discussion forum what topics the learners concern

33
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.590 
about in terms of different cognitive processing categories.

34
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.300 
two what are the differences in the evolution trends of cognitive

35
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.540 
topics between completers and non completers.

36
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.920 
our data comes from september twentieth twenty nineteen to

37
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.260 
december sixteenth twenty nineteen of nanjing university psychology

38
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.170 
and life on the chinese university MOOC.

39
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.610 
one thousand two hundred seventy two learners participated

40
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.390 
in the discussion of the course and one hundred fourteen received the course certificate.

41
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.950 
the process data as described in table one. we conducted experiments

42
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.650 
between learners with different learning achievements completers

43
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.780 
and non completers.

44
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.010 
now let's come to the last part conclusion topics. it were related

45
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.580 
to the courses content exam certificates and evaluation

46
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.920 
whole group learners' cognitive engagement was mainly concentrated

47
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.380 
in the initial and final stages especially for the two categories discrepancy

48
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.400 
tentative in the final stage to prepare for the course exam

49
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.540 
and obtain the certificate.

50
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.380 
different achievements completers had more active and timely

51
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.580 
cognitive engagement as time went on they used certain cognitive

52
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.070 
words to focus on passing the examination and applying for the certificate.

53
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.240 
they had explicit learning goals and plans.

54
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.090 
they also used the insight and cars cognitive words to understand

55
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.730 
the knowledge to improve practical skills which showed they

56
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.970 
had more motivation to apply what they have learned.

57
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.870 
however non complete years use the exclusive cognitive words

58
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.120 
to discuss some off task content. this indicated a distracted

59
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.940 
learning stage that might be not conducive to the deep knowledge construction of learners.

60
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.980 
teaching guidance teachers need to set up some logistic topics

61
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
for discussion as early as possible such as requirements for

62
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.980 
obtaining certificates and stopping the off task postings in

63
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.140 
time to improve course completion rates.

64
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.700 
future studies could select several courses to carry out a larger sample survey.

65
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.650 
moreover the future modelling approach will consider the correlation

66
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.090 
between different adjacent timestamps of cognitive topic distributions.

67
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.590 
that's all for my presentation. if you have any questions, please

68
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.980 
feel free to contact me thank you.

Hi, a few words about myself. My name is Robin. I studied computer

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.960 
science and now work at Frachtwerk as a software engineer.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.940 
During my studies I gained experience in distributed systems and

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.350 
the internet of things. At Frachtwerk, I am focused on designing and implementing

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.870 
modern software systems with open source often as web applications.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.700 
What drives me personally is the impact that technology can

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.420 
have on our life and society.

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.170 
That's why sustainability in software engineering is especially important to me.

9
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.330 
In my part of this course, I will share my experience as a software developer

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
where aspects of resource efficiency can directly be applied

11
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.340 
when implementing software systems. I hope you enjoy the course

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.490 
and I will see you later.

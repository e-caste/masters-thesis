00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.050 
Ok ,Tom the success of remote work
has a lot to do with coordination.

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.770 
Which tools are there to help
us in coordinating the work?

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.270 
Ok, so in this video we
will be talking about

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.550 
project management tools, which
are helping us to coordinate

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.300 
the work, and then we also will
have a look at scheduling tools,

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.160 
which are helping us to
coordinate meetings.

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.530 
Face-to-face meetings. Ok.
Online supported face-to-face

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.750 
meetings. So let's start with
the project management tools

9
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.570 
I mean we need somehow to keep
teams on track, we need

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.730 
somehow to schedule
deadlines, we need

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.140 
to integrate all these
other tools that we've

12
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.150 
been talking about, particularly
if we're not using the big

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.060 
office suites by
the big players,

14
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.160 
It can come
very handy to

15
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
have a tool that helps us to
integrate all these other

16
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.630 
tools, that helps us to set the
deadlines, that helps us too

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.210 
set the milestones, and all
these all these things. Basic

18
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.290 
project management.
Tools that help you,

19
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.030 
also if you're working
not remote, but

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.840 
in an office
locally. So you,

21
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.390 
probably, know
Microsoft Project.

22
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.940 
Exactly, tools similar
to this one.

23
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.900 
But the tools that we
want to introduce here

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.820 
are cloud-based. And again
same issues as with all the

25
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.350 
other tools, privacy,
security, and so on...

26
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.000 
depending on your plans, paid plans, free
plans ... your needs ... and so on.

27
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.730 
Yeah so, we have a couple
of options here , we just

28
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.960 
listed a few of them, maybe
you know others? We will

29
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.050 
invite you again to
contribute, and they

30
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.370 
help you to do all these planning
things... It means that

31
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.250 
if i'm part of a team, i can see
all the time what the other

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.790 
people are doing? We can we can
share with each other what

33
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.590 
is the overview of the whole project?
Exactly, i mean we've seen

34
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.400 
this Kanban boards in one of
previous videos, normally

35
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.780 
these tools includes something like
a Kanban board, they include

36
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.730 
Gantt charts, all the
tools that you know.

37
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.970 
I believe the coordination will
be extremely useful because

38
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.530 
if you finish one task and after
that, I shall continue then

39
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
I will receive a notification
or something like that,

40
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.900 
in order to continue with
my task... Exactly, I

41
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.880 
mean it's all about
configuration,

42
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.960 
All of these tools
have sort of hooks,

43
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.480 
where you can combine them
with the other tools.

44
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.550 
For example if you have

45
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
your ticketing tool and then
you say: well this ticket

46
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.450 
it is done then it can directly
send a message to the

47
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.860 
Kanban board so that it moves the item
from one column of the Kanban Board

48
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.920 
to the next one. It can
send an email to the team

49
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.490 
leader so that the team leader
knows that you need a new task.

50
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.450 
But it's all configuration ...
But in the remote structure,

51
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.550 
in the remote environment it
is extremely important,

52
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.410 
this kind of coordination. At the
office we will not have that problem

53
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.060 
because, ok i tell the other
person that I'm done, but in a

54
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.170 
remote structure is by
far more complex.

55
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.940 
Definitely, and so this is
really important to have these

56
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.410 
notifications set
up correctly.

57
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.140 
I mean, you also need to make
sure that you don't get too

58
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.880 
much of these notifications,
because then at

59
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.840 
some point you can will
be completely ....

60
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.030 
overloaded with that
and just a ...

61
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.800 
I mean, i've been doing that
myself, just kind of make a rule

62
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.140 
in your e-mail client to move these notifications
directly to the spam folder or some other

63
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.840 
folder, which is not a
spam folder but which is

64
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.650 
as good as the spam
folder because

65
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.990 
you don't see them
anymore. Ok. So yeah,

66
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.400 
let's go to the to the other
kind of tools that we've been

67
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.430 
a announcing the
scheduling tools.

68
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.490 
And these are very
important if you, i mean,

69
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.710 
as we said in the first video
about the video calls,

70
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.610 
the video chats, you need to
schedule these meetings.

71
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.340 
It's not that you can just
go online and then....

72
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.350 
so that you have everyone there, not just
two of the ten people that you wanted

73
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.480 
to have ... Exactly and
particularly if you're working in

74
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.050 
remote teams, with team
members in different time

75
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.830 
zones there's one tool,
which really, sometimes it

76
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.850 
really can get complicated to
find a time slot where all

77
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.360 
of them are awake, I mean
normally you should try to....

78
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.230 
Sometimes it doesn't work, but we
will see that in a demo. There's

79
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.260 
one tool, which I really like,
which i use very often

80
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.010 
and this really helps
you to schedule

81
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.100 
these meetings.

82
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.080 
You can see it's a
little online tool.

83
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.900 
I mean, normally, there's not so
much privacy concerns here,

84
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.310 
you don't enter the
addresses of your

85
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.910 
team members, it's just a couple
of cities, time zones, so

86
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.670 
that should be fine... So that is
where the people are located

87
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.060 
with whom you want to talk?... Exactly
so if you want to schedule a

88
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.760 
meeting with, Ii mean, let's
imagine you have a team, someone

89
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.290 
is sitting in San Francisco, someone
is sitting in Berlin, someone

90
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.470 
sitting London, someone sitting in
Moscow. With all these different

91
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.690 
time zones it can
become a little

92
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.850 
difficult. There's other tools
which help you with that ...

93
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.450 
timeanddate.com ... for
example, which help you

94
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.560 
to figure out the time
zones and then you could

95
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.690 
check them, but this tool
is really handy. Because

96
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.920 
you just go and say
well San Francisco,

97
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:07.130 
then we have one person
sitting in Berlin,

98
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.160 
Germany, another
one in London

99
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.010 
and someone in Moscow.

100
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.840 
And then you see, what you
need to do now is just

101
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.350 
like find the green line ...
OK, in all the cities...

102
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.590 
Obviously we have a problem here
because there is no green

103
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.740 
line, I mean that happens
if you have teams,

104
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.140 
distributed teams in different
time zones, but still

105
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.960 
there is an area where
you could say that

106
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.110 
this is still ok ... You try
to avoid the red ones?...

107
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.660 
You try to avoid red ones
because then somebody has to

108
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.210 
get up in the middle of the
night.... OK, I understand.

109
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.040 
But then the yellows are still not,
the yellows are stillnot working

110
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.630 
hours anymore, but it's
still ... Yeah you

111
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.090 
can wake up at seven then you can
have a meeting at seven, but

112
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.600 
much better than waking up at
three or two in the morning.

113
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.900 
OK that's great!

114
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.810 
OK, it means that date and time they
also play a role in coordinating

115
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.590 
the teams and, therefore, these
scheduling tools are also important

116
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.070 
for setting up the meetings. Otherwise
you will have only half of the people

117
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.260 
that you need to in the
meetings.... Exactly!

118
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.900 
Probably the community
has experience

119
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.840 
to use other tools,

120
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.830 
other project management
tools that also help teams

121
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.970 
to work better. Please join the discussion,
we're looking forward to that.

Hi! I'm Molly Wilson, I'm a UX
designer and a design educator

2
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.960 
and I'm here to talk with
you about making meaning.

3
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.500 
So when you do design research
you find a lot of information

4
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.620 
but you need to know what that
information means. You need to

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.340 
know what to do with it. So you
need to go from information

6
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.390 
to interpretation. How do you do
this? By making connections.

7
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
You connect the information
that you have

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.720 
by putting it in context with
other pieces of information.

9
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.650 
You want to consider the entire
world that this information

10
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
lives in. This sounds really
abstract so let's think through

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.550 
it by thinking about
an actual example.

12
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.320 
What if you are doing research and
asking people about how they

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.270 
track their daily spending. You
talk to one person and she says

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.960 
that managing money is
annoying. Yeah, alright.

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.570 
On its own, this quote actually
doesn't mean that much.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.600 
But once you start to find out
more information about this

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.250 
person, you'll start to see how
you might interpret this quote.

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.560 
So I'm going to tell you a little
more about her. What if she

19
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.550 
is the singer in a rock band and
her band tours a lot. Her band

20
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.610 
has seven people in it. She
writes most of the songs, she's

21
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.520 
the main creative force
behind the band

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.560 
and she thinks that managing
money is annoying.

23
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.780 
Now we can interpret this quote. We
can make some educated guesses

24
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.600 
about its hidden meaning.
She's a singer:

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.710 
She probably didn't think she
was going to have to do this

26
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.130 
kind of money management when
she decided to be a singer or

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.080 
when she founded the band.
She had to learn somehow.

28
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.180 
That learning process may not
have been easy or expected.

29
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.240 
She tours with seven people: this is
a big group, this is complicated.

30
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.620 
It's probably complicated
logistically and also complicated

31
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.150 
socially. It's not just
about her and her money.

32
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.000 
She writes the songs herself
so she's the creative

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.670 
force. She probably feels
attention between the creative

34
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.390 
side and the analytical
side of her work.

35
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.950 
Maybe it kills her
creative buzz sometimes.

36
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.350 
You could explore these hidden
meanings even more and see if

37
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.070 
patterns start to emerge when
you talk to more people,

38
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.300 
do more research and validate
some of these interpretations.

39
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.060 
When you start to see patterns
in the hidden meanings that

40
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.730 
you're finding, that is when you
know that you found something

41
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.570 
really deep an
interesting.

1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
you are an employer with more than
thirty employees. how did you

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.110 
react to this situation on march and
it was suddenly clear that everyone

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.310 
had to stay at home? first of
all and it was not that big

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.110 
change for us. because we've been working
from home long before the crisis.

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.060 
I'm so there was no big change for us at
that time so everything went smoothly.

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.780 
and for some months now we are
more less back at the office.

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.710 
and that now we are not working
highlights or everyone can

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.830 
decide whether he or she wants to work
from, from our office or from home

9
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.470 
old from any other place in the
world which theoretically is

10
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.870 
possible at the moment due to
the rise of course is limited.

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.950 
and we already are also
agreed on the new

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.860 
work the time model
and how work should

13
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.050 
look like a couple
after the crisis.

14
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.010 
half a year has passed since
march how's it going?

15
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.120 
fine, thank you for asking. and so
what we realised what really changed

16
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.110 
for expectant of that and the working
times became much more flexible.

17
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.090 
instead of looking at our real
people tend to work like three

18
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.350 
or four times a day with
two or three hours

19
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.970 
at first he was young should
be even before the vices

20
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.870 
and to be honest from my bots
perspective what I learned is

21
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.010 
flogging a free church strength and
weaknesses of every single employee

22
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.470 
even better than when working face
to face. so a good employee

23
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.150 
becomes an excellent one when
working remote and the lazy one

24
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.760 
is still lazy when he or she is at
home. but what we also learned

25
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.030 
is how important personal
contact between people is so

26
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.220 
that's what's missing at the moment
when we are not in the office.

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.480 
that's why we decided to have
two big team events during

28
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.060 
the next weeks into the end of
the year. and they will come

29
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.750 
much more events next
year, but of course

30
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.420 
at the moment
we have to

31
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.450 
pay attention to the restrictions due
to the hygiene regulation. and so

32
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.550 
we can do everything we would like
to do. but I think that some

33
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.060 
good things coming up for our team.
what challenges do you see in

34
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.130 
this home of the small? the
biggest challenge we realized

35
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.810 
was introducing new people to our team. so
at the moment our company is growing.

36
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.760 
and during the lockdown times
we had six new employees

37
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.390 
in our team. and was quite a big
challenge to make them fit

38
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.480 
into the team while everyone was at home
and they could not meet anyone directly.

39
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.120 
and especially not the social
interaction. there was no such social

40
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.070 
action in the kitchen or whatever
people do when they are not

41
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.250 
really working but they
grow together as a team

42
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.080 
and that there will be another
challenge for farce in the field

43
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.880 
coming up next year as part of
our and sustainable strategy,

44
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.930 
how a company could greatly
decided to author on vocational

45
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.640 
training in two different
professions from next year on.

46
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.020 
so terribly young people probably
younger than eighteen have

47
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.550 
never looked before who would join
our team and we would probably

48
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.940 
still be working more
than us from home.

49
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.470 
how did you react to your individual
customers during the special time?

50
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.970 
we wanted to set an example
directly at the beginning

51
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.110 
of the crisis in the month of
march. we decided to turn to give

52
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.630 
away all our self-learning courses
for free. this is an awful

53
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.530 
that was taken up more than
seventy five thousand times by

54
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.010 
people all around the world and
certainly cannot compare this

55
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.000 
years and numbers to the
ones from last year.

56
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.580 
but after this little free offer for
them we did that for about a weeks.

57
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.650 
since then we were seeing a growth
off like thirty forty percent

58
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.790 
as in e-learning courses of any
type which is probably less

59
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.280 
than most of you might
have expected.

60
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.830 
but we may think this is
due to the fact that

61
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.140 
people have been doing everything in a
digital way during the last month.

62
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.070 
so if you're sitting in front of
camera eight hours a day, do

63
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.580 
you really want to take

64
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.230 
further education
online as well?

65
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.330 
or I may be more likely to do that
face to face of it's possible?

66
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.770 
but the digital courses are coming
up next year in some way.

67
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.080 
but on the other hand in the long
term, I am quite sure that

68
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.640 
there will be a big change in
the field of education,

69
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.570 
no matter which end of education
all we see is that er there's

70
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.910 
a trend that everything becomes
more and more flexible and

71
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.980 
also smaller more individual.
and probably this is what you

72
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.000 
could call these learning nuggets
that perfectly fit into your life.

73
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.150 
and most of the learning nuggets
that also will be digital.

74
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.670 
I'm campbell says specialised in the
digitalization of learning content.

75
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.520 
however educational institutions related
to this topic in corona times?

76
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.610 
an initially so directly after
the lockdown we were facing

77
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:29.410 
and unmanageable huge a number of
requests we could never never never

78
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.020 
a realize even if there was a budget
of millions of millions of euros.

79
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.710 
I'm so schooled in verse within the
article institutions expected us

80
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.330 
to digitize all
what they do

81
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.980 
within two or three days
which is impossible.

82
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.610 
but now this changed for what we now see
is really attract coming up that

83
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.720 
institutions came over the shop
and now a real life what they

84
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.610 
can change for the future so how
could admit or long term future

85
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.360 
of learning look like no matter
what that school university

86
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.180 
or tried culture
whatever.

87
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.900 
and so what now coming up is really
interesting requests what

88
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.730 
on campus could do for them start
with learning platforms near

89
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.630 
ideas how content could look like
models. for example digital

90
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.350 
events or conferences that we might support
her companies or institutions with.

91
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.370 
so what i see big big potential
for digital learning

92
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.440 
in future in any
type of education.

93
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.200 
and how has the demand for a
digital concert for companies

94
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.720 
had changed
since march?

95
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.610 
so what we first were facing was
it dropped in the moment and

96
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.350 
from all those companies and who were
uncertain of their economical future.

97
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.030 
so they were facing a crisis and
then they stopped their investment

98
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.680 
in education as well. and there was
another uncertainty for companies

99
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.480 
especially for those who have never
worked with a digital learning

100
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.330 
before. and many many questions about data
protection laws which you might know

101
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.890 
in your are not that easy to understand
and people tend to struggle with it.

102
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.850 
but now six months later and most
of the companies are looking

103
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.700 
more or less optimistic and there
may be a long term future

104
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.850 
and i started dusting investing
often that people in education.

105
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.970 
so although not everyone it's a planning
a full digital future of course

106
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.890 
and learning becomes more and more digital
for a corporate learning as well.

107
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.590 
so what I see a growing market for
digital corporate learning

108
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.770 
as well as for the traditional
education sector.

109
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.890 
tell us about your
future perspective.

110
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.380 
so the shock has been overcome
now and we are looking

111
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.080 
into the sustainable future
which probably will contain

112
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.860 
more and more digital but also
blended learning scenarios in

113
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.830 
any type of learning. no matter
that sprang a school or working

114
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.930 
directly on the job. so green for
all sectors and that advantage

115
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.730 
of more digital more flexible
learning, but it would not replace

116
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.200 
all face to face
learning.

117
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:31.250 
but at the end of this crisis will change a
our sectors of signification permanently.

118
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.920 
I think most of the big changes
for big changes will see

119
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.890 
in a few years. because especially for public
institutions like schools or universities.

120
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.940 
it's actually a long time until they
can really change their plans

121
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.120 
which of course has also stayed
with the financial restrictions

122
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.420 
and budgets they have and so on
and i cannot directly transfer

123
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.820 
from face to face to online. but in the
future, i guess this will happen.

124
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.370 
so maybe we should meet again in
like five years and see what

125
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.040 
really happened after the prices and
whether our ideas were right or

126
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.220 
the future did more digital
than we can imagine.

127
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:18.640 
I would like to finish her our
little conversation with a quote

128
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.960 
which you cannot see behind
me. it comes from above gun

129
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.990 
was the founder and former ceo
of ambles and what he said was

130
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.980 
that in the end digital education
is not more expensive but better.

131
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.970 
and I would like to add
something to this quote.

132
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.400 
so I think in the end digital
education is not more expensive.

133
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.320 
but better but it's also
more sustainable.

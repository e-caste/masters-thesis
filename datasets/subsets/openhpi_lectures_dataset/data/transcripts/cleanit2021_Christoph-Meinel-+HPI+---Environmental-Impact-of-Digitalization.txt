00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.240 
Ladies and Gentlemen, I
welcome you to our clean

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.990 
IT that's an initiative
of the Hasso Plattner Institute

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.220 
towards sustainable
digital technologies.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.160 
Our world is characterized by
the digital transformation.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.740 
Around the world the society are
changed by the digital technologies,

6
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.680 
it has changed how we communicate
with each other, it is changed

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.470 
how we produce things, it's
changed how we educate

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.970 
people, it's changed how
societies are organized, and if

9
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.790 
you want to see who are we humans
in this digital transformation

10
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.760 
then please look
here, there

11
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.010 
we are and that's a great wave
that is changing our world.

12
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.970 
People and machines are globally
interconnected by the internet.

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.230 
The internet is about 50 years
old and provides the mean

14
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.250 
and stance for all the changes coming by
the introduction of digital technologies.

15
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.710 
So to give only one figure that's
the development of the number of

16
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.410 
smart devices that are
devices or machines,

17
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.680 
cars, smartphones,

18
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
sensors that can use the internet
to interconnect with each other.

19
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.110 
50 billion, this is what we see in a
couple of years of such smart devices

20
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.920 
which are used to organize our
life. And on the other side, we

21
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.430 
have the world as it is, with all
the huge problems concerning

22
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.890 
poverty, concerning the climate,
concerning that not

23
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.060 
all humans have enough to eat,

24
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.820 
not all the people
are educated in the world

25
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.850 
and this has resulted in the
sustainable development goals,

26
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.060 
which describes the goals of
humanity which are formulated

27
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
by the United Nations.

28
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.450 
And the interesting thing
is with the digital

29
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.660 
technologies, we can tackle a lot of
such global society challenges

30
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.340 
which are described by this
sustainable development goals.

31
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.770 
We can provide

32
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.680 
better control and interaction of
machine of production processes

33
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.050 
by avoiding traveling, by means of
digital technologies, we can impact

34
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.720 
the climate question and help to solve climate
problem, we can provide better education

35
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.520 
to people, we can by means of the digital
technologies improve health care system,

36
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.720 
we can improve the
production, we can do something

37
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.470 
against poverty and
hunger around the world. Ao

38
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.990 
a lot of contributions are expected
coming from the digital technology

39
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.500 
to solve this a UN sustainable
development goals.

40
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.120 
So here at Hasso Plattner Institute we have
such a dashboard with actually shows

41
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.780 
where we are, in which way we contribute
to the a sustainable development goals.

42
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.090 
Here are the 17 goals and the
different contributions you

43
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.810 
can see this here on our
website which is defined.

44
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.780 
But the digital
technologies

45
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.580 
can not only contribute
to services problems,

46
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.220 
the digital technologies
also cause new problems.

47
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.630 
The technologies contribute
significantly to the global

48
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.390 
carbon emissions.

49
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.690 
So digital
technologies will

50
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.830 
help to decrease carbon emissions in other
sectors by providing means to find

51
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.930 
control complex systems

52
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.090 
by the possibilities which are
provided by artificial intelligence

53
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.710 
by use of data analytics. So very
important contribution will

54
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.480 
come by digital technologies to decrease
the carbon emissions, but same time

55
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.440 
carbon emissions of all the computing
systems of all the internet

56
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.310 
is increasing and
need to be reduced.

57
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.990 
To give a few examples, so if we look to
the environmental impact of digitalisation

58
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.840 
and compare this and look
to the global internet traffic

59
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.930 
on the rise which is rising, and if we
consider what kind of energy is needed

60
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.240 
to organise this, then it's very impressive
to look to the number of data

61
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.880 
that are transmitted over the internet.
So the internet traffic globally

62
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.040 
starts 10 years- 15 years
ago so from 54

63
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:36.440 
Exabyte, then to Zetabyte up to
4.2 ZB and

64
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.680 
to remind you Exabytes,
this is one billion

65
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.210 
Gigabytes, and Zetabyte it is one trillion
Gigabytes. So there is a huge

66
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.940 
data traffic around the
world that is needed to push

67
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.140 
the digitalization and to push
the digital transformation.

68
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.460 
And if we look to the environmental
impact of digitalisation,

69
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:09.620 
then today the use of the digital
systems, computers, smartphones, networks

70
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.580 
needs more energy than the production
of these devices.

71
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.510 
So using digital systems consumes
already today more energy

72
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.900 
than producing computers,
smartphones and it

73
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.830 
will rise in future much more
which is shown in The Shift Project

74
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.350 
from 2017.

75
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.600 
If we look for some examples, for
example how much energy is needed

76
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.060 
to train an AI model with the
technologies from today,

77
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:53.810 
then we see that to train AI
model needs about the same energy

78
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.750 
and produces about the same
amount of carbon emission like

79
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.830 
300 round trip lives flights
between San francisco and New York,

80
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:12.210 
or like 5 car life cycles from
production over the running.

81
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.050 
So one AI model to train
needs so much energy.

82
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.960 
And if you see what is
assumed to be provided by

83
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.890 
artificial intelligence,
we need to do something.

84
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.340 
Here another example, this
example I have to mention it

85
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.760 
was before Corona crisis, even before
Corona crisis arises, this is a huge

86
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:44.030 
air traffic, the carbon
footprint of all the

87
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:51.830 
airplanes around the world
was half as much like the

88
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.140 
carbon footprint of the
IT ot the information technology.

89
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.440 
So these are impressive
numbers and this is

90
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:09.540 
the result and that from Hasso Plattner
Institute we discussed about that

91
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.110 
as a developer of such
new technologies

92
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.010 
we felt responsible
also to

93
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.610 
bring awareness to this fact. And
this was exactly the birth

94
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:28.420 
date of our clean IT initiative. We
launched it at the World Economic Forum,

95
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.560 
2020 in Davos

96
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:39.500 
and the idea of the initiative is to
contribute to reduce the energy needs

97
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.070 
by increasing the power
of digital technology.

98
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:51.770 
So HPI signs the UN Global Compact
contract, our clean IT initiative

99
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.750 
was launched, we invited partner and
we encouraged the researcher in HPI

100
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.990 
to research an energy efficient
IT systems, computer systems

101
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.720 
AI algorithms and in
this way to support

102
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:16.330 
the SDG's. So this is a reason that
we want to see what we are doing

103
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:22.480 
with the SDG dashboard. So here
are some partners, the SAP

104
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.040 
the largest European

105
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.990 
digital company, we get interested by
our partner university

106
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.340 
is like Technion or
the University

107
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:44.370 
of Technology in Beijing.
We incorporated and invited

108
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.560 
associations like
the eco, IEEE

109
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.040 
to partner in this
clean initiative and

110
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.860 
technical the German
Academie of Technique

111
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.830 
Sciences.

112
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:09.170 
What is a clean IT forum? Here we
want to provide a virtual platform

113
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.760 
to exchange ideas, to exchange
information about clean IT projects,

114
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.270 
about clean IT activities.

115
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.670 
So you can find on the forum and
you can also contribute with your

116
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.970 
knowledge and your ideas on how to
save energy using digital devices

117
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.420 
in everyday life. We will show and
introduce, discuss our clean

118
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.080 
IT solutions from HPI

119
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.490 
and we will discuss the clean IT
solutions and introduce

120
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.070 
clean IT solutions from our
partners I already mentioned.

121
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.330 
So the contributions of HPI
go in different directions, so

122
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.210 
we look for energy efficient
algorithms and databases, we look

123
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:03.010 
for energy-aware computing, next
generation computing centers

124
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.790 
and for energy
efficient AI systems.

125
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:14.380 
So we see clean IT forum that is
using and that can be reached

126
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.710 
on openhpi.de
platform. We share

127
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.640 
with you practical ideas, conceptions,
and solutions. Please also contribute,

128
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.060 
send us video clips, send
us other material which we

129
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.850 
want to present here in our forum, which
we want to discuss in our forum

130
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:43.910 
to push energy-efficient

131
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.440 
IT technologies forward.

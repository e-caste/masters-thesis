00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.330 
in the talk we describe our ongoing work to inform the design

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.480 
of an artificial intelligence based tool that adds value to

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.410 
higher education classroom lectures. I'm Shipi Dhanorkar,

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.750 
a worker and i'll be presenting our working progress on behalf of my co-authors

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.180 
benjamin heller and mary beth rossen. our project is titled

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.120 
what do i need to know?  designing student learning tools that

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.780 
aid interaction with recorded lecture content.

9
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.820 
a recent science article that observed more than two thousand college classrooms

10
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.450 
found that instructor's oral delivery of content remains to

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.830 
be a central element of many courses.

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.370 
didactic style where eighty percent or more of the class time

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.090 
consists of lecturing with minimal student involvement has

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.640 
surfaced as the prominent instructional style.

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.560 
several instructional techniques have been proposed to alleviate the passivity

16
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.280 
in lecture-based learning like peer instruction and flipped learning.

17
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.990 
we are interested in the ways in which classroom discourse

18
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
can be made usable beyond simply recreating face to face lectures.

19
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.870 
more specifically we ask how can we transform an instructor's oral performance

20
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.750 
from a talking at experience to a broader and more active set

21
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.880 
of opportunities for student learning.

22
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.830 
initial research for lecture capture tackled multimedia challenges.

23
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.410 
since then advances in nlp have been applied to lecture processing.

24
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.470 
an emerging research topic is physical learning analytics.

25
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.980 
DART is a novel machine learning algorithm that classifies

26
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.630 
audio recordings a single multiple or no voice with the goal to

27
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.480 
distinguish lecture from non lecture activity.

28
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.410 
and to thereby infer presence or absence of active learning

29
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.850 
techniques in the classroom.

30
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.240 
to explore or opportunity we have begun to design an AI based tool called spectrum

31
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.540 
that can process lecture recordings in ways that can make them

32
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.640 
more useful and engaging to students.

33
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.170 
in its current state spectrum provides a web-based visualization

34
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.030 
of a course lecture by representing each thirty second chunk

35
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.660 
of audio as a bar in a time-based chart.

36
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
in this visualization we see a course level view where we see

37
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.740 
how some lectures focus on only one or two course topics,

38
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.650 
while other lectures interlace many ideas and topics that occur

39
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.760 
later in the course.

40
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.430 
here we see a detailed look at a single course lecture displaying

41
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.150 
how the transcript of the course maps on to the topics discussed in the lecture.

42
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.240 
to investigate students' expectations and preferences about

43
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.580 
tools such as spectrum we carried out a survey in which we

44
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.570 
relied on two high level probes that both interact tools like spectrum.

45
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.920 
we identified different opportunity areas such as identifying

46
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.620 
key concepts of menting lecture content with useful examples.

47
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.650 
and drawing on verbal cues used by the instructor during the lecture.

48
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.210 
using ai to track down key announcements from the instructor

49
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.890 
was also seen as desirable.

50
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.100 
some students were apprehensive about learning alongside intelligent

51
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.620 
tools raising nuanced issues like trust with the AI.

52
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.960 
r project attempts to combine rich textual analysis of captured

53
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.910 
lectures with learner-centred design.

54
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.680 
we're using three hypothetical learner stories as motivations,

55
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.730 
illustrating them with rough sketches of possible student facing tools

56
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.850 
that leverage spectrum's AI functionality.

57
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.210 
this is our next step in refining our design space.

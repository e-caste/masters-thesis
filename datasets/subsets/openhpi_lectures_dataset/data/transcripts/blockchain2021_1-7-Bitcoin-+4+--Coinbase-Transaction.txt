00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.830 
In our openHPI course "Blockchain:
Revealing the Myth",

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.600 
we want to have a closer look
into this way how users are

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.480 
incentivized to form blocks and we
consider coinbase transactions.

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.570 
Step by step we realized that the
bitcoin system and the bitcoin

5
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.970 
solution is really
of high complexity.

6
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.410 
It is difficult to provide a system
for electronic transaction that

7
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.760 
does not rely on trust.

8
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.550 
What we have, we have a system
for participants to agree on

9
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.170 
a single chronological order of
transactions, the majority decision

10
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.780 
is represented by the longest
chain which has the greatest

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.410 
proof of work effort invested in
it. You remember we assume that

12
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.310 
the majority of computing
resources are in the hand of

13
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.620 
honest users. And then we have a solution
to the double spending problem

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.790 
that

15
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.210 
cybercriminals try to spend their
money twice for different things.

16
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880 
And we have the solution
to prevent this

17
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.260 
by a peer to peer distributed timestamping
to generate a computational proof

18
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.920 
of the chronological order
of the transaction.

19
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.590 
So the central question that remains to
discuss is how users are incentivized

20
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.260 
to comply with the rules and to provide
a proof of work to create new

21
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.730 
new blocks. And in
the last clip we

22
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.260 
indicated that new coins are
minted by the work done.

23
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.590 
So if a user has decided he has
decided to participate in the race

24
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.360 
and to try his luck to get the reward
for a successful generated new block,

25
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.010 
then he starts to create a new
block - a so called candidate block.

26
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.640 
You remember, the user receives new transaction,
collects transaction and can decide

27
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.590 
to start to create a block. To
create a block he has to do

28
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.160 
a lot of work, he has to

29
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.450 
do the proof of work, has to serve a
very strong computational problem

30
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.190 
and with this, it's not clear
whether the block he

31
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.630 
creates and he
broadcasts to

32
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.590 
other users is really becoming a
block in the longest chain. So

33
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.340 
it's only a
candidate block.

34
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
And what motivates
the user

35
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.080 
to step into that race?

36
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.850 
And to this end the user
takes out all transactions

37
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.360 
when he wants to create a block,
he takes out all transaction

38
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.780 
from its memory pool,

39
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.120 
this is a buffer

40
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.260 
where he has
stored all his

41
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.230 
received transactions

42
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.300 
and fills them into
a candidate block.

43
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.820 
And in the candidate block,
the first transaction

44
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.740 
in such a block is a special transaction
that starts a new coin owned

45
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.010 
by the user who
creates the block.

46
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.210 
And this transaction is also
called a coinbase transaction

47
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.640 
and it allows the user to send
himself a fixed amount of coins

48
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.550 
that did not previously exist
together with the fees

49
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920 
and he also gets fees
of the transactions

50
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.150 
included in the block.

51
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.320 
So here new coins are created by
means of says coinbase transaction.

52
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.310 
After two hundred ten
thousand blocks, the rewards

53
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.670 
paid to the miners in form of a newly
created coin of newly created coins

54
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.400 
will be halved. So approximately
this is about every four years

55
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.810 
and starting in two thousand twenty, now
there is the amount only six point

56
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.020 
twenty five bitcoin. When
the system was started

57
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.750 
by Satoshi Nakamoto it
was fifty coins.

58
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.680 
So here this is the creation of
new coins by means of such

59
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.590 
by means of such code
base transaction.

60
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.470 
The creation of the new
block generates a hash

61
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.310 
of the previous blocks and this
has to be added to the block.

62
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
Then the user generates a hash of
the block and he does this

63
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.970 
in combination with
the nonce

64
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.430 
to get a value that's
below the current target.

65
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.580 
And as soon as he has found the
appropriate nonce, he can bradcast

66
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.360 
the created block
to the network.

67
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.200 
And

68
00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:02.120 
when the user can spend the coins he
claimed from the coinbase transaction?

69
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.870 
Of course when the user broad-
casts the block it's not clear

70
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.740 
whether this block become a
member of the longest chain.

71
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:22.880 
So you see the user can spend this
coins from the coinbase transaction

72
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.790 
merely once the block becomes at
least ninety nine successive blocks

73
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.460 
in the longest chain.

74
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.380 
So he needs to wait up to the moment
it's really clear that his block

75
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.430 
is block of the
blocked chain.

76
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.700 
All the users that do not manage to get
their blocks into the block chain

77
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.960 
they will not receive an award
they will not receive new coins.

78
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:57.070 
Therefore this block reward acts
as an incentive for the miners

79
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.580 
to mine new blocks and to continually
try to extend the longest

80
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:09.940 
known chain by blocks because in this way the
user, the successful user, who successful

81
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.450 
means the user that gets his
block as a block created by him

82
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:21.980 
into the longest chain that he gets paid
by coins from this coinbase transactions.

83
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.590 
Last but not least we would like
to have a closer look at the

84
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.940 
structure and content
of the transaction.

85
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.060 
This is what we will
discuss in the next

86
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.000 
in the next clip.

87
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.210 
Let's summarize - the first transaction
in a block is a special transaction

88
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:49.650 
that starts a new coin owned
by the user who creates a block,

89
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.570 
the so called coinbase
transaction.

90
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.970 
And this transaction allows
user to send himself a reward

91
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.810 
in form of a fixed amount of
coins that did not previously

92
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.430 
exist together with the
fees of the transaction

93
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:16.680 
included in the blocks and this is
intensive for him to create such blocks.

94
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.330 
It works well. Bitcoin system
is increasing and increasing

95
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.490 
and if you think on the
current price, the current

96
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.790 
which says about six

97
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.860 
bit coin which can be

98
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.180 
get by producing
a new block and getting this

99
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:44.240 
block into the longest chain, it is
about six times forty thousand, so

100
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.700 
it's a quarter of a million one
can earn with producing a new

101
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.900 
block.

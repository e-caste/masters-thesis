00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.400 
Welcome to knowledge graphs. This
is a lecture one knowledge

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.310 
graphs in the
web of data.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.780 
In this lecture we are going to
talk about universal knowledge

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.100 
representation.

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.430 
Here you see an example which has been
shown in the previous lectures also -

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.750 
climate change is the everest of
all problems. So here as a human

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.010 
you can already understand the meaning of
everest based on the contextual information.

8
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.940 
As soon as you get more contextual
information the meaning

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.230 
becomes clearer to you.

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.170 
However how this information
can be more explicitly

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.620 
represented so that it is easily
understandable by machines?

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.300 
In order to do so entity disambiguation
and entity mapping techniques can help.

13
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.470 
Everest can mean
many things.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.270 
Everest is a small
village in Kansas,

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.860 
Everest is a gas
field near Scotland,

16
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.830 
Everest is a Surveyor
General of India,

17
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.680 
Jack Everest is an
Irish football player

18
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.150 
and finally mount everest
which is a mountain.

19
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.520 
In this case in order to get the
correct meaning in order to

20
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.270 
interpret the correct meaning of
the word everest disambiguation

21
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.800 
techniques will help.

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
With the help of entity
resolution techniques

23
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.270 
Everest can be connected to the
entity mount Everest which

24
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.720 
is a subclass
of mountain

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.130 
which is in turn is a
subclass of landform

26
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.810 
and finally landform is a
subclass of geographical unit.

27
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.320 
Here it can be divided into two parts -
entities and the class information.

28
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.400 
The meaning of each of these entities and
classes should be explicitly explained

29
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.700 
in these kind of
representations.

30
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.610 
This can also be represented
with the help of set theory.

31
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.440 
So Mount Everest belongs
to a set of mountains,

32
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.000 
mountain is a subset
of landform,

33
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.990 
landform is a subset
of geomorphical unit,

34
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.570 
and geomorphical unit is a subset
of natural geographic object.

35
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.690 
Now George Everest is a person
after who Mount Everest is named

36
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.910 
and now here some of the
restrictions can be enforced that

37
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.960 
a person cannot be a mountain and
a mountain cannot be a person.

38
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.270 
So the intersection between
these two sets is an empty set

39
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.750 
based on which we
can deduce that

40
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.930 
mount everest does not
belong to the set person

41
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.410 
and George Everest does not
belong to the set mountain.

42
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.000 
All of this is represented in
the form of basic set theory

43
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.230 
and the things that we deduce
based on these explanations

44
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
are called the
logical inferences.

45
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.280 
Now let's go back to the example of entities
where mount everest is a mountain,

46
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.030 
it is a tourist attraction, it is
eight thousander and it is a landform.

47
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.940 
And landform is a subclass
of geographical unit

48
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.050 
which is a subclass of natural
geomorphical object.

49
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.200 
Now since Mt. Everest
is a landform and landform

50
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.910 
is a subclass of geomorphical
unit, it can be inferred that

51
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.890 
mount Everest is a
geomorphic unit.

52
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.030 
Since Mount Everest is
a geomorphic unit

53
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.810 
and it is a subclass of natural geographic
object, it can also be inferred

54
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.580 
that Mount Everest is a
natural geographic object.

55
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.630 
similarly landform is a subclass of
natural geographic object.

56
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.850 
Now the entity here mount Everest is a
mountain where mountain is a class.

57
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.470 
Each of these classes can be represented
with the help of several properties.

58
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.620 
So here in this case the class
mountain is represented with

59
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.150 
the help of the property name,
elevation first ascend and namesake.

60
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.120 
Each property always has a
domain and a range. In this case

61
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.660 
all the properties have the domain
which is a class mountain

62
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.620 
and then there are ranges which is
which are either literals or classes.

63
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.060 
So the range of the property
name is a string literal.

64
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.880 
The range of the property
elevation is an integer.

65
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.280 
The range of the property
first ascend is a date time.

66
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.920 
The range of the namesake
is a class which is person.

67
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.710 
Now what is the difference between
knowledge representation

68
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.840 
and the traditional
data structures?

69
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.150 
The mathematical logic behind
this representation actually

70
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.850 
helps in formally
expressing the semantics

71
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.750 
and the semantics of these knowledge
representations can be defined explicitly.

72
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.960 
Based on these
mathematical logic

73
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.130 
it enables us logic to infer and
perform reasoning over these facts.

74
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.770 
This all formalisation can be
connected to the semantic web.

75
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.350 
The semantic web is an
extension of the current web.

76
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.700 
It explicitly represents the
semantics in the form of formal

77
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.580 
formal structured way and
standardized knowledge representation.

78
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.390 
Thereby it will be possible to process
the meaning of the information

79
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.450 
automatically, relate and integrate
the heterogeneous data,

80
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.590 
and deduce implicit information from the
evident information. The semantic web

81
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.130 
is a kind of global database that contains a
universal network of semantic propositions.

82
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.180 
A formal definition of the semantic web
was published in Scientific American

83
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.940 
which says "The Semantic Web is an
extension of the current web

84
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.280 
in which information is
given well-defined meaning

85
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.270 
by better enabling computers and
people to work in cooperation."

86
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.900 
More details on semantic web
will come in the next lecture.

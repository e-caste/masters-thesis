00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.330 
Welcome to this video clip in which we look at the practical aspect of process mining

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.610 
and primarily we look at simulating event locks,

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.314 
so so far our focus was mainly on the concepts

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.698 
and the fundamental concepts and process mining and a number of illustrating small

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.730 
examples. Now the focus is on large, a bit more realistic

6
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.329 
examples using simulated event locks.

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.549 
We thereby also introduce a standard for event locks, which is called

8
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.539 
Outstanding Standing for Extensible Event Stream.

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.240 
And then based on this, we do process discovery and also process enhancement

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.799 
with out and with noise.

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.819 
So we introduce the notion of noise, which is also an important aspect in process

12
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.790 
mining. So what's noise?

13
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.951 
Noise is any deviation of the process of execution from the blueprint

14
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.495 
model. We have already seen in previous examples that the process

15
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.503 
is not always executed exactly as prescribed by

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.400 
the blueprint process model.

17
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.719 
There might be missing events, there might be additional events that might be different

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.549 
orderings in the real world.

19
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.229 
Then what was defined in the model and any deviation

20
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.939 
of the process of execution from the process model we called noise

21
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.800 
and we use noise to represent real world behaviour of business

22
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.959 
processes. And that was one of our starting points where we indicated

23
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.096 
that, well, in the real world, processes are not always executed

24
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.519 
exactly as specified in a blueprint process models.

25
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.079 
All right. So a word on the standard event lock format

26
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.370 
exits or exits as an example format for event

27
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.550 
locks.

28
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.239 
Exits has been initially developed and the prom project as

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.599 
a technical at the technical university in Eindhoven,

30
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.911 
promise an academic process, mining framework and also a technological platform

31
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.295 
with numerous hundreds of plug ins for different functionalities,

32
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.280 
different process mining algorithms.

33
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.279 
And you're invited to take a look at promontories dot org where you'll find

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.439 
loads of information in the process.

35
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.130 
Mining area since 2016

36
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.588 
is also an eye Tripoli standard.

37
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.159 
And you see also the Tripoli standard number and you'll find more

38
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.150 
information about the format on standard

39
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.750 
dot org.

40
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.650 
All right. So in this in this video clip, we briefly discussed how we can simulate

41
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.779 
eventless we use we have a basis

42
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.449 
and the basis is an enriched process model.

43
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.219 
So we start with the process model and we need to set certain

44
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.944 
parameters, simulation parameters, for instance, the number of cases that we

45
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.796 
like to simulate in our in the first part of this online course,

46
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.279 
we just had like 10 or 12 instances.

47
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.661 
And we now can have thousands of instances that we can generate using

48
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.780 
an event like simulator.

49
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.539 
Well, that's the basic basically the thing that we that we put into as this simulation

50
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.099 
parameters. And we use in our example the simulation tools

51
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.602 
that we have developed in recent years in my chair here at

52
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.519 
the institute.

53
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.030 
All right, so on the first event like that, we have simulated

54
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.270 
is based on the process model P one.

55
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.569 
So that was the one that we discovered in our example

56
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.160 
and that was the event log or that's the process model where we

57
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.689 
have these also this incomplete traces.

58
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.479 
Right. So we have this premature ending and we have incomplete traces.

59
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.610 
So in our, let's say, conceptual view,

60
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.894 
we said, well, a particular traces are represented by by

61
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.759 
a sequence of events. And here we have four for the case.

62
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.190 
One, two or three. Six we have two events.

63
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.901 
So receive claim one, two or three, six and check claim completeness,

64
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.139 
one, two, three, six. So that was our abstract.

65
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.080 
If you want academic view on on a trace in excess,

66
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.069 
it looks a bit different or not so

67
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.279 
different if you look closely at that. So if the upper part

68
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.853 
and I can again zoom into that to make it a bit better readable for

69
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160 
us.

70
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.759 
So the upper part, you have information about that particular Excel

71
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.819 
version and encoding that we use.

72
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.170 
We can have comments here.

73
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.239 
And here's where the lock starts. So the lock element tells us exactly where

74
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.499 
the lock starts.

75
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.796 
We have an identifier of the particular process we are

76
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.579 
interested in, and that's just a generated name.

77
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.329 
Here is where we have the Trace's and we just have one trace here.

78
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.320 
And this trace maybe can show you the trace.

79
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.779 
The trace has a name.

80
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.870 
And basically it's the value that we have here.

81
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.519 
Value one, two, three, six. And that corresponds to the claim ID one one,

82
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.579 
two, three, six that we were looking at a bit earlier.

83
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.000 
An event is represented by the event element in this, except our

84
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.480 
document here. We additionally generated or simulated

85
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.621 
resource. So we didn't have the time to look at resources and process mining in

86
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.595 
this short online course.

87
00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.389 
But we have a resource of the clock with a search number has executed this receive

88
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.350 
claim activity. And we have a timestamp.

89
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.060 
And you see here we have a simulation that is from from

90
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.411 
twenty and it was December, December twenty twenty, I guess, where we simulated

91
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.249 
that. Right. And basically what we see here is something very interesting because

92
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.072 
we have a trace and that is a complete trace because the trace starts here and

93
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.720 
ends here.

94
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.290 
We have two events.

95
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.419 
The first one is receive claim and the second one is check claim

96
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.949 
completeness. So what we see in that example is one trace

97
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.029 
is an X file that has a trace that is incomplete.

98
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.872 
So exactly. The trace are C one, two or three, six, C.C.C.

99
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.790 
one, two, three, six. And that could be simulated based on the process model

100
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.466 
we see here where we have RC, CCC and then the process

101
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.290 
can end.

102
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.744 
On the right hand side, we have a little screenshot of part of the X documents so that

103
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.127 
you that you believe me, that we don't just have two or three traces, but we have a

104
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.810 
number of traces. And we as written here, we have three thousand cases

105
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.289 
that we simulated.

106
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.089 
So we have quite a long event logs here to discuss.

107
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.077 
All right, here I have a second trace based on the same simulated process

108
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.899 
model, so we have a trace in which a claim was rejected.

109
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.220 
So that's our see or receive claim for one, two for one

110
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.260 
check claim completeness, one, two for one, and then events for

111
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.782 
this site on claim coverage.

112
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.371 
And we prepare the rejection letter and we sent the rejection letter.

113
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.559 
And here on the right hand side, you can go through it.

114
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.010 
Maybe also in the PDF. I think you can see it quite, quite nicely that we have here

115
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.480 
the events underneath and we see that this

116
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.269 
trace is represented by these.

117
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.430 
Yes. Snippet.

118
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.819 
Finally, we'll also want to introduce a simulation based

119
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.629 
on the model P one, P two, sorry.

120
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.899 
So the trades based on P two.

121
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.079 
We also have three thousand cases. And here's here we have the loop right here in the

122
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.098 
lower part, we discussed the loop already, which is iterated whenever the claim is

123
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.799 
incomplete.

124
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.440 
Right. So when we have an incomplete trail trace, no claim,

125
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.869 
we send an update request, we receive an update, we check again and then

126
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.775 
we iterate until the claim is complete and on the right

127
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.440 
hand side. And I can zoom into that one more time.

128
00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.979 
On the right hand side, you see an X snippet where you have activities

129
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.266 
for receive claim check, claim completeness.

130
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.890 
And obviously the claim is incomplete.

131
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.120 
So we send an update request, we receive

132
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.389 
an update, we receive an update.

133
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.869 
We do check claim completeness again.

134
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.620 
So we have the same type of event for that case.

135
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.999 
And then we can decide on the claim coverage, prepare an approval letter and sent

136
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.539 
approval letter and then the trace terminates as well.

137
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.350 
So that shows that we can also simulate

138
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.929 
loops here so that the traces are a bit longer than the traces has been have

139
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.529 
been before.

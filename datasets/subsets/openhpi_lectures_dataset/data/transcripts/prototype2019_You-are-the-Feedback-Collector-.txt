00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.620 
Hi Jentzen! Thank you so much
for taking the time and coming

2
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.990 
in today. - My pleasure. - So I have an
idea that I have been thinking about

3
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.890 
and I wanted to test it with
you. So this idea is a product

4
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.160 
that will help us to drink tea
at the very right temperature.

5
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
So I've built a prototype, I
want to ask you to test it but

6
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.550 
before we get into testing I
want to tell you that there

7
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
is no right or wrong answer, I'm
curious about your opinion

8
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.650 
so please give me your honest
feedback on it, and I'm

9
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.050 
also gonna be taking
some notes as well

10
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.040 
from your feedback. - Yeah sure. - Okay,
before we start, is there anything

11
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.840 
that you want to share, any
questions that you have?

12
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.980 
No not really - Good.
Alright so I'm gonna pour

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.280 
some water here.

14
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.170 
And give this cup to you and ask you to
tell me what you think? What do you see?

15
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.640 
Well I saw a post-it note
here that says one hundred

16
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.530 
degrees. I can imagine. -
Yes. - The water is warm,

17
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.890 
the cup is warm. Yeah, I think
this would be like an indicator

18
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.730 
of the temperature of the cup or
the water? That I'm not sure.

19
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.190 
Good point - Is it a hundred,
I'm guessing one hundred

20
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.340 
degrees Celsius or it could be
Fahrenheit but I think it makes

21
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.710 
more sense with Celsius, right?
Yeah so a cup that gives

22
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.200 
an indicator of the temperature of
either the cup on the outside

23
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560 
or the liquid inside. -
Right. It's a good point.

24
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.040 
So a bit of time has passed, and
now this is the new temperature.

25
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.050 
So I mean I can tell that now temperature
has dipped to seventy degrees.

26
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.530 
Yeah but seventy degrees, I
think it's still too hot.

27
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.600 
Yeah? So you wouldn't drink it?- I
mean I wouldn't drink it right away.

28
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.850 
I probably want to touch the
cup, test a little bit,

29
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.690 
I probably would like to
blow again. - Why is that?

30
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.270 
I mean it doesn't tell
me whether seventy

31
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.640 
degrees is still gonna
burn my tongue or not?

32
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.220 
I'm not sure what is the right temperature
to start drinking it. - Okay.

33
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.450 
So what is missing for you? How
would you like to see this

34
00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:01.000 
being communicated with you? - Um,
hm! Well I think at the top of

35
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.520 
my mind I would first have to know
what is the right temperature,

36
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.710 
right, if it's seventy degrees, I
have to learn that from somewhere.

37
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.190 
Or it could be a simple
one that could

38
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.760 
be just a smiley face for example,
that this is the right temperature

39
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.210 
for lets say an adult male to
really start consuming, whatever

40
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.830 
that is in this cup. Or a sad
face when it's still too hot.

41
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.020 
Yeah interesting. So you would
like to actually see it being

42
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.930 
visually communicated, very simple,
smiley or sad face? - Yeah.

43
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.200 
I guess that would help.
At least for me.

44
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.220 
Thanks, is there anything
that you would like to add?

45
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.350 
No, I guess that's it.

46
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.160 
Thank you so much, that
was very valuable and

47
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.720 
for the next iterations, if you
have time I would definitely

48
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.810 
like to test it with you. -
Yeah, please do. - Thanks!

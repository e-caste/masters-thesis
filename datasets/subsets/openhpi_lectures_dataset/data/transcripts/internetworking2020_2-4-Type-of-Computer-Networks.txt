00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.740 
we now consider different
types of computer networks.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.410 
Computer networks can be classified
according to various different aspects.

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.470 
For example they can be classified
with respect to spatial extension,

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.360 
they can be classified according to the
task and operational characteristics,

6
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.340 
they can be classified according to
condition and connection types.

7
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.680 
Let's start with the classification
by a spatial extent.

8
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.700 
So for example if you look to the
computer circuits and systems

9
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.320 
we can already speak of a network.
So a multi processor system

10
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.940 
there the spatial extent is
in the millimeter area,

11
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.580 
for example is so called the circuit
board is something that's different

12
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.560 
by the different processes. They
want to exchange information.

13
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.730 
Or we if we look to body
processor system clusters,

14
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.430 
then we come into the range of a
meter or something about it.

15
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.940 
If we look to the extension of a
room then we speak of a personal

16
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.420 
area network, of PAN. When we consider
an extension of about one kilometer

17
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.180 
then it's a building or it's a campus.
Then we have a local area network.

18
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.950 
Local area networks are most
a popular type of network.

19
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.160 
If we look to a larger extensions,
for example in the area of

20
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.240 
some dozen of kilometer then we are in the
city and we speak about metropolitan

21
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.920 
area networks in the extension radius
of hundred to thousand kilometres

22
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.620 
covering a country or even a continent.
We speak of wide area network

23
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.910 
WANS. We have to look so once because
of principle to route the data

24
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.250 
in such WAN. This is used in the
internet. And if you look to the planet

25
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.930 
then we have
the internet.

26
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.950 
So this is a classification
according to extension. We also

27
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.120 
can do a classification of
networks based on the coverage.

28
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:54.470 
So we can consider local networks,
then we can BAN or a wireless BAN.

29
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.460 
BAN is body area network. It'll
become more and more important in

30
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.670 
future with the watch and the
smartphone and some wearables.

31
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.960 
We can consider the PAN or the
wireless PAN, personal area network.

32
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.410 
So this around in a room and
then we can consider our local

33
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.480 
area networks going over a
couple of hundred meters.

34
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.290 
Of course for each such type of
networks other technologies

35
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.380 
are used. For example in a PAN, it's
possible to work with infrared

36
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.780 
or a long distance like we see
it in the local area network

37
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.990 
it makes no sense to use
such type of technology.

38
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.390 
If we look to the non local
networks then we have the

39
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.500 
metropolitan area networks
or the wide area networks.

40
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.080 
There are global area networks. We
also have virtual private networks.

41
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.250 
This VPNs and which play
an important role if you

42
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.310 
want to connect in a secure
way with your company

43
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.370 
even a long distance, or we can
consider storage area networks.

44
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.290 
And the last type of classification
that's very common

45
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.990 
is according to the task such a
network has to fulfill. So network

46
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.020 
can fulfil can work a
functional group. So

47
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.940 
it can connect computer or special computers
with special peripheral equipment

48
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.530 
or special databases which are
exactly formed to fulfill

49
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.880 
a certain specific target. Or we can
consider such a load grouping.

50
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:55.680 
So a load balancing that guarantees
that network which also

51
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.640 
sets a different computers that are
interconnected in the network are

52
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.060 
balanced in the power
and in the in the

53
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.400 
power and in the performance I
have to provide, or data network

54
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.490 
which connect system with
specific databases.

55
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:22.560 
Very often we see security networks. So
it's guaranteed if when the system fails,

56
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.140 
that the system the connection as
a connected system can continue

57
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.610 
to work that another system takes
over its function and others.

58
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.540 
We can also classify by nature
of the types of devices that

59
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.080 
are interconnected in such a
network. So we can distinguish

60
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.150 
homogeneous or inhomogeneous
computer networks whether all

61
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.430 
hosts are of the same or whether
they are of different types.

62
00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.350 
We can distinguish public computer
networks and private computer network.

63
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.740 
Whether there is public access
for everyone or whether

64
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.040 
there is an excess only for
a specific group of users.

65
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.090 
I already mentioned this virtual private
networks which is internet based

66
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:25.050 
and provides the behavior of a private
network by means of security technologies.

67
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.360 
So you see there are different
types of computer. There is not

68
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.240 
types of computer networks, there
is not a computer networks one

69
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.370 
size fits all. So for various
special application

70
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.330 
types with distances we have
different computer networks.

71
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.080 
So it becomes understandable that
with the internet we want to form

72
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.260 
a huge virtual homogeneous network
by interconnecting all this

73
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.230 
different networks internet as a
network of computer networks.

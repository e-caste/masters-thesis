00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.940 
Now let's speak about e-mail in our openHPI
course- A Half Century of Internet

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.260 
everyone knows e-mail, so e-mail was the
first killer application in the internet

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.340 
so, everyone from us
received or sent an e-mail

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
"e" for electronic; so, e-mail
programs are used originally

5
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.440 
they were only installed on computers
as a fixed application meanwhile

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.340 
we can find e-mail programs for
almost all end devices so we

7
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.570 
have it on the smartphone, on a tablet,
on each device that's interesting

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.520 
so please discuss in our discussion
forum what you experience

9
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.740 
with your e-mail program? What
e-mail program you are using?

10
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.120 
here are some common e-mail
programs, so for different

11
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.260 
platforms there are different
programs in place and popular

12
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.440 
if you look to the Windows and to the
Mac platform that Microsoft Outlook

13
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
is a very popular e-mail program,
some special features to

14
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.940 
mention are that there is also
an appointment management

15
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
on all platforms, there is a Mozilla
Thunderbird e-mail program available

16
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.760 
it is open source which is an
important characteristic

17
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.530 
so for the usage and without
having to pay for the license

18
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.220 
on the Mac systems,
there is Apple mail

19
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.380 
on UNIX systems there is a mail
program which is in place for

20
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.130 
many many years from the first
days of the internet from 1970

21
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.720 
and it's working
common landlines

22
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.560 
on Android systems, there is Gmail
available; in iOS, Mail program

23
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.490 
so, I am quite sure that you use one or
the other of those mentioned programs

24
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.410 
in addition to the e-mail programs that
are installed and running on the device

25
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.330 
there are also e-mail services like
Google Mail, Outlook and Yahoo

26
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
so, e-mail programs like Outlook,
Thunderbird, Apple Mail are applications

27
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.850 
are applications on computers
and these applications use the

28
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.300 
internet for their
communications

29
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.220 
in most cases this e-mail services
are web applications that

30
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.280 
means they are accessible via the web,
they are accessible by means of

31
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.430 
the browser. So, here are some
services like AOL, Freenet, Gmail

32
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.220 
GMX, Hotmail and others which
provides storage space for e-mails

33
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.080 
which provide special features
for such web e-mails that

34
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.540 
are available as web applications.
These different offers differ in the

35
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.360 
amount of space that are
available with some other

36
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.590 
features are provided

37
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.190 
for this e-mail
web application

38
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.250 
if you look to the history of e-mail,
then the electronic mail was

39
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.340 
possible already
in the ARPANET

40
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.090 
I mentioned in the introductory
clip of this week that it

41
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.750 
was introduced in 1971, it was
introduced by Ray Tomlinson

42
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.310 
and it became the first killer
application of the internet.

43
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.940 
So, e-mail also today is the most
widely used means of communication

44
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.420 
worldwide 4 billion e-mail users,
280 billion e-mails sent

45
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.700 
per day and 1.75 e-mail
accounts per e-mail user

46
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.270 
so, most e-mail users have
more than one account

47
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.030 
and also here over time, the number
of sent and received e-mails

48
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.240 
per day are increasing
from 2017

49
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.990 
with 269 billion of
e-mail every day

50
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.480 
for today, 306 billion
and this will increase

51
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.340 
also in the next year.

52
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.480 
The e-mail is easy to
understand because it

53
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.830 
provides an analogy for
the conventional mail.

54
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.850 
So, the conventional mail has an
envelope, in the envelope you

55
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.540 
have to write the receiver, then
there is from the message from

56
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.130 
the letter, there is a header,
typically it's a sender and then

57
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.370 
we have the message itself and if you
compare this to the e-mail or the e-mail

58
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:41.590 
has a kind for the address space
something similar like an e-mail

59
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.420 
better to see the analogue of
a postcard. So, in a post

60
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.000 
card it's open there
is addressee written

61
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.890 
then the from who sent this e-mail
and then the message is provided.

62
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.480 
What is the e-mail address? How it's
organized? And you know this of course

63
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.620 
the sender and recipients of a message,
they are identified for the e-mail service

64
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.220 
by means of the e-mail address and this
is an example of an e-mail address.

65
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.220 
The e-mail address consists of the
name so-called the username which

66
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:31.320 
is the name of the mailbox
that is assigned to the

67
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.080 
the receiver or to the sender,
then we have the delimiter

68
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.410 
and then we have the server
address, the domain name of the

69
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.290 
or it could also be an IP address
of the sender or the recipient

70
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.540 
on which the e-mail
server is installed.

71
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.590 
What components are needed
for an e-mail system?

72
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.870 
Of course, the internet is needed
because it is a transport media

73
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.870 
we have a need
so-called user agent

74
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.480 
and we need a Message
Transfer Agent

75
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.120 
and we need a protocol, you know, each
application that wants to use the internet

76
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.660 
a transport service needs a
protocol in the application layer

77
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.440 
this is in case of e-mails the SMTP
protocols - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

78
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.320 
and this protocol controls how
the message is transmitted.

79
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.640 
So, here we have a
Message Transfer Agent

80
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:51.270 
there we have a Message Transfer Agent
and to transport such a message

81
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:58.260 
the SMTP protocol works in the
following way - it starts with

82
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:04.680 
with a HELLO message, then the recipient's
MTA (Message Transfer Agent)

83
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.580 
answered back that it is available
and then the Message Transfer Agent

84
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:17.610 
A tells I have to transmit a mail
from christoph.meinel@hpi.de

85
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:25.520 
then the service says, ok.
Then it needs to be sent

86
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.810 
that the e-mail from christoph.meinel@hpi.de
needs to send to Bob

87
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.750 
at Technical University Munich. The server
says, Ok, I understood this, then the

88
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.780 
then the data are sent, the e-mail
sent to the Message Transfer Agent

89
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.310 
here and it answers after
transmission, Ok, I got it

90
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:59.590 
so this is how the SMTP protocol
is working then it quits

91
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.810 
and this is the way how many
Message Transfer Agents

92
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:12.420 
between the User 1 and
User 2 are existing

93
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.020 
and helping to forward the
e-mail from User A to User B.

94
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.980 
So, here every time between
this Message Transfer Agent

95
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:30.960 
we have this what I showed in the slide
before we have this SMTP protocol

96
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.850 
and the interactions which are
controlled by this protocol.

97
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.190 
So, when the e-mail systems
start we have a user agent

98
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.220 
and provides a possibility that the mail
can be written and can be addressed

99
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.470 
then it's hand over to the
Message Transfer Agent and the

100
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.030 
Message Transfer Agent systems, they
take care that message is transported

101
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.520 
over a number of Message Transfer
Agent up to the Message

102
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.340 
Transfer Agent of the receiver
and the receiver hands over the

103
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:12.720 
e-mail to the User 2 and then User 2
can read it. So, let's look again

104
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:18.620 
the path is determined and then the
mails are sent along this path

105
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:25.090 
to User 2. It's really surprising in
which short time such a complicated

106
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.850 
transport service
is working

107
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.160 
So, I mentioned the e-mail is a
very old service on the internet

108
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:48.020 
it is one of the first services and the
SMTP protocol is a corresponding a very

109
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.960 
is simple structured

110
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:58.940 
So, SMTP allows only the transport
of alphanumeric characters

111
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.220 
in the early times of the internet
it was completely enough but

112
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:09.320 
today you remember we want to
send a photo with an e-mail

113
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:15.760 
we want to send a slide or
a music per e-mail but not

114
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.790 
possible with the SMTP protocol. SMTP
protocol only allows alphanumeric character

115
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.880 
What is a solution? One solution
would have been in the past

116
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.770 
to design a new protocol for this
new types of data according

117
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.580 
we use today. The other way and
this was realized in internet is

118
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.360 
that the other information types
- Graphics, Photos, Videos

119
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:47.810 
need to be translated into
alphanumeric characters before, say,

120
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.800 
I'll send by means of
the SMTP protocol

121
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.280 
and the standard for this translation
is a MIME standard - Multi-purpose

122
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.420 
Internet Mail Extension

123
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.860 
In MIME standard you can give in
some of the other data types

124
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.860 
and MIME takes care and tells
how this is to be translated

125
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.300 
into characters

126
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:14.860 
alphanumeric characters

127
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:23.230 
So, it extends the file format of e-mails
and enables different file types

128
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:29.940 
to be sent, for example, audio,
photo, also computer programs

129
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:35.900 
a code can be sent. So, what is
important that this MIME standard

130
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:44.380 
provides means for this encoding
as well as to provide mechanisms

131
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.470 
to separate different
components in the e-mail

132
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:53.090 
so, this is also called as multi-part
e-mails because you remember, you can send

133
00:12:53.220 --> 00:13:00.970 
within one e-mail a photo and music, a
piece of music or video or other things

134
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.100 
and of course
the receiver

135
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:10.980 
who gets this alphanumeric characters
which encodes other data types

136
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.790 
needs to be
able to read

137
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:22.550 
to decode these characters and get
out the different file types

138
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:29.440 
which tell the system of the
receiver that this is audio and

139
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:35.070 
I need an audio encoder or this is a
video and you need to be able to

140
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.230 
consume this in a
video encoder

141
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.020 
Let's have a look
to e-mail gateways

142
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:51.200 
So, in a Local Area Network, usually,
there is only one dedicated post office

143
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:57.170 
a post office for all the computers
connected to the Local Area Network

144
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.370 
you remember, the Local Area
Networks, for example, internet was

145
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.630 
was a broadcast
principle of

146
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:12.750 
distributing information and there
is one so-called E-mail Gateway

147
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:21.230 
one post office that able to receive
e-mails and to provide possibilities

148
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.250 
that members or users of this
Local Area Network can access

149
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:33.440 
the post office
and can get

150
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.160 
the e-mail which
are sent to them

151
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.350 
So, the E-mail Gateway is an
intermediate system in the e-mail

152
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.140 
communication

153
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:52.540 
Gateways communicate with each other
directly while the SMTP protocols

154
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.710 
they interact also with
the SMTP protocols

155
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.430 
but for the user that wants
to access the gateway

156
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.390 
the entity from the
different end devices

157
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:13.620 
they need other protocols to access
the gateway to see whether

158
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:20.960 
there is a postbox and to access
the e-mails from their post box

159
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.890 
and there are two protocols in
place for this communication

160
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:30.570 
POP3 and IMAP. POP3 is called
the first Post Office

161
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:36.200 
Protocol. It was really the first one and
this post office protocol regulates

162
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.940 
registration of a user at E-mail
Gateways and the E-mail Gateway

163
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:51.280 
will install a mailbox
for the user

164
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.750 
POP3 protocol provides the
possibility to retrieve

165
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.780 
an e-mail message from the
user's e-mail account, it could

166
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.950 
delete the requested e-mail
messages from the memory

167
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.950 
of the E-mail Gateway, it
copies the user's e-mail from

168
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:18.860 
the gateway, from
the mailbox to the

169
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.300 
the local computer or
to the device like a

170
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.480 
smartphone and then it provides the
possibility to pre-select e-mails

171
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:35.390 
in an account but
what's not possible

172
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:42.030 
is to excess in parallel
several e-mail accounts

173
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.230 
For using and accessing
the E-mail Gateway

174
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:54.390 
the POP3 protocol is used then the e-mail
is taken out of the E-mail Gateway

175
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.160 
to a local device of the
user but typically today,

176
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:04.010 
the users have different
devices. They have the laptop

177
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.900 
at home, they have a smartphone and
they want to access sometimes

178
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.720 
e-mail on the computer, sometimes
e-mail on the smartphone and

179
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.280 
this is not possible with
POP3 because it's only

180
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:23.010 
stored on one device of users.
With the IMAP protocol,

181
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:28.560 
the modern post office protocol,
a protocol is provided so

182
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.180 
the main difference to the
POP3 protocol is that it

183
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:39.520 
allows the access to the mailbox with
different devices for one user

184
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.340 
So, the same mailbox can be accessed
sometimes with a computer

185
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.310 
sometimes with a smartphone,
sometimes with a laptop

186
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.440 
and allowing this

187
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:58.830 
it's no more possible to
transfer from the gateway

188
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.280 
E-mail Gateway mailed to
one device of the user

189
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:10.420 
for such kind of approach, the
e-mails need to stay with a

190
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:16.330 
E-mail Gateway. So, what if
one wants to see whether one

191
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:23.110 
has an e-mail? What is done is the
device connects to the E-mail Gateway

192
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.760 
and then a list is
transferred to the device

193
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.750 
of the e-mails and only in the
moment the user wants to decide

194
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:40.280 
so I want to access this e-mail,
send a copy of this e-mail

195
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.150 
transferred to the device of
the user. User can see the

196
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:50.880 
e-mail, the user can answer but
the mails stay with a gateway

197
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:56.760 
and with central storage which
is provided for all the mails

198
00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:02.450 
for all the post boxes or the
mailboxes of the registered users

199
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:09.050 
So, e-mails that have marked as read are
also marked as read on other devices

200
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:15.180 
so, if next time you go with
a laptop to your post box

201
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.090 
one can see this e-mail I have
already seen and answers

202
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:27.040 
There is a folder structure which
is possible on the e-mail server

203
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:35.380 
which can be used by means of this IMAP
protocol, the second protocol which regulates

204
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:40.540 
how a user accesses
its mailbox

205
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:50.220 
Now, we can see in more
detail the analogy between

206
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.240 
the e-mail dispatch and
the traditional post

207
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:58.150 
Traditional post - user brings
the letter to a post office

208
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.590 
there are many post offices in the
country, so the letter is brought

209
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.570 
from post office to post office
until it reaches its destination

210
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.960 
So, a different post office could
be reached by car or by train

211
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:20.680 
or by plane and it is provided to
the post office which is close

212
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:27.860 
to the recipient of that mail.
So, from that post office

213
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:33.540 
the last mile is done by a
delivery service that brings the

214
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.730 
letter of the user to the
letter boxes of the user.

215
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:43.910 
This is a traditional way how
our post is working and

216
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.750 
if we look to the e-mail, since, quite
similar, so the user creates an e-mail

217
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.480 
in his user agent on
one of its computers

218
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.910 
and then the e-mail is sent
to the E-mail Gateway

219
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.730 
The E-mail Gateway has something
like a role, plays a role

220
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.370 
of the post office
of the first post

221
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:14.610 
box where the user start
to send its letter

222
00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:20.560 
and one can use for this kind
of communication as well POP3

223
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:25.370 
or the IMAP protocol and then
over the Message Transfer Agent

224
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:32.570 
Message Transfer Agency
system, the mail is brought

225
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:37.810 
here as communication is organized
over the internet brought to the

226
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:46.730 
gateway to the E-mail Gateway where the
recipient has its mailbox and then

227
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:52.200 
last mile when the receiver
wants to excess his boxes

228
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.810 
mailbox, he can use a POP3 or
he can use IMAP to receive

229
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:04.530 
the mail but the difference
here is if its POP3

230
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:10.690 
the mail is copied out of the
register and then transferred

231
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.540 
to the user and deleted on the
E-mail Gateway and if IMAP is

232
00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:23.500 
used for this last mile, then
the e-mail stays recorded here

233
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.190 
in the E-mail Gateway, only
a copy is transmitted to

234
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:33.190 
the device of the user and then the
recipient can read the e-mail, can do

235
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.840 
can start to write an answer
or something similar

236
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.900 
Let's come back to the e-mail
programs which are the front-end

237
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.240 
for the user side, for using this
e-mail system, for sending an e-mail

238
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.620 
There are several basic functions each
of such e-mail program is providing

239
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.210 
for example, for the
composition of e-mails

240
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:03.570 
for creating a message,
there is a text editor

241
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:09.120 
half automatically creation
of the header information

242
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:16.080 
then there is the transfer component which takes
care for the delivery of this management

243
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.630 
if it's using SMTP or is using
the TCP protocols, a connection

244
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.210 
need to be established, transfer needs
to be organized in this connection

245
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:31.380 
a reporting component is needed for
notification of the delivery process

246
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:38.780 
positive or negative feedback whether
the mail reached its recipient

247
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:44.110 
or not as sometimes or some information
about the error that happens

248
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:51.330 
another component which such an
e-mail program needs is a display

249
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.560 
display component which takes
care for the presentation

250
00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:02.520 
of the delivered message. Here, you remember,
that it's quite complex component

251
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.010 
because by means
of MIME format

252
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:15.130 
the e-mail consists only of alphanumeric
characters but the e-mail content

253
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:20.750 
there is a video, there is a
photo, there is text so for

254
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:26.990 
displaying it in the right way,
all this MIME encoding have

255
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:32.650 
to be decoded and finally, a
disposition is necessary

256
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.690 
to file the delivered message to
delete it and to make others

257
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:43.270 
What is important when
we speak about e-mails

258
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.880 
it is also that we speak
about risk which is caused

259
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:56.820 
in the misuse of e-mails as
attack systems on the internet

260
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:02.460 
Unfortunately, there are a variety
of possibilities, and you

261
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:07.610 
should be very careful using the
e-mail system that you are aware

262
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.840 
of this possibility that some of the
mails are not coming from the person

263
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.780 
which is written as the
addressee, which is

264
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:23.750 
written as a sender, some cyber
attackers are able to manipulate

265
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:30.160 
mail in a way. So, there is a big group
of attacks which is called Phishing

266
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.930 
so there's a lot of phishing mails
these are fraudulent e-mails

267
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.870 
claiming to come from a legitimate
organization, for example,

268
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.650 
from your bank or from another
authority but in reality

269
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:51.450 
they came from cyber attackers
and what's written in such

270
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.750 
phishing e-mails is that they ask
you to give in some user data for

271
00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:02.520 
example, they tell you that their administrators
need to make a correction of your system

272
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:07.220 
please send us your password or
please send us your user data

273
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:12.550 
or what else. So, the
attackers manipulated

274
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:17.360 
mails want to get out some
sensible information which later

275
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.840 
on can be used for an attack, for example,
or new bank account or other things

276
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:33.140 
then another source of
attacks or risks is that

277
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:39.740 
e-mails are used for attacking system
are malicious attachments to an e-mail

278
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:45.960 
so, often e-mail comes with an
attachment and the recipient

279
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.880 
look to the attachment

280
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.690 
there is an information that you
want some money or other things

281
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.190 
and the attention looks
harmless but in the moment

282
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.530 
the attachment
is opened

283
00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.840 
then a virus or worm
or similar malware

284
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:14.270 
are sent and are installed
on your system

285
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:22.570 
E-mail spoofing is another attack. Spoofing
means that the sender address is manipulated

286
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:28.020 
It's not so difficult with the e-mail
system to manipulate the sender address

287
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:34.040 
and the e-mail comes with a
false identity, for example,

288
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:40.090 
they comes from your husband
or from your girlfriend

289
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.530 
and then you believe things which are
written in the e-mail completely

290
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.300 
differently then when it comes
from an unknown person

291
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:55.070 
So, what they want
to get your trust

292
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.390 
to do something wrong
on your computer.

293
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:06.220 
So, this was also a very important
application we spoke about how e-mails

294
00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.250 
are transported through the internet
but we spoke also about the dangers

295
00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:18.350 
around using e-mails which is today
the most often used communication

296
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:23.500 
tool for people

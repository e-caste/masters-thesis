1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.920 
Ok Tom we, have seen video communication,
synchronous communication.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.670 
What else do we have in
synchronous communication?

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.070 
So, one of the one of the main
other tools that we use

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.400 
there, is a text chat. Direct
immediate text chat.

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.180 
Advantages of these
tools, and you

6
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.570 
always have to ask advantages
compared to what?

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.900 
So, compared to the video
for example they are

8
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.930 
way quicker, they were
easier to use, lightweight

9
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.450 
it's a very lightweight communication
channel you can you can

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.540 
have it running all the time in the
background, it doesn't listen

11
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.390 
to you, you need to
type something in,

12
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.270 
and you can for example
have private chats

13
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.690 
with one other person, or
in a group, or you can

14
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.380 
define topic related
channels, so that you can

15
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.270 
predefine who
is or will be

16
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.830 
interested in certain
sub-aspects of the teamwork.

17
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.080 
E.g. put all the administrators in a
group, and maybe you as the team

18
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.190 
leader are in there as well
so that you can at least

19
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.060 
see what's going on or

20
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.090 
maybe just the front
and developers,

21
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.610 
whatever is going on. You
don't want to mix up things

22
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.200 
and you can clearly define
who's talking about what. OK.

23
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.070 
You can channel that. You
can see the online status,

24
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.030 
who is right
now there.

25
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.510 
As a participant, as a
user, you have the

26
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.890 
possibility to turn this off or
on, set your online status

27
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.550 
as you want. So you can go, still
can go online without everybody

28
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.400 
knowing that you're online, but
you need to do that actively.

29
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.130 
These tools are often also working
very good with a with mobiles,

30
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.360 
mobile phones, so you have
them with you all the time,

31
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.580 
Which normally is an
advantage, but can also

32
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.660 
become some sort of
stress factor.

33
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.450 
They are way less intrusive
[than video chats], so,

34
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.050 
nobody sees what what's going on in
your back and nobody listens to

35
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.380 
what's going on... And you
don't have this huge traffic

36
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.880 
that you had for the
video, this bandwidth.

37
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.240 
Yeah it works way better
also in low bandwidth

38
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.290 
situations. Of
course, as I said,

39
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.080 
it's not as strong a communication
channel as the video.

40
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.970 
So, it's more narrow, so you only
have what you type there, you

41
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.080 
don't see the facial expressions,
you don't see any gestures....

42
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.750 
This kind of communication
should not replace

43
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.940 
the other one? No it's it's an
additional channel. So, it really

44
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.740 
depends on for what you use
it. So, as we said for

45
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.550 
the videos: use them for meetings
that you have scheduled

46
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.050 
anyway, at certain
slots in time.

47
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.630 
The synchronous a text
communication is

48
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.180 
very well
supporting this

49
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.650 
for the time in-between. Ok, so
when you just like want to type

50
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.880 
someone, chat with
someone like

51
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.450 
what you would talk
about in the office.

52
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.510 
Like I have a small
problem, I don't need a

53
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.420 
video chat for that, or you can
schedule a video chat using

54
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.460 
the text chat, and say, well
I have this problem and

55
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.380 
I really would like to show that
to you on the video. Can you

56
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.170 
come online for this
kind of communication.

57
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.170 
Again, there are a lot
of tools available.

58
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.050 
And we have he
made similar

59
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.400 
categorization for them. So you
have the cloud solutions,

60
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.760 
and you have the on-premise solutions.
That I have to install myself

61
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.140 
on my servers, who one will read,
or? I mean, yeah if they're

62
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.650 
configured properly, I mean
you still need an expert

63
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.640 
to do that, to set it up properly.
Then it's on your premises

64
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.760 
on your servers and then
it's your control.

65
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.650 
If you're using a cloud
solutions you have the same

66
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
or similar issues and
with the videos, so

67
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.310 
you never know who's reading,
and you have free plans

68
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.360 
and you have paid plans. One
big issue with the free

69
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.080 
plans is that you have in many
of these solutions you have

70
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.650 
a limited number of
of the logging

71
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.550 
so at some point they throw away the
old logs of your conversation.

72
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.710 
That information from
last month, let's say?

73
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.660 
For example, is gone,
and then you cannot

74
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.750 
you can't go back there
and check why certain

75
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.830 
decisions have been made, why
certain things have been done.

76
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.620 
All this information
will be gone, so you

77
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.720 
need either to do your
own backups somehow,

78
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.170 
or you just use
something else.

79
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.770 
Go to a paid plan,
for example.

80
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.380 
With the paid plan, the logs will remain
for longer time probably? Depending

81
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.910 
on how much you
pay for it.

82
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.590 
You have the same issues
that you have with the

83
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.370 
video chats, free video chats you have
a limited number of participants,

84
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.080 
stuff like that. It's pretty
much the same there.

85
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.310 
A couple of the tools
that we've been using

86
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.290 
Slack, for example, is a
very popular tool, used to

87
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.370 
be a very popular tool
in any recent time.

88
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.350 
WhatsApp, everybody knows it, I
wouldn't use it, actually,

89
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.650 
at least not for for
business purposes.

90
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.740 
I mean it's a
just because,

91
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.180 
because it is as big as it is,
it's kind of an inviting

92
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.590 
target for hackers and
for attackers to

93
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.180 
to get information.
Just because

94
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.770 
of the huge amount of
users that they have.

95
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.820 
So, the only the other
option would be self-

96
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.750 
hosted solutions, we talked
about that already.

97
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.690 
I mentioned that in the beginning
a little bit, so you have

98
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.790 
full control there, you have unlimited access
to all the stuff (logs, participants, etc.),

99
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.240 
because it's running on your own
servers. You can personalize it,

100
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.470 
to your image, to the corporate
image? Sure, you can can do that,

101
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.340 
as well. But then
you need to take

102
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.340 
care about it, so you need to set it
up, you need to do the maintenance,

103
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.720 
so, you need to have someone
to take care of it.

104
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.360 
And that should be someone who
knows what he or she is doing.

105
00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:02.780 
Well Tom, you've shown
us another alternative

106
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.470 
for synchronous communication
that is not a replacement of

107
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.690 
the video chat. It is more on
the go, I think everyone

108
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.480 
is using it right now. Chatting
systems WhatsApp, or whatever

109
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.400 
they're called, but this is an
alternative, a pretty nice alternative

110
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.530 
for a quick response. Whenever
you need information.

111
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.940 
Probably, the community out there will have also experience with
more tools and you are welcome to share with us all of this.

112
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
with more tools and you are welcome
to share with us as always.

113
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.050 
We will definitely be discussing
these topics later on.

114
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.010 
Thank you, Tom.
Thank you, Salim.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.359 
So welcome to this coffee talk session for our open HPI

2
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.219 
course, Digital

3
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.199 
Entrepreneurship. With

4
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.179 
this course we aim to introduce students to the world of digital entrepreneurship

5
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.959 
with an emphasis on

6
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.849 
entrepreneurship research.

7
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.060 
We are extremely happy to have today with us

8
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.719 
one of the, I would say, most famous entrepreneurship scholars

9
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.139 
and an advocate for the relevance of entrepreneurship research with us, Professor

10
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
Norris Krueger from the United States.

11
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.719 
And we are

12
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.101 
really eager to learn about your perspective on the state of science,

13
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.920 
of entrepreneurship, scholarship and research.

14
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.340 
And I hope you have

15
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.020 
your coffee or

16
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.580 
tea ready. I think I spotted that before.

17
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.099 
So let's get

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.480 
into it.

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.730 
And your questions.

20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.359 


21
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.319 
Excellent.

22
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.639 
So could I please ask you to introduce yourself?

23
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.650 
Hi, I am Norris Krueger, I'm currently living in Boise, Idaho,

24
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.769 
in the

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.249 
Pacific Northwest. I'm a recovering tech entrepreneur, entrepreneurship

26
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.059 
educator and scholar.

27
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.416 
I've worn many hats. I still wear many hats.

28
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.621 
I'm still active in research.

29
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.519 
I focus on entrepreneurial thinking and entrepreneurial ecosystems.

30
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.470 
A little of that today of the former, a little more of the latter.

31
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.990 
But I'm also very

32
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.559 
actively

33
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560 
involved in

34
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.469 
helping communities to grow their entrepreneurial communities and

35
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.579 
fending off the biologists who hate that we use the word ecosystem.

36
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.019 
Well, thank you so much. So I have got to know you

37
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.029 
as one of really only a few people who know

38
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.950 
how to bridge science ,

39
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.889 
research ,

40
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.654 
and practice. I mean, as you already

41
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.759 
pointed out, this is kind of what you do.

42
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.110 
But what I've

43
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.759 
found is that not many people in our profession actually know how

44
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.570 
to talk both languages.

45
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.820 
So what made you come from being a

46
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.130 
tech entrepreneur

47
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.059 
and a move

48
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.060 
into the research academic world?

49
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.860 
Well, currently

50
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.140 
there is a

51
00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.649 
complicated backstory, but primarily

52
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.990 
I was an accidental entrepreneur, I was hired

53
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560 
by

54
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.769 
I had been working for an investment banking

55
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.770 
firm and my

56
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.025 
boss, I lost my job because my boss hung out at his own

57
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.690 
shingle. He went out

58
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.819 
on his own. I didn't know what the word entrepreneur meant at the time.

59
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.529 
Then I went to work for the tech firm

60
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.580 
and I didn't know I was being hired to be the acting CEO.

61
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.610 
This is how, surprised

62
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.470 
It was like, no, I shouldn't sit at the head of the table.

63
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.279 
But it was easily addressed.

64
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.646 
It turned out that there are problems, I got

65
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.740 
very lucky. But when that

66
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.342 
ran its course along the way, I had met the new chaired professor of

67
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.319 
entrepreneurship at

68
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.000 
the Ohio State University, the late great Al Shapiro, who

69
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.530 
put out the hook and reeled me into to become a graduate student.

70
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.344 
And that was fascinating with working with one

71
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.314 
of the founders of the academic field and getting to do things like being at

72
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.729 
this large, very large, powerful research university.

73
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.759 
That was quite a blessing. And I had to go do a semester's

74
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.671 
internship with a venture capital firm that was attached to

75
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.119 
one of the world's largest

76
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.580 
research institutes that happened to be across the street from Ohio State.

77
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.759 
Yes, I had to go and hang out with the BCS for a while back before anyone heard

78
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.553 
the words business model. Everyone would be reading these

79
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.970 
ponderous

80
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.899 
business plans. Right. And that was part of my job was to read

81
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.300 
all the crappy ones, basically. All the ones that came in unsolicited.

82
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.949 
Well, it turned out every big investment they had had come

83
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.322 
out of that pile. And then a

84
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.369 
friend of mine who worked in the publishing industry said, oh, the top 10

85
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.179 
best selling books in any country came out of that crap pile

86
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.429 
and said most upcoming, if they have a track record already or I guess

87
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.970 
referred by a by somebody important.

88
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.379 
But the reality is that

89
00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.939 
it took

90
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.139 
about the 20th person to look at 'Gone With the Wind' before

91
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.400 
someone said, you know, this is my yeah, it's worth  a

92
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.309 
chance. And then became the best selling book of the 20th century.

93
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.699 
And it's fascinating because it sort of opened the door to understanding

94
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.189 
a lot about, it's not that

95
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.429 
it was luck involved, but you have

96
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.430 
to you need to

97
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.319 
have the

98
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320 
tools you get the

99
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.100 
opportunity to move forward in a way

100
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.830 
it doesn't screw up

101
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.269 
that at least did not. And I think this new sort of experimental

102
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.109 
science

103
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.188 
model was, Steve Blank

104
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.489 
likes to call it really does have

105
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.809 
a tremendous impact when it's done well,

106
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.348 
and that's sort of the caveat for a lot of things in

107
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.939 
life.

108
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.940 
AB testing

109
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.899 
works. So I

110
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.369 
feel like my life is the resultant vector of all these other things that are

111
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.120 
coming together,

112
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.830 
that

113
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.649 
being able to see the practise side, being able to see the educator side, to be able to

114
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.689 
see the scholar side

115
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.709 
and see the

116
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.249 
community side can get very confusing.

117
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.079 
But I get to see the connections that maybe I'm fortunate that

118
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.349 
other

119
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.820 
people don't see.

120
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.379 
And one of the things that runs through all of that is,

121
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.399 
yes,

122
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.899 
it's good to have expertise.

123
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.039 
And it's good to put in the work however you deserve.

124
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.160 
I agree.

125
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.167 
However, I mean, you also just mentioned the question is always

126
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.609 
how do we actually apply it? Right.

127
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.120 
So it's not the amount of work we have, but rather how we apply it.

128
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.959 
Now you have become quite active, for

129
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.339 
example, at the Academy of Management, why what

130
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.999 
I mean, what

131
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000 
is your what's your

132
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.420 
purpose there? What do you

133
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.399 
want to achieve

134
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.213 
with this engagement for the academic

135
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.159 
community? Are you familiar with the

136
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.829 
great Spanish novel Don Quixote?

137
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.230 
Yes.

138
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.170 
But remember, that at least

139
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.480 
half of the time at least it wasn't intentional,

140
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.310 
but he won half the time he got he

141
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.370 
made a difference.

142
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.570 
Right. I mean, and he didn't bail until he.

143
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.230 
return to sanity.

144
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.269 
I'm not sure that's a good

145
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.709 
thing

146
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.379 
to be thinking about, but, it's about because

147
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.970 
I see these connections and I see

148
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.439 
that part of it is just people who, if I want to talk to

149
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.420 
people who are are

150
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.179 
scholars, it is

151
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.899 
nice to be able to talk to them. I'm now at a major university

152
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.730 
that it is nice to, you know, to hobnob with my fellow wizards.

153
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.059 
And it's a chance

154
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.639 
for me now to contribute and do and a lot of it is just connecting people

155
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.459 
and even in this wonderful digital age,

156
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.609 
I

157
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.619 
am staggered when I when two people don't

158
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.547 
know each other, who should.

159
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.399 
And so I think a lot of a lot of that is the connecting, and I really enjoy that.

160
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.090 
And the same thing on the research side, it's a chance

161
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.329 
I can nudge people like here. Here's a body

162
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.600 
of theory you should be reading, and they're really happy to hear that.

163
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.146 
Right. Well, and so how you know, so I could

164
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.689 
and then they say like, oh, good, in a month but maybe a month I can get up to speed on

165
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.390 
it like, no, no, we're talking you're going to probably spend a year, year and a half

166
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.939 
immersed in this before you'll really understand it.

167
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.049 
And you can ask the right

168
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320 
questions,

169
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.290 
and they don't want to hear that. But if I can nudge them a little bit in

170
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.609 
that direction.

171
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.599 
But the same thing,

172
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.829 
we have people talking about unfriendly ecosystems who haven't talked to an entrepreneur

173
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.830 
in five years.

174
00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:20.009 
This is

175
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.909 
anthropology, not armchair economics.

176
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.017 
And that bothers people

177
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.859 
because of the

178
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.269 
publish or

179
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.035 
perish model that we have

180
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.100 
now. It is you have

181
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.289 
no choice

182
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.189 
but to publish

183
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.464 
lots of little things that

184
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.540 
don't really matter

185
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.809 
so you can keep your job.

186
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.269 
And that's terribly unfair.

187
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.679 
And it's wasting a lot of intellectual capital, I think, in our

188
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.610 
field. But the younger generation, especially in Europe,

189
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.180 
aren't like that.

190
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.820 
I mean, a lot of them, they.

191
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:55.929 
They realised,

192
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.339 
OK, I got to do this stuff to get

193
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.340 
published.

194
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.799 
And I still want to go after the big

195
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.025 
questions and, oh, by the

196
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.761 
way, I'm going to go talk to spend time talking to Entrepreneurs.

197
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.059 
But that's the thing that occasionally comes out of

198
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.611 
conferences, is you're just in the hallway in the pub,

199
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.169 
and you have that, you're talking

200
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.099 
about stuff

201
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.305 
and then all of a sudden they're like Oh, I could write that down.

202
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.340 
We find that that moment

203
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.499 
of

204
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.900 
this enlightenment, probably a great question.

205
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.294 
Yeah, but that's the thing

206
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.932 
I wish more people would do is, is don't talk to

207
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.269 
the same people all the time.

208
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.759 
And we live in a world where

209
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.200 
that's become facilitate, we

210
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.740 
become good at getting better, at communicating online

211
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.150 
with groups of people.

212
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.340 
But the other piece of it is if you get a great idea, you still have to test it.

213
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.539 
Right.

214
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.030 
And to so many brilliant theories that fail.

215
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.179 
And to jump back to what you said before, I agree with you that I think we have

216
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.659 
become quite proficient using the digital tools.

217
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960 
But I also

218
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.749 
think that they

219
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.769 
actually let us stay closer to the people

220
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.999 
we know or we feel more comfortable.

221
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.799 
So are you

222
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.080 
afraid or hopeful

223
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.909 
for the future?

224
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.639 
Will we be more open?

225
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640 
Will be will we

226
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.729 
be more

227
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.419 
respectful or taking those

228
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.719 
different ideas in or are we actually closing down?

229
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.119 
I mean, what's what's your perspective on this?

230
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.979 
We still have you make a connection, you still have to follow up on it and

231
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.900 
work at it now. I was starting to laugh because my own family

232
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.380 
is not excited

233
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.980 
about doing Zoom meetings.

234
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.812 
I mean, it's like the jokes, like my sister is going, you're

235
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.300 
muted

236
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.905 
in the middle of it, finally get it down in the wireless crashes.

237
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.429 
I mean, it's just it was like out of a comedy sketch,

238
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.430 
but

239
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.399 
we finally got it working.

240
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.609 
And everyone goes like, how are you doing? Not bad.

241
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.879 
How about you? Not bad.

242
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.159 
It is

243
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.510 
figuring out how to follow up on

244
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:36.959 
those

245
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.960 
communications.

246
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.319 
One thing I've learnt

247
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320 
is because a lot

248
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.080 
of the stuff, whether it's Academy or ICSP or any other group,

249
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.139 
is the digital divide is a problem.

250
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.849 
And some people don't have great bandwidth, not just my sister in Ohio,

251
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.220 
that you have to be patient about that and have a sense of humour.

252
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.706 
And I hope that that's been a good

253
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.246 
thing. But to flip it back to digital entrepreneurship

254
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.346 
is, this is what great digital entrepreneurs

255
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.710 
are doing. That they're connecting people

256
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.809 
to potential customers, potential employees, potential suppliers, other stakeholders.

257
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.009 
We now have

258
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.389 
we can get at this rich web of stakeholders

259
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.390 
that

260
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.148 
we always imagine experts always

261
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:34.329 
say we

262
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.909 
should be talking to.

263
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.309 
You still have to come back and test it. You still like you get a great idea and you

264
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.989 
still have to you have to scientifically test that.

265
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.580 
But it's

266
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.670 
and that's your first

267
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.869 
question is we're

268
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.739 
not always very

269
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.700 
good at this, things like even something

270
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.389 
as simple as AB testing.

271
00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.549 
Right. Right. And that I mean, that actually does make the difference,

272
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.609 
right. Between the successful and the unsuccessful entrepreneurs.

273
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.510 
And it's also that difference that actually then.

274
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.909 
Yeah, because so many entrepreneurs are students asking

275
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.879 
myself, well, you know, I have this great idea, but I can't talk about it because

276
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.052 
someone is going to steal it. I'm like, no, you know, that is really nonsense.

277
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.540 
Just talk about it.

278
00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:27.489 
You have an idea, go talk to an intellectual property attorney, somebody with expertise

279
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.629 
in that, and they'll say, oh, don't

280
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.630 
worry about that.

281
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.789 
In the US there is a situation where if

282
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.679 
someone wants to invalidate

283
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.905 
your patent, they go find

284
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.159 
out whether you've gone and if you have gone and looked up your idea on

285
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.519 
the US

286
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.110 
Patent Office website

287
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.740 
in the database.

288
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.899 
And that was more than a year before you filed the patent,

289
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.003 
right? You could actually there are some cases where that could be invalidated and that

290
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.146 
seems sort of dumb to let you have someone else, have your

291
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.330 
spouse or your best friend go through looking at that.

292
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.980 
Is that sounds so stupid.

293
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.710 
But the whole

294
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.419 
point is that they can get any legal standing to sue and they have more

295
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.769 
money and more better lawyer than you know that.

296
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.669 
But having said

297
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.840 
that, it is

298
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.940 
that isn't

299
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.099 
about the idea. It's about the execution.

300
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.000 
And this court thing you raised is, If

301
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.750 
you did a survey of management professors, even entrepreneurship professors globally.

302
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.549 
You'd find a frightening percentage would say, no, don't tell anybody.

303
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.780 
And that's a problem, in every

304
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.899 
scientific field, the myths and misconceptions are pervasive.

305
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.295 
And this is again, why that being the scientific,

306
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.629 
I mean, being rigorous,

307
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.669 
and it comes back

308
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.609 
to you got to ask the right questions.

309
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.250 
Yeah, I'll give you a start.

310
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.069 
You're in Europe, so you've never heard it, may not have heard of, there's a very

311
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.679 
large chain of pizza places called Domino's Pizza.

312
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.770 
And the joke is, it's really good, throw the pizza away, put ketchup on the cardboard

313
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.010 
box.

314
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.919 
Anyway, they

315
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.998 
transform their entire

316
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.168 
enterprise to be as if they were

317
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.099 
born digital. Right.

318
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.739 
The only thing they didn't change the cardboard, was the recipe.

319
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.080 
Oh.

320
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.200 
So, yeah, well, they're losing less money because of

321
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.160 
that.

322
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.890 
And sadly, I think they did change their recipe,

323
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.850 
bet is that

324
00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:58.869 
they

325
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.870 
didn't ask.

326
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.590 
That was a question that they sort of forgot to ask

327
00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:09.599 
and every big product roll out that

328
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.919 
we joke about, like

329
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.539 
the new improved

330
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.540 
Coca-Cola.

331
00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:16.868 
They just didn't ask

332
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.890 
the right questions.

333
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160 
And at

334
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.180 
the time, and

335
00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:24.939 
sometimes you can't know until it's too late, till it's after the fact, but.

336
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.904 
But this is. If you're going to

337
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.069 
do an AB test, roll out an MVP of a product

338
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520 
then you need

339
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.849 
to make sure you're asking the right questions,

340
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.160 
ask them skillfully.

341
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.140 
Listen to the data.

342
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.150 
Oh, that can't be true.

343
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.339 
My customers, I know these people would love what I have.

344
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.619 
The last time I did this

345
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.070 
in real life,

346
00:17:57.079 --> 00:17:59.130 
my target customers loved it.

347
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.829 
They said they would crawl through

348
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.920 
through fire to get this.

349
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.380 
But they couldn't pay for it.

350
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.109 
The people who would pay

351
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.110 
for it were the

352
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.190 
ones who went,

353
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.229 
oh, God, not

354
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.249 
another one of these.

355
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.150 
Not like how much we can do that.

356
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.055 
The key to me of anything in any kind of entrepreneurship

357
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.959 
is being really scientific about it. Because we have evidence that

358
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.999 
it does work. There are some studies in Italy,

359
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.005 
wonderful experiments, Gambardella,

360
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.609 
and some others have been doing that, just bloody marvellous.

361
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.089 
I'm jealous that I didn't do that.

362
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.280 
I didn't get to do that one.

363
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.680 
But it's still the wisdom

364
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.569 
of the business model canvas, right?

365
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.989 
And it is so easy.

366
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.389 
To do impressive things with it that will kill

367
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.390 
the company.

368
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.599 
You have someone who is glib and persuasive and is

369
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200 
delusional.

370
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.730 
That is very easy.

371
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.980 
To get away from asking that tough question,

372
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.890 
yeah, does the emperor

373
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.163 
the emperor's new clothes right now.

374
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.839 
But I think that for me would be kind of the difference between the

375
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.550 
entrepreneur and someone

376
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:35.689 
who claims to

377
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.010 
be an entrepreneur. And I mean, this is also the status or

378
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.321 
the situation. We see many companies to be and no one dares

379
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.759 
to ask the right question.

380
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.829 
They are all afraid and they fear of receiving probably

381
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.459 
answers

382
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.809 
they don't want to hear. A warning to

383
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.446 
challenge the assumptions that are

384
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.072 
most cherished by you, the most ones you believe

385
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160 
to be true.

386
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.790 
And sometimes it's been true for 50 years.

387
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.230 
Now, there are some new research saying that the

388
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.489 
gravitational

389
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.490 
constant

390
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.709 
may not be a constant.

391
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.759 
In sort of extreme cases, and maybe that's why we can't find dark

392
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.020 
matter, because we got the maths wrong, right?

393
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.705 
Yeah, you do know the word phlogiston

394
00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.420 
now.

395
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.730 
There's a chat here right now.

396
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.329 
This is great. OK.

397
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640 
Back in the.

398
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.444 
I love this story because back in the day, people were thinking, OK, I'm going to burn

399
00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:52.269 
something. And I'm going to collect the gases and the ashes, and

400
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.179 
why does it weigh more after it burns?

401
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.360 
Right.

402
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.119 
So when you're burning something, it releases phlogiston, but the

403
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.950 
only way to work is

404
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.880 
phlogiston has negative weight. OK.

405
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.249 
And people go, but the math

406
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.960 
was perfect, maths, brilliant.

407
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.279 
Phligiston turned

408
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.579 
out to be

409
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.246 
oxygen that actually when you burn

410
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.390 
something it combines with oxygen, right.

411
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.000 
And some guy goes oh, we

412
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.789 
almost had it right, but we had it up and we had to turn everything

413
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.939 
upside down to get there.

414
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.509 
And I think about a lot of what we do in social

415
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.130 
science, there's a lot of phlogiston

416
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.949 
type things out there. Maybe we just

417
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.349 
in or not here in the marketplace, we just need to turn it upside

418
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.669 
down and go, what if we got

419
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.670 
it backwards?

420
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:47.439 
Right.

421
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.630 
And I

422
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.789 
am known for

423
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.739 
we're studying

424
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.920 
entrepreneurial intentions. And there are two critical

425
00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:01.960 
antecedence of intentions. But if you do the regression, if you

426
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.974 
if you use intentions as the predictors of the antecedence,

427
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.099 
our score goes up.

428
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040 
Wait.

429
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.550 
We got it backwards.

430
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.739 
Right.

431
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.910 
Well, but it turns out is if you realise, oh, it's a dynamic process

432
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.689 
so it doesn't matter where it starts, that

433
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.430 
intent, attitudes,

434
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:28.219 
attitude and that is how it goes.

435
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.089 
My hand went out of the screen here, sorry. That's why the

436
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.800 
score are always really good, because you're capturing, it's

437
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.950 
sort of biasing the explanatory power upward.

438
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.370 
Right.

439
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.269 
And the more I study neuroscience,

440
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.270 
more intent may

441
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.710 
actually be the initial state that we just instinctively or

442
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.162 
at a very immediate reaction like so.

443
00:22:59.370 --> 00:22:59.729 
So I

444
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.650 
have one final question for you.

445
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.160 
Today is your lucky day.

446
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.770 
I'm a fairy, and I grant you one wish.

447
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.829 
What wish would that be in the field of entrepreneurship?

448
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.789 
And I can't ask for more wishes now.

449
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.410 
So you're a smart genie, OK?

450
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.859 
My gut says, that we do a better job

451
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.232 
of engaging across all these

452
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.799 
groups. That a bunch of educators spend time

453
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.269 
talking to kindergarten teachers.

454
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.970 
Evenings at the pub.

455
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.572 
Education is going to get better, yeah, that and

456
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.030 
this is still threatening to a lot of people.

457
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.289 
I mean, there are still people whose Dean's will yell at them if they do experiential

458
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.989 
exercises, they do project-based learning

459
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.590 
in their classes.

460
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.739 
That will wetware your lectures

461
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740 
and quizzes.

462
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.929 
Then we have people who are studying natural ecosystems.

463
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:25.870 
And as much as I love them, I'm not sure national level data

464
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.250 
is as

465
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.549 
helpful as it could be.

466
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.700 
And certainly, entrepreneurs often dismiss it.

467
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.740 
The people of the entrepreneurial champions and sport organisations

468
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.059 
dismiss that

469
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.579 
because they know how localised this is,

470
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.390 
but the more that we

471
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.199 
talk to each other finding questions

472
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.119 
that I can

473
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.130 
move from, it's now

474
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.039 
time then to David

475
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040 
Hilbert.

476
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:56.099 
I can use 5 minutes of his day in 1900s World's smartest man, number one mathematician

477
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.550 
in the world. And he has amassed buddies while hanging out

478
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.729 
and going is the field of maths.

479
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.759 
Growing or just getting bigger and you get it

480
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.299 
and said, yeah, what what is it going to take to move boards.

481
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.435 
And Hilbert took all and came like twenty six problems.

482
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.539 
If we address

483
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.160 
these problems, we don't even have to answer them.

484
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.400 
But just addressing these problems,

485
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.963 
it moves forward. And there are some,

486
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.499 
like the Romanian conjecture

487
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.990 
that haven't been solved.

488
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.058 
But the research to trying has accelerated mathematics in just

489
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:37.629 
marvellous

490
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.869 
directions, and I think six of

491
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.299 
the problems were considered impossible to solve.

492
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.569 
When they somebody mathematicians read this can't be solved, et cetera,

493
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600 
Hold my beer,

494
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.740 
I'll be back in a minute. And they thought

495
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.990 
and they

496
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.022 
cracked the case again moving forward.

497
00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.670 
And I think

498
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.320 
what happens is when you got I've been trying to do is bringing together like

499
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.740 
the Kaufman

500
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.605 
issue ecosystem builder types, and the policy guys,

501
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.059 
and the scholars and talking about what are  their big burning

502
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.619 
questions and finding

503
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.060 
out some of them are the same.

504
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.330 
How do we have to improve the governance of ecosystems?

505
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.319 
But this was a great wish, right?

506
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.850 
So, I mean, we really need this diversity.

507
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.779 
We need to bring

508
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.549 
together those

509
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:38.019 
people. And I think for me personally, you are one of

510
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.410 
those people. I mean, you're bringing together people around the world.

511
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.780 
And for me, you're an inspiration.

512
00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.170 
Every time it's like I listen to what you're saying, I'm like, yes, we need

513
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.480 
like one thousand one million

514
00:26:53.069 --> 00:26:54.069 
Morris, because that

515
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.779 
that would be a very frightening

516
00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.780 
world.

517
00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.703 
Yeah, that's actually the US actually

518
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.869 
passed

519
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.979 
a bill forbidding the cloning of me.

520
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.279 
OK, well, of everybody.

521
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.840 
Every human. But I'm take it personally.

522
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.359 
All right.

523
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.859 
So have a great day. Thank you so much.

524
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.339 
Talk to you soon.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.200 
Hello everyone, welcome to video
clip five point three in which

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.600 
I want to explain you how to model
decisions and how to verify

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.450 
decision tables.

4
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.930 
It's more or less made in a
business context and therefore

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.240 
you usually come from
a process model

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.930 
including a decision task like
calculate discount for example

7
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.510 
and behind this task you can
link business decision worlds.

8
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.380 
So both models have its own purpose I would
say and they compliment each other.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.110 
So on the one hand and process
models are focused on

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.980 
business logic meaning who's
responsible, what needs to

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.970 
be done, under which conditions, and
the decision model is more focused on

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.730 
what needs to determine at first
and what rule needs to be applied

13
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.550 
and both in combination deliver
the full transparency

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.880 
of the business process and the decisions
make a making behind the process.

15
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.550 
As a short repetition and as I've
mentioned you come from business process

16
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.640 
including additional task for example
this task called decision model

17
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.740 
making or a decision which is made behind
and the result of the decision so

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.880 
we talk about the the top level
decision delivers the result

19
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.950 
back into the process and the
gateway controls what steps needs

20
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.850 
to be done at first.

21
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.170 
Where to mark a task as a
decision task or process you

22
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.350 
need to change the task type
to business rule task which

23
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.140 
allows you to link to
an existing diagram.

24
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
And we also need to take care of
that all possible decisions

25
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
or all possible output better
seen need to be covered in

26
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.660 
the process you cannot have an
output of a decision which is

27
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.100 
not covered in the
business process.

28
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.710 
That would imply that the business
process is not complete

29
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
and you always need to express
what happened with the result

30
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.470 
of a process.

31
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.590 
There are two ways to create new
decision diagrams in Signavio.

32
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.520 
The first way would be to or you
are already in the explorer view

33
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.500 
means you click on you and simply
create a new decision diagram.

34
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.960 
But you can also create a new diagram
coming from business process.

35
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.980 
When you click in the process in
the task on the upper left corner

36
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.150 
on the table icon the
system ask you ok

37
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.590 
do you want to link to an
existing process decision model

38
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.860 
or do you want to create a new
one. And the new process

39
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.960 
decision model gets the same name as
a task has in the business process.

40
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.880 
So the ideas were basically the
approaches and decision modelling

41
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.410 
you start with a
decision at first.

42
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.890 
It means you define the decision
drag and drop from the

43
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.270 
from the left icon element
panel to the canvas.

44
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.480 
Then we define the inputs what is
needed to make the decision.

45
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.850 
For example here we have
the driver category

46
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.470 
and to determine the category
we need the inputs

47
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.230 
of if the driver has already
attended a safe driving training

48
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.400 
and the age of the of
the driver itself.

49
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.290 
In this third step
you can make

50
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.150 
or you can think about
your structure

51
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.710 
how you want to structure your
decision diagram, especially

52
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.250 
on the requirements
level because

53
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.140 
you need to think about how
can the model be extended

54
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.990 
further requirements needs
to be added and therefore

55
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.630 
it could be come to a problem if you
have structures like this one.

56
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.690 
Then it's not easy to to add new
requirements to the decision

57
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.110 
because there's simply no space and
you need to create space first.

58
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.100 
But it's not not
very scalable.

59
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.640 
There's also another approach
and practice I've or I have

60
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.120 
seen in practice actually to
use a structure like this one

61
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.770 
which allows you more to to
be more flexible. You have

62
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.330 
the subdivision
for example

63
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.190 
and below the sub decision you
have different inputs but

64
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.510 
everything can be extended extended
further to the right side

65
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.360 
without running into
space problems.

66
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.440 
But then the model
is built up more

67
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.860 
from from top to bottom instead
from yeah instead from

68
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.590 
building it's modular wise
next to each other.

69
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.900 
You need to define the data types
in your decision tables so

70
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.210 
once the requirements have been defined
you can go into the logic level

71
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.540 
and in the table you need to set the
data type of the input at first.

72
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.660 
The second step would be or the
next step would be to define

73
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.170 
the logic then so the on the fifth step
includes creating the business rules and

74
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.640 
this can only be done after
you have defined the inputs.

75
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.100 
You have the data type for the
input also for the output

76
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.970 
and only this after this have been
defined you can start modelling

77
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.790 
your business rules.

78
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.010 
I'd like to show you what looks
like an Signavio process manager.

79
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.340 
So usually we come from
a process. This is our

80
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.540 
insurance process called car insurance
process we have used before.

81
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.870 
And here we have the decision
task check insurance criterias.

82
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.100 
To say that this is a decision task
where the business rule logic

83
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.200 
is executed behind we need to mark
that task as a decision task.

84
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.850 
Therefore we can open the
attribute on the right side

85
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.930 
and choose a task type.

86
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.730 
This mark highlights this
task as a decisionnal task

87
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.490 
and you can easily see that in the
upper left corner by the table icon.

88
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.240 
After clicking on the table icon
system ask me they want to

89
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.830 
create a new
decision diagram

90
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.370 
with the same name or if I want
to link to an existing one.

91
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.510 
And actually I want to link
to an existing one which is

92
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.590 
check insurance criterias this
decision model already exists.

93
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.910 
Now I can easily jump
to the existing

94
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.860 
model. This model
is now about

95
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.900 
figuring out if the yeah I
would say the customers is

96
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.620 
the customer eligible for
getting an insurance here

97
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.320 
and this is you can see here is
depends on a certain scoring

98
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.650 
and the scoring will be determined
by I would say the properties of

99
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.840 
the car which needs to be insured
and the properties of the driver.

100
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.890 
The car has a look at or
considers the airbag equipment,

101
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.800 
the car's value, also if the
car is listed in the the high

102
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.550 
theft probability list. If this
is the case of course then

103
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.750 
yeah then the I
would say the

104
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.310 
eligibility was as an influence
as eligibility itself.

105
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.340 
And if the driver

106
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.740 
or the driver will be
categorized after the criteria

107
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.200 
is for the age of course.
It's the age is

108
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.220 
an important factor in insurance
scenarios and also if the

109
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.040 
drivers already attended a
safe driving training.

110
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.000 
What I want to do now is with you
we want to extent this decision

111
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.800 
model by further criterias and
although further subdivisions

112
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.840 
and one of them is to

113
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.230 
for example we want to
bring in the criteria

114
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.140 
to evaluate the behavior of
the driver´. For example if

115
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.050 
the driver's was already
involved in certain accidents,

116
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.190 
also traffic violations

117
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.560 
and this needs to be considered
in our decision making process.

118
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.030 
Therefore I want
to create a

119
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.270 
new decision with you.

120
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.830 
Driving

121
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.180 
just got not driver category it's
not a driving record category.

122
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.920 
And we need the inputs.

123
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.100 
It's a driver has already been
conducted to a DUI which means

124
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:26.080 
in the past has a driver been conducted
because of alcoholism or drugs

125
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.610 
while driving a car. It is
important to know for the

126
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.490 
insurance company.

127
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.700 
Let's create a bit
more space here.

128
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.530 
If the driver was already involved
in traffic violations. And we need

129
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.080 
also to know which is
also quite important

130
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.350 
if the driver was in traffic accidents.
So violations and accidents

131
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.030 
difference

132
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.990 
or let's say in
accidents.

133
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.930 
And now we have to find the
requirements for the new decision. It

134
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.330 
means we can now enter the decision
logic level by clicking on the

135
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.940 
upper left icon on
decision table here

136
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.930 
which allows us to um
yeah to refine our

137
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.260 
requirements. So on the one
hand we could say conducted

138
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.910 
of DUI is not
a text value

139
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.060 
this a boolean let's say boolean
value because we have two

140
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.700 
ways either someone has been
conducted or not. So it means he

141
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.170 
has no condition or better saying
the true false condition.

142
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.610 
Traffic violations
is also

143
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.280 
we could even ask for

144
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.730 
the number of involved a
violations. So yes no is not

145
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.110 
not not precise enough.
We could even say

146
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.730 
in how many the person
was involved.

147
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.240 
You say we do the same for the accidents also
the number of accidents the person is involved

148
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.040 
and the outcome
is the driving

149
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.050 
record category.

150
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.300 
Since we talk about a category
the proper data type would

151
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.000 
be an enumeration because we
can have different categories

152
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.290 
and the enumeration allows us to
define a list of values where

153
00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.580 
we can choose from. It could even
work as text but text is always

154
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.520 
quite error prone,
would rather suggest

155
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.350 
a list where everyone can
choose the way you.

156
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.750 
So we could have
the high risk.

157
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.300 
And we have normal risk or the
category is just normal.

158
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.960 
Now it's much easier to

159
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.510 
let me make a full
screen here.

160
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.390 
It's much easier now to choose
from the existing values.

161
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.210 
And now we can start defining
our business rules. So

162
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.930 
if we if we want to define that if
someone has been already conducted by

163
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.590 
DUI we can say there is already
high risk. That's one

164
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.320 
of the business rules
existing in the company

165
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.020 
everyone who has
conducted a DUI will be

166
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.790 
categorized into
high risk.

167
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.620 
We could even say if someone
has not been conducted

168
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.750 
but was involved in I
would say more than

169
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.460 
four traffic violations

170
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.290 
can also be categorised
as a high risk.

171
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.860 
If someone has not been

172
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:22.610 
conducted and also not involved
in four traffic violations

173
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.480 
but involved in more
than four accidents

174
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.100 
it's also a high
risk and to

175
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.240 
to not to define all these again
I can also copy and paste

176
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.430 
the values. I mean we have already
found that here I can copy that

177
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.200 
paste it in that cell which
makes it even very easy to

178
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.030 
define the logic.

179
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.970 
Now we could we could
check what was missing.

180
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.220 
So on the upper left corner of the
most important button in decision

181
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.170 
modelling or decision
table verification which

182
00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.220 
is a verify
button here.

183
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.220 
The verify button
tells me

184
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.920 
there's no rule there's a missing
obviously it's not complete

185
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.080 
it's no rule for the case someone
is not conducted to a DUI,

186
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.510 
has less than four
traffic violations,

187
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.220 
and has less than four
or is not involved in

188
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.500 
less than four
accidents,

189
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.240 
which is true because it is the only
rule which is missing and our

190
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.980 
system tells me everything is
fine. There is no case which is

191
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.800 
not covered by any
business rule

192
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.880 
and that tells us decision
table is complete.

193
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.220 
And what we need to
consider now is

194
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.860 
that the outcome
of this decision

195
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.710 
high risk or normal needs to be
considered in the upper decision

196
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.610 
because you want to consider
that as a sub decision.

197
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.710 
So when we go to driver
eligibility we need to add

198
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:04.880 
the input from the sub decision. So
let's say we add an input column here

199
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.580 
which can be easily changed by
drag and drop so the order can

200
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.880 
be can be changed here and I would
say the input column refers to

201
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.560 
the outcome of the sub decision.
So here we want to consider

202
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.820 
now the record
category. And

203
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.210 
that allows us to define that
everybody who has a high risk

204
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.280 
or categorized with a high
risk is not insurable.

205
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.030 
It doesn't matter what
kind of driver he is.

206
00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.080 
It's simply not

207
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.900 
ok we can move it here. It is
simply not insurable. We do not

208
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.290 
do not want to insure
people with a high risk.

209
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.530 
And then we could say

210
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.020 
that everybody
who's normal

211
00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.740 
and has been classified as an
experienced driver I would even say

212
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.530 
and a novice driver

213
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.540 
the restricted insurable
and everybody whose

214
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.910 
categorised as normal with the
behavior and reached the driver

215
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.030 
category as typical driver is
he is definitely insurable.

216
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.230 
It's really check everything
is fine yep we have

217
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.850 
we didn't forget any
rule. But just to

218
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.410 
to give you to show you how the
decision verification works, if

219
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.520 
he would change that
also to normal

220
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.320 
the system will tell me

221
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.740 
that all these three rules will be
overlapping because all three

222
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.210 
was applied to normal
and here we said

223
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.130 
whenever someone has been defined
as normal it doesn't matter

224
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.580 
what the driver categories he
gets uninsurable but he will

225
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.670 
say whenever someone is
defined as normal and

226
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.670 
reached to certain has reached
a certain driver category

227
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.460 
gets restricted or even
uninsurable and it contradicts

228
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.430 
with the first one. So we
have overlapping rules.

229
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.080 
The system is also able to find
that so we on the one hand

230
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.490 
we can find missing rules, on the other
hand we can find overlapping rules.

231
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.900 
So missing uniqueness
missing completeness

232
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.520 
is automatically detected by the
decision table verification.

233
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.140 
Therefore we need
to change it back

234
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.420 
to high risk in order
to be complete.

235
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.320 
And it's important that
to understand that both

236
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.200 
I would say
eligibilities

237
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.180 
lead to a certain decision
which assign a certain score.

238
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.860 
So for example if someone is not
eligible gets a score of hundred,

239
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.750 
someone's provisionally eligible
gets score fifty and everyone

240
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.710 
who is eligible and insurable doesn't
get any points. So the logic here is

241
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.860 
the less points the less points
someone have the better.

242
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.080 
And for each
other criteria

243
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.330 
the customer gets
additional points.

244
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.650 
And in the upper decision we can
say the top-level decision

245
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.120 
we need to consider different
things. On the one hand

246
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:19.340 
we want to to check the score
someone has achieved. So every

247
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.660 
everybody who has less than a hundred points
is automatically eligible for insurance.

248
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.570 
Everybodywho has reached the score
between hundred and hundred fifty

249
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.890 
leads to the outcome that the
review is necessary and we

250
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.870 
we go back in the
process we know

251
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.230 
review is necessary
leads to the case that

252
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.880 
the manager needs to
review the case here.

253
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.310 
Or the outcome could be someone
is not eligible for insurance

254
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.560 
because they have reached more
than one hundred fifty points

255
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.410 
reaching more than a hundred
fifty points would mean

256
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.240 
someone is definitely not
eligible or not insurable

257
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.610 
and so on. So there are different
combinations to reach

258
00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.730 
one hundred fifty points
but in total it means

259
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.170 
someone is simply not
eligible for insurance.

260
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.940 
I would say there's also another
criteria we need to consider in

261
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.330 
the top level decision because what
happens if someone is under eighteen?

262
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.580 
Someone is also not eligible for insurance
if the person is under eighteen

263
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.580 
and the age is only considered in the
driver records and the driver category

264
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.090 
because here we ask for the age. But I
would say if someone is under eighteen

265
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.100 
and this is also
criteria.

266
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.290 
Therefore we can
simply say

267
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.620 
let's connect the top level
decision with the age.

268
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.880 
I would say let's do
it in that way.

269
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.730 
And now the age has an influence to
determine the driver category but also

270
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.940 
to determine directly if
someone is eligible.

271
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.880 
And that needs to be considered
here. We can add another input

272
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.360 
refer to the age
we've connected.

273
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.060 
Now we could say you have another
rule here someone is also

274
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.740 
or the criteria to reach
one of these state this

275
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.920 
attributes is as you need to
be older then eighteen.

276
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.560 
This can be copied

277
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.110 
and if someone is
not eighteen

278
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.440 
we have the same result here he's
not eligible for insurance.

279
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.410 
Everything has been has been defined
correctly there's no rule which

280
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.050 
or no case which is not
covered. That's it.

281
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.920 
Yeah that shows how easy it is
to model or extend decisions

282
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.820 
to build decision models. I mean
they can even be more complex

283
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.640 
but basically it important to show
how the flow of information

284
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.840 
is and then you can easily built
in in other subdivisions extend

285
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.630 
your decision model by
further requirements.

286
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.840 
But you just need to make sure that the
outcome of subdecisions is considered

287
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.970 
in the top level decision
or the decision above.

288
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.020 
Okay so in this lesson
you have learned

289
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.010 
how to link from business processes
to decision models, how

290
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.480 
to extend decision models or
basically build decisions and play

291
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.560 
the result back in the
process in order to

292
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.490 
make sure that the outcome of
the decision model is covered

293
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.690 
in the business process
by the gateways.

294
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.450 
That concludes lesson
five point three.

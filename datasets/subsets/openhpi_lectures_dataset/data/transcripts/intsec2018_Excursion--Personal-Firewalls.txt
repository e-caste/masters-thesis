1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.510 
In this excursion, we want to
discuss personal firewalls and

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.220 
how to set up such a
personal firewall.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.260 
For that reason to show details,
we concentrate on windows

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.680 
firewall. The windows
firewall has been

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.320 
the standard component since
windows XP and windows over 2003

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.010 
so for many years. If you
install windows system,

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.810 
you have a component of
the windows firewall.

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.490 
Microsoft developed this windows
firewall after the disaster

9
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.060 
of "Blaster" and ''Sasser''warm. We
discussed this attacks when we

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.370 
spoke about the history
of internet attacks.

11
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.530 
And after the huge disasters
which was created

12
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960 
by that warms. There was a
criticism and that you as a

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.610 
provider, you as an
inventor of such

14
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.570 
an operating system. Your windows
should be microsoft. You should

15
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.310 
take care of the set the windows
systems which are protected

16
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.480 
in a right away.

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.210 
The Windows Firewall
has a networks,

18
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.850 
profiles with different restrictions.
There is, on the one side, a private

19
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
network which is usable for
home or workplace networks,

20
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.330 
file and printer sharing and
network recognition. You're

21
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.120 
doing it. For example, like in
your home. And there is a guest,

22
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.650 
There's a status a profile of
a guest or public network

23
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.890 
with relatively strong restrictions
for incoming connections

24
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.820 
which are mostly not allowed. So
this is a question, by the way,

25
00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.240 
you asked if you connect to a
new network which of system

26
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.080 
profiles you want to apply.
The active rules which are

27
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.800 
installed in your
windows firewall.

28
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.350 
He can be viewed and also can be
changed and it could be even

29
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.390 
turned off. Here you see a
screenshort, which is also allows

30
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.780 
you to introduce new
own roots. When you

31
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.660 
introduce a new road, they
are possible to do this.

32
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.780 
Program based, port-based,
you can do this predefined

33
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.170 
or user-defined, so our
different possibilities

34
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.860 
for specifying as the
type of support. And

35
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.790 
we want to give
an example.

36
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.600 
For example establishing
how to establish a rule

37
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.780 
to block a particular program.
For this application,

38
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.810 
You should navigate to control
panel system and security

39
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.910 
to windows firewall. Then
call up advanced settings.

40
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.580 
Advanced settings then you come
here, here is advanced settings

41
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.650 
and you can you come here to this
page and then you can create

42
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.240 
a new rule. You have to
say filter, you have

43
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.620 
to define the filter in our
case where you want to do it

44
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.330 
Program based. You could also do
it port-based or predefined.

45
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.150 
I already mentioned this,
user-defined and we

46
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.700 
have a one to choose the
option program-based.

47
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.830 
Then you're from different
choices. You select this

48
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.540 
and come to this point.
Then you has to select

49
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.350 
a program which the
rule is connected to,

50
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.300 
and the rules should be connected
to. And this is selection along

51
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.550 
the installation path. For
example, we select the program

52
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.940 
the ownCloud, so ownCloud is
specified by giving here.

53
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.840 
See path of this installation
path of the program.

54
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.160 
And then you has to select the action
to be performed. For example,

55
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.730 
"Block the connection" to you
see here are different choices

56
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.310 
to perform and to
select an action.

57
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.650 
And we select the block connection.
Then we have to select the type

58
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.550 
of networks, to which still
rule is to be applied.

59
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.390 
So we can do it domain, we
can do it private, we

60
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.790 
can do it public. And finally
we have to name the rule.

61
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.380 
There's also the possibility to
describe, so for later remembering

62
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.080 
what it is here and the name of
the rule. Then you can give

63
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.470 
a description. Now as
a rule is active

64
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.940 
and rule prohibits
outgoing connections

65
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.000 
of the ownCloud application.
OwnCloud that while

66
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.710 
program and what we defined what
kind of action we defined

67
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.410 
was a rule, was to probe
it outgoing connections.

68
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.020 
So own cloud applications can
no longer connect to deserve.

69
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.690 
So you see, It also is quite
difficult to indefinite

70
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.080 
such firewall rules. Here with
this windows firewall, microsoft

71
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.920 
find a way to even how nonexperts
to define their roles.

72
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:06.060 
For example, to example we
discussed a secure connections

73
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.870 
to prohibit outgoing connections
or two programs, but when I

74
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.550 
could do similar things you
should in any case do it very

75
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.380 
carefully. But you see
it's a possibility to

76
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.950 
specific use to adapt
this windows firewall

77
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.930 
to specific use
on your system

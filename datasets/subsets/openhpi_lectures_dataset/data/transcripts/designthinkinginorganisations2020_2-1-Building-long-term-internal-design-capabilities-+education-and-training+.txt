00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.630 
Welcome to our OpenHPI course of
mastering design thinking in organizations.

2
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.570 
I'm Dannielly and the topic of today is how to
build long term internal design capabilities

3
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.100 
in organizations. The learning
objectives of today's module are

4
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.500 
1:To understand why we should build
long term internal design capabilities.

5
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.230 
2: to understand fundamental practices
that support the development

6
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.080 
of a long term internal design
capability. And 3: to be inspired

7
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.070 
by new ways of working.

8
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.040 
If we take a look at our design
thinking implementation wheel,

9
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.540 
we are in the topic of education
training and resources,

10
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.220 
to complement the practical
knowledge provided by Christian

11
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.580 
Styger from the Haver group. I
will talk a little bit about

12
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.490 
what are some of the fundamental
practices to develop a long

13
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.600 
term design thinking capability and
why we should know about them.

14
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.840 
First of all, why should we build
a design thinking capability

15
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.770 
within the management literature?
It has been discussed the

16
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.200 
importance of design thinking to
encourage innovation and economic

17
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.580 
growth in business
organizations.

18
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.750 
Design thinking is recognized as
an approach that brings the

19
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.980 
designers principles and
mindset to problem solving

20
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.320 
many companies throughout the world.
We are using design thinking

21
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.770 
to not only develop new products, but also to
reinvent the entire organizational strategy,

22
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.980 
and that happens because
of many reasons.

23
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.770 
Today, I want to
mention four reasons.

24
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.580 
The first reason is, the designer thinking needs
ability to find hidden needs.

25
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.280 
This ability together with design thinking
is ability to foster collaboration

26
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.050 
and inspired teams to become more creative
have been extensively discussed

27
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
not only by academics but
also by practitioners.

28
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.290 
These are normally the reasons why companies
start implementing design thinking

29
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.340 
in parallel. Many researchers
have started to look into the

30
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.540 
financial impact of design thinking.
However, since design thinking

31
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.720 
is a very young research topic, these
results are very preliminary.

32
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.610 
Some studies have suggested that
the scientific implementation

33
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.380 
might lead to reduced
development costs,

34
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.260 
that happens because different departments
are encouraged to work together

35
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.720 
at the early stages of
the development process,

36
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.310 
as a consequence they have less problems
with handover tasks and rework.

37
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.610 
For example, since teams from
different departments are involved

38
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.610 
in creating the concept of the product
early in the development process,

39
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.040 
they become more familiar with
the product very early in the

40
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.570 
process and they are also able to actively
express their opinions and introduce ideas.

41
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.930 
Also, it's important to say that there
is a whole debate around whether

42
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.680 
it makes sense to calculate the financial
impact of design thinking or not.

43
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.460 
For some researchers and petitioners
design thinking is an abstract concept

44
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.670 
and therefore it's not possible to
calculate its financial contribution.

45
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.970 
All the researchers and practitioners
believe that since designers

46
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.940 
think it can be
operationalized in practice,

47
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.880 
it's possible to calculate
its financial impact.

48
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.640 
What about you? What
do you think?

49
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.540 
One thing is for sure, if we want to
maximize design thinking and its benefits,

50
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.550 
it's important to have a long term
commitment to cultural and mindset change.

51
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.970 
Real change does not happen in one
day, it requires time for commitment

52
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.330 
and resilience to
learn from failures.

53
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.090 
Design thinking must be
strategically integrated.

54
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.680 
But how to start? Before we look
into that, I would like to mention

55
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.150 
our definition of what is
design a thinking capability.

56
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.880 
We define design-thinking
capability as a company's ability

57
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.910 
to deploy design practice to support its
innovation efforts on the strategic

58
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.890 
and functional levels.

59
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.630 
It's the ability to use design to
reconfigure and reinvent the organization,

60
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.500 
to stay competitive
in the market.

61
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.450 
Therefore it's fundamental to promote
awareness of design and implementation

62
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.650 
among relevant functions
in the company.

63
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.370 
Let's take a look
on how to do that.

64
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.660 
In a study conducted in 2019,
when many companies were interviewed

65
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.990 
to understand the critical factors
for a successful design and

66
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.800 
implementation, the design thinking coach of
a German manufacturer of power systems

67
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.920 
mentioned Management support
as being highly important.

68
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:16.310 
The interviewee mentioned that 3
years before the CEO of the company

69
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.440 
thought that the company
needed to change,

70
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.110 
that they needed to
get more innovative,

71
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.440 
so the CEO built up a completely new department
which was called Digital solutions,

72
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.080 
and one team of this department was
responsible for Design Thinking.

73
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.660 
He also mentioned that the design
implementation only really worked

74
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.110 
because they had management support to
implement it into their normal work life.

75
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.900 
Since design thinking challenges
not only organization of

76
00:06:52.910 --> 00:07:00.110 
work, but also power structures manages that
want to truly engage in designing thinking,

77
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.160 
need to formally
communicated their support.

78
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.110 
and encourage their employees to
engage in its implementation.

79
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.170 
Considering the investment of time
effort and resources needed

80
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.040 
to embed design-thinking
in large organizations,

81
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.280 
it is agreed that the implementation of design
techniques requires top management support.

82
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.790 
Ideally, leadership should be
grounded in serious interest, long

83
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.020 
term commitment and openness to change.
Organizations are experimenting

84
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.540 
with a variety of education and learning
approaches to design thinking,

85
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.820 
for example, the most common
route for organizations to get

86
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:54.390 
in touch with anything is workshops provided
by external cultures or consultants.

87
00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.060 
These workshops can range from
a fixed time, for example, 2

88
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.240 
days or 4 months, to actually
happen in a continuous format,

89
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:11.730 
where the company provides an environment
where the teams are enabled and encouraged

90
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.420 
to build new innovation
capabilities.

91
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.940 
This training is quite often targeted at
specific teams within the organization.

92
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.870 
However, more and more companies
are now developing institutional

93
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.850 
training programs where the entire
organization is now able to learn

94
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.620 
and apply innovation methodology
on a continuous basis,

95
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.400 
providing workshops has been seen
as a good way to get people

96
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:47.040 
with little or no experience with desired
thinking interested in the topic.

97
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.790 
For example, here at the HPI, we
have the D school that offers

98
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.340 
basic and advanced education
on design thinking,

99
00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.910 
and also the HPI academy that
offers professional education

100
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.390 
or many different aspects of
Design Thinking. For example, on

101
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.610 
how to perform a
proper synthesis.

102
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.330 
A success factor for any training,
whether provided by consultants

103
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.770 
and cultures institutions,
or internal programs,

104
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.250 
it seemed to lie in the adaptation
of training content to the

105
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.660 
specific working context and
needs of the practitioner.

106
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.770 
Therefore it is the content of
the educational material that

107
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.370 
needs to be aligned with the
company's strategies and culture.

108
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.370 
Although providing training is a
good starting point, only doing

109
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.060 
that it's not enough to ensure
that teams are ready to apply

110
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:51.690 
the new learnings correctly for any
training or educational offer.

111
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.720 
To have a lasting impact, it is
important to realise that gaining

112
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.570 
competencies in designing thinking
is not a matter of attaining one

113
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:09.520 
or two workshops, but a learning process
that takes time effort and motivation.

114
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.390 
To provide the necessary resources
to enable this learning journey

115
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.690 
is seen to be a key
success factor.

116
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:26.880 
For example, resources like spaces,
material, financial resources, and time

117
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.170 
are considered to be critical when encouraging
teams to develop new capabilities.

118
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.390 
These spaces can be digital
and non-digital,

119
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:43.950 
before the spaces were only considered in
terms of the physical characteristics.

120
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.120 
For example, furniture and
whiteboards. However, there are more

121
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.800 
and more collaborative tools that
teams can use online to co-create,

122
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:01.810 
document decisions, and also link
different phases of the project.

123
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.960 
The same applies to materials.
Digital and non-digital material

124
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:13.890 
have become more and more explored
depending on the nature of the problem.

125
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:19.460 
It is important to provide teams with
necessary material for prototyping,

126
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.490 
and also conducting need-finding in a
digital and non digital environment.

127
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:32.310 
In order to do all that, it's
essential to provide a budget

128
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.020 
for the teams to perform actions
that are important for innovation.

129
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.360 
It does not mean that it's necessary to
have a huge funding available for that.

130
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:50.500 
as I will be mentioned later in
this module, start small and scale.

131
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.580 
Finally, we have to be patient, people
need time to digest information,

132
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.800 
practice the new skills, fail
and then learn from it.

133
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.520 
We should not expect to have
inexperienced teams being high

134
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.120 
performers in innovation
methodologies, after they have been

135
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:19.250 
exposed to some training
mindset. Change requires time.

136
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:26.490 
Besides security management support and
providing training and necessary resources,

137
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.560 
it is fundamental to make visible the
value and benefit of design thinking.

138
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:39.030 
Creation of awareness is necessary for
implementing design-thinking successfully.

139
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:45.930 
These people will not believe in a methodology
until they have proven and experienced

140
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.440 
to grow design-thinking in the
organization. It's also necessary

141
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.960 
to create a sense of
purpose and meaning.

142
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.960 
If employees do not see the
purpose of what they are doing,

143
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.390 
they will most
likely not do it,

144
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.460 
or they will do it
with low performance.

145
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.840 
Therefore, an inspirational and
visionary leadership style should

146
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.410 
focus or create awareness of the value and
purpose of implementing design thinking.

147
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:24.050 
This means that, in order to enable
continuous learning of individuals,

148
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:30.770 
leadership should put a strong focus
on empowerment and self leadership.

149
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.250 
For example, by providing a safe
space where people could really

150
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:43.350 
live up and open up. Leaders are expected
to create environments of trust

151
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.210 
and psychological safety
and to let go of control.

152
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.670 
Such a safe space can further help
foster an internal community

153
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:59.820 
of allies, ambassadors. Some companies
rely on small exercises and questions

154
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.610 
that re-fuels the mindset
into everyday work.

155
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:09.900 
Finally, after you have empowered
one team or an individual

156
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.470 
to work with innovation
methodologies, it might be the time

157
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.010 
to start scaling it to other
individuals or teams.

158
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:26.080 
To do that, many companies start by picking
a small challenge of short duration,

159
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.620 
with high likelihood
of success.

160
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:35.460 
Creating small experiments that allow
the team to practice gathering data,

161
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.180 
testing frequently, and
iterating quickly.

162
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:45.840 
Perhaps you could suggest a time each
week for teams to work on these skills.

163
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.400 
Always start with a small part of
your business and grow over time.

164
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.850 
The idea is to expose the selected
group of people to the methodology

165
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.580 
in a way that they can easily
understand and practice.

166
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.700 
This way positive results
could be shown quickly.

167
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:11.570 
Moreover, companies also tend to
identify early adopters to

168
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.400 
act as supporters of developing
design thinking practices. In

169
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.020 
order to do that, it's necessary
to build trust and confidence,

170
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:27.880 
and enabling a purpose driven leadership
style should have a strong communication

171
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.470 
and enabled team should
learn how to work together.

172
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:37.570 
By building on trust and enabling employees
to unleash the creative confidence,

173
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:43.450 
companies can foster collaboration.
For example, in some cases,

174
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:50.170 
their employees worked together for years
but never collaborated intensively.

175
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.970 
By doing that, it makes it possible to leverage
the diverse expertise and knowledge

176
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:04.020 
of different people to improvise enhance
discover new problems and solutions.

177
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:09.910 
Finally, another approach is to
form departments and roles that

178
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.910 
are responsible for design thinking,
or hiring people who already

179
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.170 
have this collaborative
mindset.

180
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.710 
In addition, ambassadors as
mentioned earlier can internally

181
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:29.220 
spread the word of design thinking.
These people have the formal

182
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.930 
duty of developing designing
thinking and supporting its growth

183
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:40.030 
and maintaining in the organization.
Finally, it is fundamental to test

184
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.120 
and iterate the design thinking
implementation strategy,

185
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:50.820 
by learning from past projects and also
customizing the practices based on that.

186
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.120 
As mentioned before, inexperienced teams
need time to experiment and learn,

187
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:03.610 
that means that they will most
likely fail a couple of times,

188
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.540 
therefore an open
culture is fundamental.

189
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.630 
To sum up, in order to build a long
term design capability, companies

190
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.540 
need to reinvent themselves and
invest in cultural change.

191
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.560 
To do that, it's fundamental to
secure management support,

192
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.210 
provide training and the necessary
resources, create awareness

193
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:35.530 
of the value and benefit of design
thinking through a sense of purpose,

194
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:42.010 
and finally start small then
scale and iterate.

195
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.580 
If you want to learn more about how to
set up spaces and team composition

196
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:52.750 
in a way that will help in your journey to
develop a design aesthetic capability,

197
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.690 
you can watch our module on how
to create innovative spaces

198
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.930 
and the dream team.

199
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.750 
Thank you for your attention and see
you again as part of our next module.

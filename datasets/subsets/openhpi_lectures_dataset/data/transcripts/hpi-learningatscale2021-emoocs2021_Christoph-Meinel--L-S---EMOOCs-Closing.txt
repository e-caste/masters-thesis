00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.900 
Dear friends, dear colleagues, dear participants of the EMOOCS conference

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.321 
and of the Learning at Scale Conference 2021 (L@S21),

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.360 
we had together 3 very interesting days discussing

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.999 
the potential of digital education formats and of

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.590 
massive open online courses.

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.779 
Many thanks for your contributions and for your participation.

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.965 
Here is a short statistics: with the EMOOCS conference,

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.139 
we had 30 sessions with 3 keynote speakers, 66

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.806 
panelists, and 67 paper authors.

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.879 
And at the Learning at Scale conference, we had 12 sessions,

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.412 
3 keynote speakers, 25 panelists, and 37 papers.

12
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.599 
So, it was a really profound meeting between

13
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.099 
all the people that are involved in thinking how we

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.951 
can further develop our digital formats

15
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.569 
for education and for training.

16
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.150 
We had altogether 330 participants from 36 countries,

17
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.836 
62 from Germany, 59 from the US, 18 from Italy,

18
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.687 
9 from the UK, 8 from Spain, and then from many other

19
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.242 
countries too. Here is an age distribution which

20
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.235 
shows that although the main group is between 20 and 39

21
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.957 
years, we had participants of all

22
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.729 
age groups because it is a topic that is really relevant

23
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.920 
for our world.

24
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.160 
We live in times of digital transformation and digital education plays

25
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.569 
a key role and of course, there was a boost through the covid-19

26
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.900 
pandemic. It was explained to us in the keynote of Georgi

27
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.450 
Dimitrov, who stated that

28
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.340 
digital education is an essential part of the digital transformation

29
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.033 
of the whole society, and it is also a societal

30
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.419 
challenge. Covid-19 pandemic first experiences of distance

31
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.039 
and online learning brought such experiences for many

32
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.000 
learners and for many educators.

33
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.968 
So, in the European space, there

34
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.273 
is an estimation of 60% of learners using online learning.

35
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.369 
Covid-19 has to be a turning point in the use

36
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.590 
of education technology.

37
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.029 
At least this is considered in that way by 90% of

38
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.559 
the people that we asked for it.

39
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.567 
The 5 top challenges we found

40
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.360 
out are socioeconomic inequalities, insufficient infrastructures

41
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.957 
and internet, the lack of teacher training and guidance, the lack of plan

42
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.994 
and vision for the integration of digital technologies in education, and the

43
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.800 
lack of high-qualityonline learning content.

44
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.606 
Those are really big challenges that we

45
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.909 
have to think about and we have to contribute to solving

46
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.919 
this. Very interesting was the view

47
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.870 
in concerning also with the Covid-19 crisis, the

48
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.206 
keynote of Gaya Gamhewage from the World Health Organization.

49
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.550 
She made the point that they(WHO) need such

50
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.539 
education and tools like the MOOCs where many

51
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.919 
learners can be addressed in a very short time to help them

52
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.569 
to protect their health, to give them the information, to protect

53
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.570 
their life

54
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.659 
,and to deal with the pandemic situation, ensuring good health. Everyone needs to learn

55
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.039 
this and this is not with one learning

56
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.989 
event, it is across all the lifetime.

57
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.759 
The learning needs to be done because with new challenges come new

58
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.559 
insights. So, the health professionals, volunteers, and individuals

59
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.149 
need access to learning

60
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.499 
material, training material for protecting

61
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.070 
and preventing such crises.

62
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.019 
And the barriers to accessing such materials,

63
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.295 
such learning events, and learning offers

64
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.609 
must be proactively dismantled.

65
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.439 
Here are the impressive figures she showed that in

66
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.270 
the 4 years of the openWHO platform's

67
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.577 
online operations recording breakthroughs

68
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.429 
in the years 2017 to 2021, and we see how this number

69
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.532 
increases from some thousands of

70
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.892 
people that access this learning offered by the World Health Organization

71
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.269 
from the start of the year 2017 and increases over the pandemic situation

72
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.455 
to 540,000

73
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.644 
enrollments and the enrollments are from people all

74
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.296 
over the world. I remember that there were 94 languages they

75
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.065 
provide that the material in.

76
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.185 
Another topic we discussed in the context and

77
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.990 
the experience of Coursera is that low-skilledjobs

78
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.080 
are at risk from automation, that people need to be educated

79
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.200 
and need to be educated to a large extent.

80
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.240 
So, that we need

81
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.295 
learning formats, digital learning formats, like MOOCs.

82
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.389 
So, Jeff spoke about this and he showed in the numbers

83
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.149 
that many new digital job opportunities.

84
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.800 
This is a forecast for 2025,

85
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.559 
149 million such job opportunities and in

86
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.509 
the year 2020, they had 29 million new learners,

87
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.050 
77 million new enrollments.

88
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.980 
This shows that people understand and people like

89
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.035 
this format that we are thinking and discussing in our community.

90
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.220 
And we try to push this forward by our research, work

91
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.069 
by our provider, work by our political

92
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.825 
activities. Also, some other figures are interesting,

93
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.220 
more women are learning online, there was an increase

94
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.257 
of 39% in 2018 45% in 2020.

95
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.269 
So, this is really some important news.

96
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.899 
And there are so many papers, interesting papers, and discussions in the panel

97
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.320 
situation. So it's not possible to

98
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.620 
mention it all. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic situation.

99
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.939 
We could not meet in person, we could not meet in Potsdam.

100
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.540 
So, you missed something and not to be here.

101
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.639 
We tried to give a virtual Potsdam city tour, here is the link.

102
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.410 
So, we invite you to use this link and to follow

103
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.023 
Potsdam, immediately neighbors to Berlin and it

104
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.889 
was in the past a King's city.

105
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.487 
So, the king had his castle, of course, it's the capital in Berlin,

106
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.037 
but each weekend he came to Potsdam to Sansouci, a nice castle,

107
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.520 
a couple of buildings, and then he composed

108
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.180 
music. He had discussions with Voltaire and others.

109
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.339 
So it's really interesting.

110
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.031 
We have a nice landscape with

111
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.570 
lakes and rivers. Eventually, when we have the chance

112
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.559 
some years later to host EMOOCs and Learning at

113
00:08:41.698 --> 00:08:45.350 
Scale we'll come back to us, so, that you can see it all in person.

114
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.521 
So, in summary, we look back on great keynotes, excellent panels,

115
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.029 
many thanks to all the people, to all the colleagues that contributed.

116
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.829 
We had insights into the latest research work

117
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.479 
in the paper session. We had 2 interactive poster sessions to

118
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.850 
share new ideas and network sessions also helped during

119
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.242 
the coffee break to discuss something besides our

120
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.029 
topic, to come into talks with each other.

121
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.620 
Thank you to everyone who made this conference a success,

122
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.539 
who contributed. So we hope that

123
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.941 
we continue the cooperation with you all and wish

124
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.299 
you all personally and professionally the best.

125
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.230 
Thank you for taking part in these two conferences.

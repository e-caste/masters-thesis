00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.390 
In our OpenHPI course, Half

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.527 
Century of Internet, we

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.709 
now consider Wi-Fi,

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.130 
wireless networks

5
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.270 
as another example

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.829 
of a local area network.

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.410 
These wireless

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.689 
networks we see in

9
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.609 
the LAN area, but also in the

10
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.539 
metropolitan area in

11
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.090 
the wide-area network.

12
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.579 
And it is so

13
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.310 
popular because the connection

14
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.219 
with such type of mobile devices,

15
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.150 
such as Wi-Fi, such wireless

16
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.695 
networks, provides a possibility

17
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.479 
to connect wherever I

18
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.380 
am to connect me

19
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.420 
with the Internet.

20
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.350 
So the WiFi is a lowconnection

21
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.189 
with more freedom

22
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.032 
of movement and mobility.

23
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.249 
So this technology becomes

24
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.540 
more and more popular.

25
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.880 
And we see it

26
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.049 
in all places.

27
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.090 
We see it airports,

28
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.119 
in the offices,

29
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.829 
at home.

30
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.830 
So it's very

31
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.239 
important way to access

32
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.189 
the Internet, but it's

33
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.780 
not so fresh.

34
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.180 
So wireless networks

35
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420 
already here is the grandmother of internet.

36
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.129 
the ALOHAnet, 1971,

37
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.200 
this was a radio network

38
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.659 
that connects the

39
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.962 
Hawaiian main islands with a

40
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.439 
central computer.

41
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.659 
It had a very limited

42
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.424 
bandwidth, but it was its principles

43
00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:39.505 
that the radio

44
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.870 
signals are used for

45
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.699 
exchanging information between

46
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700 
computers. So Wi-Fi

47
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.959 
uses a star

48
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.090 
topology with

49
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.469 
a base station.

50
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.329 
We discussed when we

51
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.337 
looked to  local area networks,

52
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.889 
different types of

53
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.460 
topologies, a

54
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.860 
star topology here

55
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.860 
for Wi-Fi.

56
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.115 
It works in a way say, we

57
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.489 
need an access point

58
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.949 
and the access point

59
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.019 
ensures that data packages

60
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.330 
which are received

61
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.260 
around the access points

62
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.070 
could be forwarded

63
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.830 
to all the other connected computers

64
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.530 
and could be forwarded

65
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.029 
to the Internet.

66
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500 
Of course,

67
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.120 
here r standards are needed so that

68
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.009 
all the different devices

69
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.810 
could exactly interpret such

70
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
sequences of radio signals in

71
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.970 
the same way.

72
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.419 
Here is the number of such

73
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.420 
standards.

74
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.909 
It begins

75
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.439 
IEEE 802.11, a standard

76
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.970 
which specifies

77
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.450 
Wi-Fi.

78
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.810 
For example, we have

79
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.630 
different

80
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400 
.11 standards. 802.11a, this is

81
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.197 
54 Megabits/second in the 5

82
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.069 
Gigahertz frequency band.

83
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.460 
So standard 802.11b

84
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.740 
describes 11 Megabits per second

85
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.872 
in a 2.4

86
00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:17.226 
Gigahertz frequency band.

87
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.140 
802.11.i

88
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.950 
is

89
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.642 
concentrated on the security

90
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.070 
mechanism WPA and

91
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.010 
WP A2.

92
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.060 
The

93
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280 
wave 802.11ac concerns with WiFi

94
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.262 
with significantly increased

95
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.550 
performance.802.11ax

96
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.650 
Is the latest on that.

97
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.860 
It is the successor of 802.11ac.

98
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.280 
This is only a few of the

99
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.530 
most important stuff that

100
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.270 
we see in that area.

101
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.669 
Interesting to note, I already

102
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.220 
mentioned that there are different

103
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.539 
frequencies

104
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.659 
where Wi-Fi and networks

105
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.119 
which are used by Wi-Fi networks.

106
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.639 
So the modern routers

107
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.979 
also called dual-band routers

108
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.160 
and can operate in 2 different

109
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.009 
frequency bands,

110
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.050 
i.e. a 2.4 GHz

111
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.392 
frequency band and the 5

112
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.079 
GHz frequency band.

113
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.407 
Each frequency band has

114
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.308 
its advantages and its

115
00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:31.709 
disadvantages, we

116
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.160 
have no time to go into details.

117
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.499 
The older devices often

118
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.990 
are only using

119
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.173 
a 2.4 GHz

120
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.190 
bandwdith.

121
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.429 
In general the range

122
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.884 
of 2.4GHz

123
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.119 
is higher than that of

124
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.130 
the 5 GHz devices.

125
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.709 
Devices close to the router

126
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.019 
are more likely to use

127
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.519 
5 Gigahertz, and the devices

128
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.780 
further away

129
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.319 
connects with different physical

130
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.600 
properties of different

131
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.050 
frequencies.

132
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.680 
So a 5 Gigahertz offers

133
00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.720 
more channels without overlap

134
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.970 
and is generally

135
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.759 
used less frequently.

136
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.309 
And in the event

137
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.379 
of an indifference

138
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.449 
or slow data transmission,

139
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.149 
changing the channel frequency

140
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.232 
band can help in

141
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.350 
modern devices.

142
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.064 
Here is an example of the frequencies are utilised. So

143
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.501 
if we look at the 5 Gigahertz

144
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.069 
frequency band, then we

145
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.870 
have this range,

146
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.703 
so, for example, is a green

147
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.558 
one. So it's a typical

148
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.380 
range of your

149
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560 
FRITZ box.

150
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.730 
So

151
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.447 
there are the channels maximally occupied by the FRITZ box. We have

152
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.819 
also the other radio signals

153
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.109 
here.

154
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.329 
And so is the current

155
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.390 
assignment of WiFi channels

156
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.230 
with Wi-Fi networks

157
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.620 
in the vicinity of

158
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.540 
a FRITZ box here as

159
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.740 
an example, this is typically

160
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.779 
a situation used

161
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.080 
at home.

162
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.350 
Now and let's look towards more

163
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.310 
recent Wi-Fi technologies.

164
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.770 
So Wi-Fi 6.

165
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.850 
This is a new Wi-Fi standard.

166
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.020 
It is described

167
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.010 
as IEEE 802.11ax.

168
00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.519 
Wi-Fi 6 is a

169
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.599 
further development and improvement

170
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.600 
of the standard described in 802.11ac.

171
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.580 
So the ax router

172
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.350 
are able to handle more end

173
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.360 
devices

174
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.569 
than ac routers, in reaction

175
00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.690 
to the

176
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.799 
increase in the number

177
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.240 
of mobile devices

178
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.310 
that are in place today.

179
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.729 
Ideally, it is suited

180
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.709 
for environments, for

181
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.860 
example, offices

182
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.269 
with many Wi-Fi

183
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.270 
devices.

184
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.079 
This was not a case

185
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.590 
for older IEEE

186
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.579 
Wi-Fi standards.

187
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.829 
So the launch was

188
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.950 
in 2018.

189
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.359 
There was a first supporting

190
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.370 
access points brought

191
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.410 
to the market and

192
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.488 
the distribution of the entity

193
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.119 
rises. So as a mobile devices

194
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.459 
that can make use of this

195
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.990 
Wi-Fi technology

196
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.750 
started with the Samsung Galaxy

197
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.391 
S10 in the area of smartphones

198
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.657 
and the Asus Zenbook

199
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.410 
and Dell XPS 15

200
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.326 
and others in the device

201
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.154 
category of laptops.

202
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.389 
What are Wi-Fi devices?

203
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.480 
The connection of Wi-Fi

204
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.020 
to a star-shaped

205
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.220 
internet network and the internet

206
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.190 
is realized via dedicated

207
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.239 
internet systems.

208
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.519 
So the access points should not

209
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.360 
only take care of the

210
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.360 
devices around them,

211
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.491 
can interact with each other, the

212
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.901 
access points also helps each

213
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.739 
of the devices in its reach

214
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.139 
to connect to the

215
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.900 
internet, to connect to other

216
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.940 
networks.

217
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.210 
So we have switches,

218
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.860 
router and access points

219
00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.669 
which are needed.

220
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.639 
So here we have

221
00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:43.569 
the switch.

222
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.059 
Here we have the access point.

223
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.989 
Our wireless LAN

224
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.219 
was a switch.

225
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.870 
We connect to an

226
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.860 
Ethernet network.

227
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.408 
And from an Ethernet network, a

228
00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:54.467 
router is

229
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.740 
needed to

230
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.529 
transmit the data

231
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.600 
also to the Internet.

232
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.239 
In modern time

233
00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:06.639 
this is typical,

234
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.920 
the dedicated devices

235
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280 
are combined

236
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.150 
all in one device

237
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.099 
in such an access point.

238
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.370 
So that wireless LAN

239
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.140 
can be connected with the

240
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.369 
Ethernet and also

241
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.320 
connected to other

242
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.169 
networks in the Internet.

243
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.929 
How it is organized

244
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.909 
in a Wi-Fi, what we

245
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.709 
already discussed in the case

246
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800 
of an Ethernet how

247
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.890 
we control multiple

248
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520 
access.

249
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.620 
Because if there are different

250
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.789 
data coming at the same

251
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.162 
time, then they will destroy

252
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.579 
each other.

253
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.524 
And then it's no more guaranteed

254
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.780 
that data can be

255
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.417 
encoded and information

256
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.660 
can be found out.

257
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.799 
So in the case of Wi-Fi,

258
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.289 
it is very similarly organized

259
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.889 
to access control in case

260
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:06.890 
of Ethernet.

261
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.639 
But here, in case of a wireless

262
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.799 
communication, we have some

263
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.100 
special types of

264
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.389 
problems which are different

265
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.390 
from

266
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.499 
a domain

267
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.130 
situation. So

268
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.859 
here collisions can occur.

269
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.720 
For example, when

270
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.029 
one station cannot

271
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.070 
see another station

272
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.389 
set far away.

273
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.130 
Let's have a closer look.

274
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.200 
A and C

275
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.450 
can connect to device

276
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.639 
B because in both

277
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.440 
ranges A B

278
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.730 
is connected too,

279
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.549 
but A

280
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.619 
and C cannot

281
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.220 
directly

282
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.230 
see each other.

283
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.200 
So for device B

284
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.809 
the simultaneously incoming

285
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.029 
signals from A and C

286
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.570 
collide because

287
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.099 
when they start

288
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.350 
at C it looks that

289
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.589 
the that there are no

290
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.549 
signals transmitted

291
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.449 
and then they start both A and C

292
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.262 
to send and then there

293
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840 
we have a collision.

294
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.619 
So also here, in case we need

295
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.450 
a CSMA/CA

296
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.999 
(Carrier sense multiple avoidance/ Collision avoidance)

297
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.960 
in use to avoid such

298
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:33.830 
a collision it detects.

299
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.474 
So we need some modification

300
00:11:35.475 --> 00:11:36.475 
according

301
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.580 
to a the inetrnet.

302
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.449 
So a carrier

303
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.120 
sense multiple access and

304
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.129 
collision avoidance work

305
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.139 
as follows: A

306
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.330 
sends a request

307
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.840 
to B

308
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.519 
an RTS (request to send)

309
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.869 
signal to B,

310
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.710 
and B sends

311
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.510 
information to A, a

312
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.300 
clear to send (CTS)

313
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.859 
to A and then A

314
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.390 
starts to

315
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.400 
send the data package to B, and

316
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.090 
B

317
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.100 
sends an acknowledgement to A, I

318
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.240 
received your data.

319
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.789 
So in this case, such an

320
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.322 
acknowledgement we didn't have in

321
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.579 
the case of an Ethernet.

322
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.580 
Here

323
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.179 
it is much more difficult to

324
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.949 
organize the usage

325
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.929 
because in the

326
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.970 
air around

327
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.030 
the mobile system and wireless

328
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.409 
LAN.

329
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.269 
there are many signals and many

330
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.159 
partners can do things and

331
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.160 
so on.

332
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.210 
So all devices

333
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.340 
here,

334
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.210 
so the RTS and CTS signal are

335
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.230 
waiting with their own

336
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.460 
transmission.

337
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.090 
So collisions can

338
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.279 
only occur from

339
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280 
such places where RTS

340
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400 
and CTS signal

341
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.160 
cannot be here.

342
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.119 
And in that case we need

343
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.120 
this collision

344
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.809 
avoidance mechanism.

345
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.720 
So in case a collision is happening,

346
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.990 
both senders wait a random time

347
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.500 
random time before they

348
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.777 
start to newly send out

349
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.170 
such an RTS signal.

350
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.610 
So there's another problem

351
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.378 
here in the Wi-Fi

352
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.559 
network area that the

353
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.979 
exposed station problem,

354
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.510 
with causes additional

355
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.110 
complications here.

356
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.290 
Now we have ABC and

357
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.440 
an additional D

358
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.809 
and D cannot

359
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.080 
communicate

360
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.740 
with device C.

361
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.170 
Also, D is

362
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.419 
outside the transmission,

363
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.065 
repetition range of A and

364
00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.230 
B and

365
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.359 
no collision occur.

366
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.330 
So even if C are communicating,

367
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.669 
C suppose can communicate

368
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.669 
without creating a condition.

369
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.730 
So but C, it

370
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.329 
gets the problem.

371
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.330 
C here gets CTS

372
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.739 
signal from B

373
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.979 
to A, and therefore

374
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.070 
does not answer D

375
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.013 
because C does not knowthat

376
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.239 
D is not hearing the signal.

377
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.288 
So the  a multiple a

378
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.240 
accces with a collision avoidance

379
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.250 
for wireless(MACAW)

380
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.129 
can be used here in that

381
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.130 
situation.

382
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.610 
Device D sends

383
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.250 
a request to send

384
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.719 
to C, and this

385
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.730 
time C response

386
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.039 
after a short pause with a request

387
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.259 
of with a Request

388
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.260 
for Request to send(RRTS) signal

389
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520 
because C now

390
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.840 
realizes the transmission

391
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.618 
from A and the transmission from

392
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.559 
D were not

393
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.092 
a connected to each other.

394
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.770 
So afterwards previously

395
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.630 
introduced protocol CSMA/CA

396
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.280 
will be applied.

397
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.470 
So also in this situation

398
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.389 
there is the possibility

399
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.149 
to regulate

400
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.399 
in an efficient way.

401
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.070 
the communication in

402
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.950 
such a wireless network.

403
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.706 
What about security

404
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.369 
in wireless networks?

405
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.629 
Of course, this is in particular

406
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.190 
important to think about security

407
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.399 
in wireless networks because in

408
00:15:48.504 --> 00:15:50.400 
wireless networks, everyone

409
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.820 
within the range of the

410
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.829 
access points has

411
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.270 
a chance to

412
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.990 
read and see all the

413
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.657 
information said that are

414
00:16:00.684 --> 00:16:02.570 
sent in that wireless network.

415
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.339 
So with respect to the

416
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.679 
characteristics of the respective

417
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.297 
transmission media., the security

418
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.579 
level of wireless networks

419
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.029 
is much lower than in

420
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.059 
wired network because in the wired

421
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.010 
networks the hacker needs

422
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.139 
access to the

423
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.149 
carrier, needs access

424
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.150 
to the cable.

425
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.809 
So there is no physical access

426
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.234 
required for eavesdropping

427
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.755 
and also unauthorized use.

428
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.550 
So it's also

429
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.179 
not difficult to detect

430
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.570 
the Wi-Fi.

431
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.009 
There is a so-called

432
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.429 
parking lot attack.

433
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.239 
So you can see with your device

434
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.600 
which networks

435
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.640 
are active around you.

436
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.277 
And then you can try to

437
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.070 
eavesdrop

438
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.730 
or have unauthorised access to this network.

439
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.730 
So it's a passive attacks

440
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.599 
against such a Wi-Fi

441
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.100 
is to decrypt the captured

442
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.690 
traffic through statistical

443
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.069 
analyses and the active attack

444
00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.689 
is to take part

445
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.669 
and become a member

446
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.130 
in this network communication

447
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.715 
and directly attack other

448
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.380 
users of thsi network.

449
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.970 
What are the security measures

450
00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.098 
used here for

451
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.419 
wireless networks?

452
00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.079 
To protect such Wi-Fis

453
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.273 
the encryption protocol (WEP)

454
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.960 
the wired equivalent privacy,

455
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.839 
was originally defined

456
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.140 
when the IEEE 801.11b

457
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.010 
standard was published.

458
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.080 
So this was the first

459
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.699 
network technology

460
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.959 
standard with such an

461
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.180 
encryption protocol.

462
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.230 
However.

463
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.259 
This WEP protocol

464
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.380 
is very old, and it's based

465
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.329 
on, meanwhile insecure

466
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.430 
encryption algorithms like

467
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.680 
RC4 can be corrected

468
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.119 
very easily today.

469
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.920 
So it's not enough

470
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.982 
to be used

471
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.539 
today as a protection of

472
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.700 
an Wi-Fi today.

473
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.364 
One should work with WPA2,

474
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.569 
with encryption method

475
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.640 
(AES) advanced encryption

476
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.360 
security.

477
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.799 
And this is

478
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.569 
continued to be developed.

479
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.119 
So in future it

480
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120 
will be replaced by

481
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.950 
a WPA3.

482
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.445 
So you should definitely,

483
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.769 
if you use a

484
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.770 
wireless network,

485
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.990 
use WPA3 protection.

486
00:18:44.372 --> 00:18:45.372 
The WPA3

487
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.989 
excludes all the insecure

488
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.359 
protocols and has improved

489
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.754 
authentication and cryptography.

490
00:18:55.755 --> 00:18:56.755 
Cryptography

491
00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.793 
tools, for example, the

492
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.500 
difficult offline password

493
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.729 
cracking, perfect forward

494
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.730 
secrecy

495
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.159 
property is used in others.

496
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.600 
So be careful, If

497
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.390 
you use your devices

498
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.160 
such as laptop or smartphone

499
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.500 
to connect to a Wi-Fi,

500
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.670 
you every time should use the

501
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.660 
WPA2

502
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.790 
or better  WPA3

503
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.540 
security protocol.

504
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.959 
This was a short overview

505
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.749 
to the wireless networks,

506
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.029 
which become more and more

507
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.619 
important and popular

508
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.049 
because it's so easy

509
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.320 
to connect to the Internet

510
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.369 
to interact also to use internet

511
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.370 
services, even if

512
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.390 
you are travelling

513
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.400 
or if you are away

514
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.819 
from your station computer.

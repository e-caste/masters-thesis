00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.930 
Hello and welcome to this mainframe MOOC session about Fujitsu BS2000 -

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the reliable and innovative platform for business critical applications.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.270 
My name is Felicitas Birkner, head of BS2000 Portfolio Management

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.180 
at Fujitsu. And over the next minutes I would like to give you a brief introduction

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.640 
about Fujitsu and mainframes in general

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.600 
and in a second part about the Fujitsu BS2000 mainframes in particular

7
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.990 
along with some thoughts about how to shape tomorrow with mainframes.

8
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.120 
Let me start with a short question. Do you have any affinity with mainframes?

9
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.230 
Probably more than you think. You likely did not realize it or

10
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.300 
you maybe already know about it, but you were dealing with mainframe

11
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.870 
technology in one way or another.

12
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.510 
For example when you are shopping at a supermarket or taking

13
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.880 
care of insurance and banking matters

14
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.890 
or booking a trip, driving your car or contacting government agencies

15
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.500 
or simply using some mobile devices.

16
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.310 
Generally speaking you are always in operation or

17
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.180 
mainframes are always in operation in processes where mass data

18
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.920 
needs to be processed with extreme reliability,

19
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.280 
so that thousands of transactions per second

20
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.400 
can be carried out on a robust fast secure and reliable way.

21
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.760 
With universal operational readiness

22
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.780 
has distinguished mainframes for more than fifty years

23
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.170 
and today this is increasingly more important,

24
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.430 
I think more than ever before.

25
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.540 
Why? Because without mainframes

26
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.580 
we would not be able to keep our digital society functioning so smoothly

27
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.540 
and with such a high degree on computing quality.

28
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.770 
Thanks to the mainframe platforms

29
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.280 
a number of concepts and key technologies emerged

30
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.210 
which is vital and still vital for today's IT operations.

31
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.710 
Multi-tasking and virtualization

32
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.120 
are two examples of computing disciplines

33
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.750 
in which mainframes function very perfectly.

34
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.760 
And with a few at Fujitsu mainframes and BS2000 also in particular

35
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.950 
over four decades,

36
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.810 
these mainframe systems have been further developed and constantly further developed

37
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.900 
resulting in a lot of innovations and key developments.

38
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.460 
It all starts with the foundation of the company Fujitsu.

39
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.050 
Fujitsu was founded in 1935 and did

40
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.380 
you know where Fujitsu originated from the communication division

41
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.330 
of Fujitsu Fuji electric company which was a joint venture

42
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.930 
of Fuji and Siemens.

43
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.070 
Here you can see that Fujitsu company

44
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.910 
was specialised

45
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.870 
just from the begin in the development of infrastructures for communications.

46
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.340 
And today - today it's a company, a powerful organization worldwide acting

47
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.330 
with about hundred forty thousand employees,

48
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.680 
supporting customer needs and demands in more than hundred countries.

49
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.420 
Twenty thousand of them for example are working in research and development

50
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.730 
and the Fujitsu group holds about seventy eight thousand patents worldwide.

51
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.010 
The central company vision

52
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.840 
is to create a human centric innovation

53
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.340 
for a human centric society

54
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.160 
in co-creation with partners, customers and all of the prospects and interests

55
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.400 
and Fujitsu is providing technology products, solutions and services and

56
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.820 
under the umbrella of the enterprise platform services

57
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.240 
is a complete portfolio of the mainframe systems and services

58
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.810 
combined providing server, operating system, software solutions

59
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.540 
and services within the business lines of VME third party businesses,

60
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.860 
third party services, global server and BS2000

61
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.250 
mainframes in particular.

62
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.810 
And if you are interested

63
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.100 
to get some more information and dive deeper into the world

64
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.130 
of Fujitsu BS2000

65
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.290 
and figure out what makes these systems the platform for tomorrow fitting today,

66
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.880 
its demands in a digital world

67
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.570 
and especially to figure out what's in for you,

68
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.550 
you are invited to follow the second part of the session.

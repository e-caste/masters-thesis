1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.380 
Let us consider wireless
networks. Wireless networks,

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.610 
wireless LAN for
the IEEE 802.11

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.090 
WIF standard. The
wireless local areas

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.490 
networks also called
wireless Ethernet.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.990 
That is a very popular
wireless network technology,

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.710 
which is classified
under the name WI-FI

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.140 
and specified in the
internet standard 802.11.

8
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.490 
This WIFI standard
IEEE 802.11

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.080 
was developed to
enable the user

10
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.400 
to interconnect
with each other

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.260 
in a wireless way and to
allow wireless data

12
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.970 
transmission on such a
local networks. So

13
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.290 
the standard specifies the
communication protocol

14
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.120 
on the lowest layers of
so wireless network.

15
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.800 
So it provides the
possibility that data

16
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.520 
can be sent by radio
signals. So 802.11 WIFI

17
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.800 
is now the most widely used
communication protocol

18
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
in wireless networks. If we
consider such a wireless local

19
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.990 
area network. Then, there are three
different types of components.

20
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.290 
We have some mobile devices,
also devises such as smart

21
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.180 
phones, the pads also the laptops,
that are able to transmit

22
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.110 
data by means of the
WIFI, of the wireless

23
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.830 
local area network technology.
Then, there is net antenna.

24
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.450 
Antenna, the WIFI antenna
is able to transmit

25
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.980 
and to receive a data by
means of radio signals.

26
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.810 
And then most important, base
station or access point,

27
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.840 
which allows the
devices to

28
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.510 
connect to each other and
to be connected to the

29
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.050 
internet. Here is
a base station

30
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.820 
We see antenna,
WIFI antenna.

31
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.720 
So the WIFI enable devices
can connect to the station,

32
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.420 
can send data and then the access
point is able to interconnect

33
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.220 
different mobile users. But as a
access point is also able to

34
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.660 
interconnect mobile users to
this stationary internet.

35
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.960 
Of course there are some basic
security risks when people

36
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.480 
working in wireless lines. As a
major security risk of such

37
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.390 
WIFI is the problem of
fundamentally difficult

38
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.810 
to protect messages and
to protect privacy

39
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.340 
in wireless networks.
The reason is simple,

40
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.790 
the data packages are
transmitted by radio links.

41
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.160 
Anyone who is in the range
can receives them,

42
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.100 
and then can analyze the content
or can try to manipulate these.

43
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.270 
So the security risk is
a constant danger.

44
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.650 
If one users use such mobile
networks and one has

45
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.330 
to be clear that there
is permanent danger.

46
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.130 
Also the data traffic
is monitored.

47
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.220 
So the safety a precautions
are essentially.

48
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.300 
A special care must be taken
when one is using public

49
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.320 
WIFI networks, in a hotel, in airport,
a railway station, or wherever.

50
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.360 
Such access to the internet
where such a public wifi

51
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.380 
is offered. There are some
well-known security mechanisms,

52
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.520 
that are used a when a
wireless lines are used.

53
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.820 
So there is wifi
encryption, which

54
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.590 
is particularly unsafe.
We will discuss this

55
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.290 
later. There is mac address
filtering, which is

56
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.000 
also unsafe. And there is a
technique of security mechanism

57
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.380 
of hiding the ESSID
and so the name

58
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.740 
of the mobile network is also
to be considered as unsafe.

59
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.940 
Generally caution when serving,
is that one has to use

60
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.170 
TLS/SSL encryption which
is also used for example

61
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.080 
internet when we work
with https instead

62
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.550 
of http. Moreover,
there more security

63
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.200 
techniques. for example, the
use of encrypted data tunnels

64
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.590 
so called VPNs, virtual
private networks,

65
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.480 
which also a are
recommended to use

66
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.310 
when one connecting
to the network

67
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.230 
while in such WIFI. Let's have a
closer look to is is well known

68
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.890 
security mechanisms and let's
start with WIFI encryption.

69
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.910 
This is an encryption of
traffic in a wireless network

70
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.880 
on the lowest network level.
The typical methodes

71
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.770 
which are in place
here is WEP, WPA,

72
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.360 
and WPA2.

73
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.510 
I'll go into more
details with WPA2.

74
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.090 
Because the two others are
not considered to be safe.

75
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.640 
So WEP and WPA are now
considered unsafe and

76
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.680 
when possible they should not
be used. Why is it should not

77
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.510 
be used? The WEP, for example,
can be correct within minutes.

78
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.880 
So incomplete access to
the network is possible,

79
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.280 
to all the data that are
transported there. If we look

80
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.190 
to WPA, it's prone to the
cracking of the individual

81
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.740 
data packets so it's possible
to at least the small

82
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.790 
part of the messages

83
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.480 
can be read by
the attacker.

84
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.760 
For that reason, let's
have a closer look to

85
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:52.520 
WPA2, which is currently widely
used as the encryption method.

86
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.560 
If possible, you
should use WPA-CCMP

87
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.200 
and not to use WPA-TKIP.
These are the

88
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.290 
differences encryption
methods coming with

89
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:16.190 
WPA2. Recent research
revealed also design flaw

90
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.040 
in the WPA2 protocol which
allows decryption, which are

91
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.650 
replay and forgery of packages.
But this very recent

92
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.990 
research. The
corresponding attack

93
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.960 
focused on a special scenario
for retransmission

94
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.650 
of messages during
a session key

95
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.930 
generation. Of course, for any
kind of encryption, a key needs

96
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.630 
to be calibrated, which is needed
cause encryption and that

97
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.170 
needs to be exchanged
between the users.

98
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.190 
So key reinstallation
attack, the KRACK attack,

99
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:02.900 
revealed server bucks in
several WPA2 handshake

100
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.650 
implementations. For example,
temporary session key is not

101
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.590 
re-installed but replaced
with all-zero season key.

102
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.040 
Session key is predictable and
allows packet injection.

103
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:23.600 
So these are the
weaknesses of WPA2, so

104
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.400 
in some implementation it can no
more considered to be secure.

105
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.460 
Interestingly, the attack
does not reveal the

106
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:39.920 
WIFI password. The CRACK
incident shows that even

107
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.490 
mathematically proven protocols
could be affected by design

108
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.580 
flaws which have not been covered
by the underlying model.

109
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.540 
When such a protocol
mathematica is proved, there

110
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.200 
are some assumption made and on
the basis of the assumption,

111
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.910 
then mathematical proof is given
that this method is secure.

112
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.260 
This was done
and for WPA2,

113
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:13.460 
because of the special
situation as people find out

114
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.710 
that the model was not complete,
and an attack was possible.

115
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.700 
so expert stated that all
clients have to be updated

116
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.270 
to secure WPA2
again. The

117
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.780 
updated version of this
protocol to at least

118
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.840 
make it impossible to use
this type of attack.

119
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.720 
additionally beside of
updating the clients,

120
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.520 
when using WPA2,
one should

121
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:49.380 
use strong passwords. because
weak password can be cracked

122
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.340 
in a short time and then fully
network access is possible.

123
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.680 
perhaps you remember
that in week

124
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:04.440 
two we had a excursion which
shows that the speed

125
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.250 
rate of one million
operation in the second.

126
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.810 
it is easily possible to get
access to the network.

127
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.010 
and then one should
use unique network

128
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.970 
named. This is ESSID,
as frequently used

129
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.000 
ESSIDs ease the deduction
of the passwords.

130
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.610 
WPS, another problem
of WIFI encryption.

131
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.120 
that is ok the WIFI
protected set up

132
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.870 
is a process for all supposedly
secure key exchange.

133
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.700 
Also it helps the user
to implement these

134
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.150 
methods so one has to
entering a password

135
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.880 
for WPA, WPA2 and
this is made easier

136
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.640 
by means of
simpler methods.

137
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.570 
so what has to enter a pin and
then pressing a button on the

138
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:09.020 
router. but the method, which
should help to increase

139
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.060 
security to make the implementation
and configurations, the gritty

140
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.220 
configuration more easy.
but methods have major

141
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.270 
vulnerabilities that
allow penetration

142
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:28.740 
into the network. for that
reason, this method, the WPS

143
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.330 
protocol should be
disabled on the router.

144
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.590 
not to provide an
attack part.

145
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.930 
when I mentioned some wellknown
security mechanisms i spoke

146
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.860 
about MAC address filtering. what
his MAC address filtering?

147
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.490 
Frequently proposed
security method,

148
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.410 
which allows only the specific
devices to connect to a network.

149
00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.630 
and in this way the idea is
to exclude cybercriminals.

150
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.410 
the idea is that
the router

151
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.670 
needs to be configered in such
a way that the hardware

152
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:17.050 
address of each device must be
registered in the router before the

153
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.540 
router connect that device
to the mobile network.

154
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.970 
it was shown that the protection
in this way or by means of

155
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.550 
mac address filtering is
not effective enough.

156
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.750 
and the reason is simple, the reason
is, that the hardware address

157
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:41.680 
of a device can easily be changed
and cybercriminals can listen

158
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.240 
to the address of an
authorised devise

159
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.630 
by the traffic and then

160
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.220 
connect themselves to the
network with the addresses

161
00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.250 
of authorised device.
Otherwise, we know

162
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:05.650 
security mechanisms that proposed
to be applied working and

163
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.580 
configuring wireless data
networks is to hide

164
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.660 
the network name. the
network named ESSID.

165
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:22.060 
this is a proposed mechanism
which that the devices

166
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.230 
that one to connect to a network
need to know the name of

167
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.620 
the network. so only devices that
knows the network name that knows

168
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.910 
the ESSID can connect
to the network.

169
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.860 
so the ESSID must be
end up manually

170
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.620 
when setting up the connection. but
also this is not very efficient.

171
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.820 
and the reason is the network
traffic and the ESSID

172
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.650 
can be intercepted and detected
with appropriate software.

173
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.830 
as soon as the ESSID
is discovered,

174
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:01.970 
then also attackers can connect to
the network with their machines.

175
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.320 
What is the recommendation: the
caution when serving. So the general

176
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.100 
caution when serving is
use TLS/SSL encryption.

177
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.510 
when serving on public networks,
you should be aware you should

178
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.760 
be principal a rare that everyone
can listen what you are

179
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.220 
doing and even if you
use as mobile network.

180
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.320 
only to connect to the
stationary internet.

181
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.720 
You need to be
clear that

182
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.980 
entrance point in this wireless
line is possible for everyone

183
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.930 
to listen what you are doing. even
if a public network is encrypted.

184
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.590 
for example, in a restaurant
and or an auto WIFI.

185
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:56.000 
everyone in that network
can read along.

186
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:01.740 
therefore, sensitive data
should only be accessed via

187
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:07.900 
encrypted connection. and ensure
that you are serving with HTTPS.

188
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.730 
this is http
over TLS/SSL.

189
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.730 
Therefore, sensitive data should a
only sent via encrypted connection

190
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.560 
i said already be sure to use
an TLS/SSL as connection

191
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.730 
particularly when
you inputting user

192
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:35.650 
and possword data. You
should use this TLS/SSL

193
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.770 
connection on the
looking page itself

194
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.040 
already by logging
in page itself

195
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.500 
should already be TLS/SSL
scured and not only after

196
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.470 
the login took place,
because the log in data

197
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.910 
are very sensitive. Be
sure that TLS/SSL

198
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.300 
connections are used to connect
with the e-mails server,

199
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:12.070 
so your email program should
be configured in such

200
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:17.360 
way that only such email, such
TLS/SSL connections are allowed.

201
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:23.200 
messager apps sometimes also use an
encrypted connections to communicate,

202
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:27.050 
be very careful
when you use it.

203
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.070 
some successful
security mechanisms

204
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.730 
are virtual private
networks.

205
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.290 
the use of such encrypted
data terminals,

206
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:47.660 
virtual private networks
are called VPNs.

207
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:53.930 
Not all services and websites
are available in an encrypted

208
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.420 
form, so an encrypted
communication channel

209
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:03.170 
in the form of such in VPN can
protect all data, so one

210
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:08.640 
needs to access to services
by means of such an

211
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.980 
encrypted data channel. Such an VPN
is a virtual encrypted network

212
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:20.750 
to built on an existing open
networks, it encrypts data

213
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:26.070 
stream which sent over a normal,
unencrypted connection.

214
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.970 
In this way we speak from
tunneling, so an open

215
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.750 
everyone accessible, for everyone
accessible data connected

216
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:41.880 
connection line is used
in a encrypted way.

217
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.920 
so secure internal network
can also be made available

218
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:53.250 
to remote users via vpn if you
want to allow, for example home

219
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:59.480 
office, work and access
was system from a public

220
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.910 
wireless network by means of
such virtual private networks.

221
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.410 
There is the possibility
to connect,

222
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:12.450 
also to secure into the networks
what you need is the corresponding

223
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.410 
software which allowed
to run such an vpn.

224
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.310 
The problem here is that
such vpn are usually

225
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.630 
more difficult to set
up before they can

226
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:34.900 
be used. what do the recommendations,
what do the safety precautions

227
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.220 
should have, first speaking
about private life is

228
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.550 
here it's necessary to
update the devices

229
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.510 
to prove this mentioned
KRACK attack.

230
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.310 
so you need the latest
version software versions

231
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.940 
to be secure against this
attack. then use of WPA2-CCMP

232
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:03.870 
encryption in the private
area, then of cause strong

233
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.790 
password needs to be
elected and this

234
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.630 
is not a problem, because this
possible is to need to be entered

235
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.500 
only once in
the device.

236
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.500 
and then this
is WPS which

237
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.900 
should be off, it's a
router so that WPS,

238
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.030 
there's no way to
attack your device.

239
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.230 
and you're your data and
your content. optional is,

240
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.280 
option recommendation
is to hide the ESSID.

241
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.140 
this is not a providing a lot of
security, but it makes a little

242
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.440 
bit more difficult for
their attack to see

243
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.880 
what's what kind of data you are
sending and to listen what

244
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.070 
you are doing. when we speak
about public Wi-Fis,

245
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.290 
then one should use an
encrypted connections

246
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.410 
and forgoing
unencrypted services,

247
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:12.140 
then sensitive data is exchanged
to better use a virtual

248
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:18.230 
private network there when
running such public networks.

249
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.870 
So wireless networks are
very convenient but

250
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:31.970 
you has to take special care
about using such a wireless

251
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.390 
such wifi networks
in a secure way.

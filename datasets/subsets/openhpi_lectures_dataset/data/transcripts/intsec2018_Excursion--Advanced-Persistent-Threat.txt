1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.860 
in this excursion, we want
to have a closer look

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.630 
to advanced persistent
threats. so-called APT

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.750 
so it's not necessary
to consider this,

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.370 
but if you are interested
and if you are like to

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.410 
understand some of the
media, press media,

6
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.480 
news in more detail. perhaps
it's interesting to

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.190 
understand what such APTs are.
What they are corrected for.

8
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
APT- advanced persistent
threat is a targeted the

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.930 
attack, for example on the government,
military industry, authorities

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.500 
or activities and it's camouflaged
and it's extremely sophisticated

11
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.410 
attack methods. So, this is a
difference to the attacks

12
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.370 
we discussed. Everyone

13
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.190 
in their hack castine is
able to designs this, to

14
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.940 
performs this. But it is APTs.
they need very sophisticated

15
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.130 
people they made the read sources.
So is often the basis are

16
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.390 
exploited of an unknown
vulnerabilities. You remember this

17
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.200 
0 days. The vulnerabilities typically
when they become known then

18
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.190 
the companies software
when those immediately

19
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.060 
design and develop
such a updates.

20
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.820 
But if the vulnerability is unknown
and the vendor has no reason

21
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.530 
to develop such an update,
so such "0 days"

22
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.060 
are very in the hacker's
world, they hacked it,

23
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.930 
and very expensive and for
such APTs, often such

24
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.190 
unknown vulnerabilities are
used. Backdoor in software are

25
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.860 
used sometimes not clear whether
a government insisted that

26
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.790 
software provider
designed such backdoors

27
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.440 
inside the software. The
characteristic of this APTs is to be

28
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.180 
created in warm and also of
social engineering methods.

29
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.160 
For example, the spear
phishing this was very

30
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.650 
a dedicated phishing
attack to a person,

31
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.530 
after a long period of
spying out this person.

32
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.990 
Mostly such
APT run over

33
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.950 
a long period of time
staying undetected

34
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.200 
and can in this way
do their work.

35
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.960 
For example, maintain
a prominent excess

36
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.040 
to the targets, to the
written systems. They slow

37
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.940 
and step down approach
to prevent detection.

38
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.860 
So they are very
carefully hidden.

39
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.570 
So the victim does
not become aware

40
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.140 
that he or she is attacked.
APTs are usually motivated

41
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.890 
by extensive espionage much
of sensitive information.

42
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.990 
it is going to be
interviewed of economy

43
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.020 
in the field of industrial or
political espionage etc.

44
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.620 
So in impairment of destruction
of critical infrastructure:

45
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.040 
oil, gas, electricity,
telecommunications. These are the goals

46
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.210 
of such APTs. And the profile
of the attackers are,

47
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.630 
these attackers have
access to extremely

48
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.460 
extensive and extremely
expensive resource.

49
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.240 
Virtually they can do or
what we want to do is the

50
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.360 
the financial resources. And it's
large teams. A large teams of

51
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.350 
professional hackers set
a working designing

52
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.260 
and performing such an
attack. So the guess is,

53
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.690 
the behind such APTs is the
governmental organization

54
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.050 
or it is large company
or it is military.

55
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.280 
So there is very big
entities set perform

56
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.570 
such APTs. So APTs in
this way go far beyond

57
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.660 
the text we discussed in our
course. What are the patterns

58
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.330 
of attacks? So APTs are
highly specialized attacks

59
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.510 
and the main objective is
attack must not be detected.

60
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.780 
The attack is so expensive
and is attacking

61
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.600 
such an important thing. That
must not be attackted.

62
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.230 
It's characteristic that generally
unknown or very rarely

63
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.710 
used attack tools are in
place. In some cases the

64
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.850 
attacked tools
are developed

65
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.730 
by the attackers, by
the attacker teams.

66
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.990 
The APTs are characterized
by injection of malicious

67
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.200 
code to to victims by means
of very personalized

68
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.190 
social engineering attacks. For
example something in military

69
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.630 
sometimes over months.
In general is

70
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.990 
spied out and all the
information about his personal

71
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.680 
life, professional life
are connected. So then

72
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.210 
the fishing mails are designed
so is that this person

73
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.320 
believes it comes from a
brother or are from mother or

74
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.060 
from a colleague or and rather than
other person. The victims are scouted

75
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.440 
out over months. This is the
characteristic of APT.

76
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.450 
The characteristic is
that malicious software

77
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.560 
using exploited for unknown as
security vulnerabilities.

78
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.790 
These unknown vulnerabilities
is so called zero days.

79
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.220 
There is a black market and
there are huge prizes one has

80
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.670 
to pay a it to get access
to such an zero exploited

81
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.030 
often connected with the
guarantee that no one else

82
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.840 
can knows these vulnerabilities or
can buy these vulnerabilities.

83
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.290 
So APT attacks are almost
impossible to detect.

84
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.000 
Generally accessible protection
software for example a anti-virus

85
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.220 
software or firewalls do
not yet to recognise APTs

86
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.910 
and are therefore ineffective to
protect systems against APTs.

87
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
So APTs are in a different
class of attacks

88
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.120 
which is designed and
which is run a performed

89
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.890 
by a very big entity. The
exploited vulnerabilities

90
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.910 
remain generally unrecognized
so when I latter start

91
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.460 
to show you an example, we
can see more details.

92
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.120 
I want to give you two examples.
The first example is stuxnet.

93
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.460 
i'm quite sure you have
heard about Stuxnet.

94
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.810 
It is a malicious software
which was discovered in 2010

95
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.810 
on the computers of Iranian
uranium enrichment facilities.

96
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:50.670 
Stuxnet exploited a number
of unknown, up to that

97
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:56.070 
time, unknown security by vulnerabilities.
For example it has exploited

98
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.910 
4 security vulnerabilities in
windows operating system.

99
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:06.450 
it exploited the further vulnerability
in the industry control

100
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:12.640 
software SCADA. This scada was used
for the uranium centrifuges.

101
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.040 
The centrifuge is to produce
Iranian atom bomb.

102
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.600 
And what was possible
by means of stuxnet

103
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.600 
malware worms was to call
these worms become

104
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.820 
faster and faster faster
up to the moment.

105
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.960 
Till it became destroyed. At the
time, attacks on industry control

106
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.870 
systems were only
addressed as a legend

107
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.320 
in some research papers. Nobody
was aware that also in this

108
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.490 
industry controlled
system. it's possible

109
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:55.710 
it to perform cyberattacks.
Social engineering was used for

110
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.440 
the initial infection.
Initial infection was

111
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.830 
caused by hand over of a USB
stick with concealed stuxnet.

112
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.160 
And then, the
goal of attack,

113
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.020 
obviously goal of
attack was disruption

114
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.840 
of the Iranian nuclear/uranium
enrichment program.

115
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.930 
The first version of
stuxnet warm appeared

116
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.640 
in June 2009. But it was
not yet recognized

117
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.170 
as Stuxnet at that time. Then
it run until july 2010

118
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.750 
after more than one year
without being detected.

119
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.110 
To design such an
attack, to design such

120
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.600 
a exploited needs a huge
amount of resources.

121
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.320 
So early assumption came
in that was in state

122
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.750 
infrastructure was
behind this attack.

123
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.440 
And according to add was Snowden
and his sayings the us and

124
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.950 
israel where behind this attack.
And the second example of an APT

125
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:22.740 
It's APT1. It is the name
of an espionage division

126
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:29.160 
that has carried out APT
attacks on at least 141

127
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:35.160 
international companies. Secret
documents, secret data, development

128
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:42.700 
data were stolen over years.
And APT1 was revealed

129
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.990 
in February 2013 by
security company

130
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:53.020 
Mandiant and it's
evidence suggests

131
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.750 
that attack was underway
since ride a long time

132
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:05.840 
since 2006. The attacker
to design such an attack

133
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.080 
to perform such a big and
very many resources

134
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.510 
at their disposal, the assumption:
a state was behind the attack.

135
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.660 
Because other parties do not
have so much excess to so much

136
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.330 
resources. So i mean why is
attacked properly a originated in

137
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.310 
china: special
espionage division

138
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.710 
61.398 of the
people's liberation

139
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:39.350 
army where active and designed this.
So this two examples show that

140
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.120 
APTs are very
special attacks

141
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.700 
designed who was the power of
the state over the power of a

142
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.050 
huge company of military. So it's
a different class compared

143
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.990 
to the attacks we discussed
before. As a private person,

144
00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.420 
typically you are not a
goal of such APT attack.

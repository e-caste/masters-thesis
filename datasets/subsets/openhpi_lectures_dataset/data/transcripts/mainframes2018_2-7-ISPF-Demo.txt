00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.149 
Hello, it's me again, Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.940 
and in the next session, I want to give you a short demonstration on

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.799 
how to work with ISPF, the interactive system

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.569 
productivity facility, it's a tool with the character

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.249 
based menu oriented tool, to work

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.099 
in a TSO environment.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.379 
So again, I do it with Virtel, it is 3270

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.979 
emulation, working in a browser installed on the server side and

9
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.979 
the big advantages you don't have to install any emulation

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.109 
on your workstation.

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.999 
So, I'm in the browser now, I just click on TSO, and

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.649 
here I got the message from TSO that I should enter my user

13
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.999 
I.D.. What I do now, UWGR.

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.539 
is my user I.D. I have to give in my password

15
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.329 
and I'm connected to our system with a message from

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.819 
RACF, the security server.

17
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.559 
There's two messages from TSO and then the three

18
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.419 
asterisk telling me that there is some more

19
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.949 
information. If I put the enter key, I do that

20
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.849 
now and now I'm already in ISPF.

21
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.409 
So it is done in many installations, so that you directly invoke

22
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.149 
ISPF because it's normally makes no sense at all

23
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.079 
to work interactively with TSO commands.

24
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.359 
And in this case, we get the so-called System Master Application menu.

25
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.099 
This is a menu showing you a lot of possibilities, a lot of types

26
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.629 
to choose from, depending on what you want to do.

27
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.339 
Just to give you a short overview, we have the interface to

28
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.349 
see the security server.

29
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.849 
We have an administrative interface the ISMF, the Interactive Storage

30
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.739 
Management Facility. We have an interactive

31
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.299 
interface to the interactive problem control facility for

32
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.869 
the packing and so on. Interface to monitoring and so on.

33
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.879 
A lot of a lot of possibilities.

34
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.409 
So, this structure depends

35
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.019 
on the so-called dialog manager, how many and what kind of

36
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.359 
applications you include in your ISPF environment.

37
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.859 
And in many cases, you have one possibility to go to

38
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.121 
the PDF, remember the PDF, the

39
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.729 
program development facility as an interactive editor.

40
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.679 
I choose now P as PDF and here stands for program

41
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.892 
development facility. And when I put on P, this is coming now.

42
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.999 
Many users are accustomed to this interface because

43
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.339 
this is a standardized interface that is shown in all installations.

44
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.019 
So it's a big advantage, in my opinion, that if I go to a customer site

45
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.489 
and want to do an introduction course or something where I

46
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.049 
need the ISPF, I find an environment

47
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.609 
where I'm accustomed to and I can do all the edit stuff and what I want

48
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.064 
to do. Now, this is the ISPF primary option

49
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.339 
menu, where I can choose from what I want to do.

50
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.809 
And in many cases, one of the utilities you

51
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.229 
really often use normally is to see

52
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.699 
the dataset list utility.

53
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.979 
I just show you how to get there.

54
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.429 
We can do it in different ways.

55
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.509 
We can first type in 3.

56
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.619 
We want to go to the utilities submenu.

57
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.779 
Now we see the Utilities Selection Panel and here we can type for

58
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.111 
the dataset list.

59
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.220 
We have some program function keys and to get back here, we have

60
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.579 
the function-3 key. I types the function-3 key now, I get back

61
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.139 
to the Utilities Selection Panel and once again function three, I

62
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.659 
get back to the primary option menu.

63
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.309 
And if know where to go and in this example I have shown

64
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.229 
you 3 is utilities, 4 is the list

65
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.561 
submenu. I can also type now 3.4 and

66
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.139 
go directly to this DAS list menu

67
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.669 
and here I am. Again it's the same menu I've showed you

68
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.670 
before.

69
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.829 
And what now can be done, you can

70
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.669 
type in the DAS name level. It means the data

71
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.088 
sets are shown beginning with UWGR as example,

72
00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.549 
it is just my high level qualifier. And now when I type the enter key, I

73
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.219 
get a list of all my datasets.

74
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.869 
I go back again with function key 3 and type in this case,

75
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.280 
UWGR.TEST because I have some data sets beginning with UWGR.TEST.

76
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.379 
I select these now and press the enter

77
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.110 
key and now you'll see I get just

78
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.790 
the data sets presented, beginning with

79
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.649 
UWGR.TEST. Now I can go into one of these

80
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.910 
rows and say as example in this case,

81
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.419 
I want to view what is in UWGR.TEST.COBOL, and

82
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.809 
now I see the so-called member list, if you remember

83
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.856 
what Professor Brune told you in the dataset,

84
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.799 
data management and dataset recession

85
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.219 
that in this case we broke with PDS, partitioned dataset.

86
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.658 
Partitioned means we have a dataset, a dataset now has the name UWGR.TEST.COBOL

87
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.939 
and what we see now is a list of this dataset means

88
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.439 
we view into the directory of this dataset and the PDS

89
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.909 
has a directory with members and in this case, this is some member list.

90
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.469 
And now I want to select from the member list one of

91
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.509 
these members and as example, I

92
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.709 
want to edit now our Hello member.

93
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.179 
And now you'll see, let's get rid of this

94
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.619 
message. Now we see the COBOL

95
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.249 
program, and this is a very short

96
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.308 
COBOL program that is possible,

97
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.799 
just display hello something.

98
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.300 
You can see this is nothing more than the Hello World

99
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.319 
application. In this case display Hello Mainframe at European

100
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.789 
Mainframe Academy. I want to compile

101
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.979 
this member now, I have to go into another dataset

102
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.109 
with JCL in it.

103
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.579 
Job control again, I would say, normally I'd say view the

104
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.889 
dataset and here I have a member

105
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.779 
so there is a CNG, it means COBOL, compile,

106
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.519 
link and go. I want to compile, link, edit and execute

107
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.109 
COBOL program in this case, you say again

108
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.299 
E as edit.

109
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.210 
And here now you'll see the JCL, the

110
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.245 
JCL now has a job

111
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.999 
statement, and in this job statement, we define how our job is named

112
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.859 
and some other information. And in this case, you'll see with the DD,

113
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.418 
data definition statement, we see DSN means dataset name

114
00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.979 
equals UWGR.TEST:COBOL, it was

115
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.538 
exactly the dataset we just used, and the member in this case

116
00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:48.699 
is hello. And if I say SUB now, SUB means submit,

117
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.169 
submit this JCL and then this JCL is

118
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.769 
submitted. It is sent to the job

119
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.289 
entry subsystem and with the job entry subsystem, it goes through the

120
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.779 
phases we already talked about.

121
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.380 
And in this case, now I say submit, we see again

122
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.149 
the IKJ message from TSO, job UWGRC and

123
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.390 
jop number that is

124
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.949 
assigned by the job entry subsystem.

125
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.620 
And in this case, our job number is

126
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.829 
7259. OK again, we get already a message that the job ended

127
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.991 
and a quite good message we get here is MAXCC=0

128
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.709 
and MAXCC stands for Maximum Condition Code,

129
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.539 
it means we have no flex, no warnings, no error statements

130
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.209 
within our compiled job.

131
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.989 
Maximum condition coding zero sounds good.

132
00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.535 
OK, now let's go to the SDSF.

133
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:09.009 
I mentioned SDSF also in our job management

134
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.959 
section. So I can split screen into two.

135
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.459 
Again, I get the Master Application Menu and in this master application

136
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.619 
menu we have one point we can select is

137
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.629 
SD for SDSF, system display and search facility.

138
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:33.099 
I do it now, SD. And with SD now it depends on

139
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.079 
your authorities, of course.

140
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.751 
On our own system at the Leipzig University,

141
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.299 
I have a lot of authorities.

142
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.009 
Normally if you have access to such an environment

143
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.509 
in your own company, normally you don't have all these

144
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.759 
possibilities to select from.

145
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.649 
You just have a subset, but normally what

146
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.079 
in each and every case you have is the many

147
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.019 
appoint H for health output queue.

148
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.609 
And if I now press ,H health output queue and enter.

149
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.079 
I'll see what output is in my queue and in this case,

150
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.909 
you'll see this was our job number and when we select

151
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.379 
now S, for show me the output

152
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.449 
I produced with this job. You see now this is the Hello Mainframe

153
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.419 
at European Mainframe Academy.

154
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.420 
OK.

155
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.469 
This was a very short introduction and demonstration to

156
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.470 
ISPF.

157
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.219 
Yeah, have fun, and I hope we see

158
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.309 
us in one of our next video clips.

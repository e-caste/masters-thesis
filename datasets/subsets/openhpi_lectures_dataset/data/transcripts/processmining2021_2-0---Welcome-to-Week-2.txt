00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.730 
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure
to welcome you to the second week

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.530 
of our online course "Step-by-step
Introduction to Process Mining".

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.470 
My name is Henrik Leopold and I am
a professor at the KÃ¼hne Logistics

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.340 
University in Hamburg and senior
researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute

5
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.230 
at the University
of Potsdam.

6
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.470 
In this clip I would like to
introduce the video clips that

7
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.000 
we have prepared
for week two.

8
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.310 
So, as you can see we have
prepared ten clips

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.630 
with five main topics. So
the first topic that we

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.230 
will delve into is the topic of quality
dimensions in clips one and two.

11
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.290 
We will first look into the quality, the
basic mechanism of quality dimensions.

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.820 
So we would like to discuss whether a
process model that we have discovered

13
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.550 
is good or not. So we will introduce
some objective measures

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.700 
and then in a second clip we will apply
these quality dimensions to illustrate

15
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.140 
how these quality dimensions
work in practice.

16
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.310 
The second topic in clips three, four and
five is the topic of conformance checking.

17
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
So, as you remember from week one, conformance
checking is concerned with comparing

18
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.150 
a blueprint process model that
captures how the intended process

19
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.090 
that captures how we want the
process to be executed and the

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.620 
event log on the other hand where we see how
the process has been actually executed.

21
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.100 
We will discuss different facets. We will
talk about the objective in clip three,

22
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.820 
we will talk about the basic
principle in clip four and we

23
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.070 
will discuss the insights we can
obtain from conformance checking

24
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.380 
in clip number five. Then we turn to
the topic of decision mining and

25
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.950 
we discuss how other aspects than
the control for perspective can

26
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.710 
help us and provide valuable feedback
in the context of process mining.

27
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.990 
So the control for perspective is
concerned with the order of

28
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.470 
activities and in this clip
decision mining we will look into

29
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.950 
decisions which relate more to the
data perspective and we will show

30
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.210 
why decisions matter and
we will show how we can

31
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.320 
mine decisions meaning that we
want to understand how decisions

32
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.980 
are being taken and how we can
predict these decisions based

33
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.730 
on data that is available
about our cases.

34
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140 
Then we will turn to the topic of time
prediction in clip number seven where

35
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.010 
we are interested in looking
into the future so to say. So

36
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.510 
we would like to predict how long will
still running cases take until completion

37
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920 
and you can imagine that this is
something that we are often

38
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.970 
interested in real life. How long does
it take until I get my decision,

39
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.360 
how long does it take until I
get feedback, how long does it

40
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.900 
take until my issue is. So
these are aspects that relate

41
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.620 
to time prediction and we will give
an introduction to that topic

42
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.790 
in clip number seven.

43
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.390 
Then in clip number eight and nine,
we will turn to practical aspects.

44
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.110 
We will focus on conformance
checking and we'll look both at

45
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.850 
how to do this manually and how to do
this automatically and we will use

46
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.700 
a real process mining tool to
illustrate this in more detail

47
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.470 
to also show how the aspects
in the concept that

48
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.690 
we have discussed here can be used
in practice and with real world

49
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.630 
data. Then in the last clip we
will summarize week two and

50
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.670 
again provide an overview of the
things that we have explained

51
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.450 
in this week.

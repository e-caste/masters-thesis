00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.560 
So talking about networked
organization, we all know that

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.530 
most of us are not part of a networked
organization and are more a

3
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.120 
part of the Brockhaus
organization and we get

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.050 
get asked often,
What to do, How do

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.990 
we get out of this kind of
traditional analogue structure into

6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.580 
a networked organization. One of our
first answers to this question is,

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.250 
start to open a space, a kind of
protected space to fail, which

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
we could call the
Design-Thinking space

9
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.180 
and which is a
different areas.

10
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.380 
This is what actually we tried
to set up when we started

11
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.020 
the D School 12
years ago.

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.080 
The idea was to have a space
where no domain dominates,

13
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.920 
but every person should
feel welcomed.

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.630 
This is somehow how we
developed our next steps and

15
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.670 
this is what we are trying to
bring also to organizations, to

16
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.930 
give yourself an idea and
invite all the people

17
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.560 
to think of that kind of space
which is first of all welcoming

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.400 
and not giving any domain the
priority. When creating that space

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.120 
that actually allows for failure
you're also expressing that you're

20
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.780 
about to do a cultural change.
Creating those safe spaces

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.060 
to try out and test is an
expression of this specific move.

22
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.570 
We found out through the last
years that there are four very

23
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.150 
important areas to look
at regarding the space.

24
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.770 
The first one is actually the
place where people meet, the

25
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.770 
workspace or the team
space which is basically

26
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.060 
a larger table flexible enough
to move it around and have

27
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.630 
a standing position like
ours, surrounded by lots of

28
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.090 
pieces to visualize like the
whiteboards in our case.

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.400 
And the second one is the main space this
is actually the space dedicated for teams

30
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.250 
to build not just products but also
services and even strategies,

31
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.090 
because once you start
thinking with your hands

32
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.950 
it actually empowers you to go
beyond. The third part of

33
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.780 
the space after the teams have
gathered, got their ideas together,

34
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.020 
and went to the prototyping space
and did the physical things

35
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.180 
is the shared space. It is the place
where people meet, where the

36
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.500 
teams share with the other teams
what the outcome is. Actually

37
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.940 
it is a long way to go in
organisations and companies to make

38
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.570 
people aware that sharing is very
very important and actually

39
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.950 
physical sharing not just the
digital. And the fourth one is,

40
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.450 
the networked space that goes
far beyond just informal

41
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.010 
meetings and small kitchens. It's
about creating a dedicated

42
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.280 
room where people can have random
as well as planned encounters

43
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.080 
to informally exchange
about learnings but also

44
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.130 
to gain further inspiration from
having conversations with others

45
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.150 
beyond their teams, but also
with clients or customers were

46
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.040 
invited to become part of that
shared space experience.

47
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.810 
You might have realised that all the
four spaces we were describing

48
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.840 
have nothing to do with IQ,
they're all focused on WQ

49
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.750 
or the weak qualities. This is
because we are all in a learning

50
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.220 
the environment here at the school
of Design Thinking, and first

51
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.320 
of all focusing on the learning
experience of every individual towards

52
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.330 
WQ. Because we're so much
grounded in the IQ world that

53
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.660 
it's very important to do that kind
of step in a working environment

54
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.530 
that will probably not work completely.
Yes we do have to have this kind of

55
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.530 
WQ spaces and it should be
much more than we have

56
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.250 
today, but we also still need
the IQ spaces. We need the two

57
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.670 
spaces, we need the little environments
where we can come up with

58
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.340 
ideas on our own.

59
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.750 
It also can be used
for focused work

60
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.870 
when it comes to the individual but
also for teams. So, therefore,

61
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.510 
when it comes to transferring this into
your organizational environment,

62
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.140 
it's also about trying to find a good
balance in terms of having WQ spaces

63
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.700 
that is different, but still
acceptable for your employees to

64
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.000 
work in because they somehow still
fit into the organizational

65
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.700 
culture as a whole. You might find out
why we are installing this kind of

66
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
protected space to fail the Design
Thinking space, the WQ area

67
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.490 
that a lot of people coming into that
space, making new experiences,

68
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.230 
moving back to their normal office
space, would love to integrate

69
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.590 
some of the experiences they had
in their normal environment.

70
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.160 
But we see also a lot of companies
approaching us and they

71
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.750 
are saying its a nice idea but
we don't have space available

72
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.880 
for our people.
So what to do,

73
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.060 
do they have a chance to move
forward? Yes, I think they can,

74
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.210 
because you can always start
small, so for example if

75
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.150 
you're planning a meeting, why
not do this without any chairs

76
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.370 
at a coffee table.

77
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.030 
Yeah, but how to implement
make space for example,

78
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.480 
how can you do this? I mean
what you could do is grab the

79
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.680 
lego of your kids and bring it
to the office in order to be

80
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.450 
able to build
something.

81
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.150 
I think there's a lot of
opportunities, a lot of

82
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.730 
potential if you just think of
how to get yourself more in

83
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.000 
an agile mode or
active mode.

84
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.190 
We would suggest
that it's always

85
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.720 
best to try it out in a very popular
space, go to your cafeteria

86
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.120 
and make it there, where all
people are stepping back.

87
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.570 
Yeah because then also it's
going to be made visible that

88
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.840 
you are really changing your
organizational culture by making

89
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.780 
use of your space.

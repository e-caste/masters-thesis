1
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.110 
2020 has been one of the most
challenging years in modern history

2
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.160 
It began with
a pandemic

3
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.540 
which has triggered fundamental
gaps in many of the important

4
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.100 
systems that we've
been reliant

5
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.060 
It revealed gaps in
the social systems

6
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.330 
It revealed gaps
in health care

7
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.260 
It revealed gaps
in education

8
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.330 
It revealed gaps
in politics

9
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
And all of these gaps

10
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.730 
require fundamental change, not
just the products and services

11
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.180 
but the systems
themselves

12
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.530 
Designers have a unique opportunity
and I believe unique responsibility

13
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.130 
to address these
fundamental gaps

14
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.880 
to take the existing situations
and design preferred futures,

15
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.550 
futures where we have
more social equality

16
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.070 
where we have
more access

17
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.750 
to just and affordable
healthcare

18
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.090 
where we have access
to education

19
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.750 
and of course where we have more
balanced political discourse

20
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.920 
These challenges, I believe, designers
can contribute to solve it

21
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.300 
Now in order for us to solve
though, we need to be thinking

22
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.360 
systematically but we also need to be
thinking about our craft of making things

23
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.370 
finding the balance
between those two

24
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.210 
systems which is very abstract, very
complex and the objects that we create

25
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.670 
the interfaces, the
products, the services

26
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.390 
binding those balances requires us
to be able to engage in design

27
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.890 
conversations
with each other

28
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.060 
that are filled with
give and take

29
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.510 
which have critique as
an engine for learning

30
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.650 
and most importantly

31
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.010 
aiming for a shared understanding
of shared language

32
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.340 
shared meaning between people
who are involved in designing

33
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.210 
these new systems

34
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.460 
If we are able to achieve that then
i believe designers can mobilize

35
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.080 
people for collective action and
this is exactly what's needed

36
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.150 
to address the fundamental
issues that had been revealed

37
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.450 
in this year. Now, it's
not an easy task

38
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.880 
but what we need to be doing is thinking
about design in different ways

39
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.470 
and that's what this course is
all about, that's what these

40
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.860 
conversations
are all about

41
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.070 
It's not looking at design of creating more
ideas but actually getting people engaged

42
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.780 
in co-creating
those ideas

43
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.480 
It's not just about visualizing
our ideas and putting more

44
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.120 
post-it on the walls

45
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.190 
It's all about engaging in constructive
and critical conversations

46
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.030 
that help us learn about the things that
we're making but also learn about ourselves

47
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.720 
and if we're able to do that
then i think we can go beyond

48
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.050 
what design has become in
many cases- a "buzzword"

49
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.060 
a language without any
real substance behind it

50
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.080 
Design is all about co-creating
shared meaning. A shared meaning

51
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.260 
means that their shared understanding,
there's a common language

52
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.440 
that does not mean that
everyone has to agree

53
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.610 
but there is more harmonization,
there's a synchronization

54
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.450 
between the people that are
engaged in co-designing

55
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.450 
these new systems. These are the areas
that we need to be focusing on

56
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.520 
as a design community and I truly hope
that this course will contribute

57
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.390 
to opening up ideas, opening up thoughts
and opening up the kinds of conversations

58
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.000 
that we need to mobilize our collective
strength to help contribute

59
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.910 
to taking the existing situations
and designing preferred futures

60
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.280 
So, I think what's interesting when
we look at the role design is

61
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.040 
starting to play more of in
an innovation process is

62
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.210 
NUMBER 1- To be able to set
out a more desirable future

63
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.790 
so within the design thinking literature,
we always quote Herbert A. Simon

64
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.530 
that anyone designs who changes existing
situations into preferred situations

65
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.650 
and what a
transition design

66
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.300 
ultimately aims for is changing existing
situations into preferred futures

67
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.840 
Now those futures, there is
not going to be one future

68
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.810 
but in order to be able to create
multiple futures, you have

69
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.180 
to be able to
innovate system

70
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.160 
and if we take an example,
the system of education

71
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.510 
and we could talk about the system
of healthcare, for example

72
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.160 
We could talk about the political
systems but let's take an easy one

73
00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:00.570 
the system of education, so,
most innovators are going to

74
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.100 
be working within
organizations and primarily

75
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.540 
organizations that are providing products
and services to the education market

76
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.280 
Though they're going to be looking
to innovate or to have a new value

77
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.820 
proposition, a new offering
within the current business or

78
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.970 
industry that
they're working

79
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:28.820 
so, in this case, education and transition
design as it's been formulated by Terry Irwin

80
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.430 
and a few others at Carnegie Mellon,
they would be looking down

81
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.260 
at the products and
services of education but

82
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.560 
how do we change the
system of education?

83
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.200 
By system, it's much
more complex than

84
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.890 
e-learning module
or a gaming app

85
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.470 
I mean this sounds logical
but the practical question

86
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.020 
that I would now ask you Joseph
is what do you see or who

87
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.690 
do you see is then, basically,
one who is responsible for

88
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.610 
it or how do you educate an
entire group of people

89
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.730 
to design a system because
it cannot be done by

90
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.670 
just a single person, right, or an
entity? I mean, sometimes you have

91
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.130 
entities which are so influential like
Apple, they might change ecosystems

92
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.580 
or they did in the past but in
general, I think it needs to

93
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.900 
be a phenomenon of groups, right?
So, what is your take on that?

94
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.820 
Yes, so, I think that touches
on a debate that you and I

95
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.670 
had over the years. Yes. But
before I get to the debate, I'll

96
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.020 
just address that question
from the point of view

97
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.600 
that tradition design as an
emerging discipline proposes

98
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.740 
Transition design argues
that a designer

99
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:07.600 
has the ability to be able to bring
together the right players in that system

100
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:18.420 
Ok, so it's not at all about the designer
in the stereotypical traditional role

101
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:24.100 
of experts and I always refer
back to the stereotypical

102
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.090 
traditional role
of the architect

103
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:32.430 
Now you saw the "starchitect". You can
take Frank Gehry and many others

104
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:39.010 
they are the ones that are the
driving force behind a creative

105
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:46.280 
design which is represented in physical
form and so what transition design argued

106
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.920 
that a designer because they are
human-centered because they

107
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.200 
are able to visualize

108
00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:01.620 
and most importantly and this again
is my bias as a trained architect

109
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.220 
we are actually taught
to think systemically

110
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.340 
By systemically, from the point
of view of architecture we

111
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.810 
are always going to be
looking at the site

112
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.110 
so, where a design is happening,
we will always be looking at use

113
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.590 
We will always be
looking at materials

114
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.850 
always be looking at the social
structures that edifice

115
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.130 
finds itself within, you think about
architectural re-use, for example,

116
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.670 
how do you take buildings that played
a role in society that has changed?

117
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.220 
How do you adopt that? And you
can also look at urban design

118
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:50.240 
as another wonderful example of training
designers to be truly systemic thinkers

119
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.690 
You're absolutely right that changing
system needs to bring people together

120
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.550 
and everyone who is involved with that
has to bring their expertise but

121
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.580 
that art of, I would use
the word, leadership

122
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.700 
in the sense of bringing people
together for collective action

123
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.870 
that ultimately is what a
designer does and again

124
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.670 
put aside the "starchitect", any
architect that is working in any

125
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.520 
physical environment has to
bring many people together and

126
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:33.550 
be able to negotiate in a design dialogue
to be able to create a physical artifact

127
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.990 
that represents their
collective view of and

128
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.240 
calling innovation - a
better future, a change

129
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.780 
Now the debate that you
and I always have is

130
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.990 
where those ideas come from?
And I still firmly believe

131
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.550 
and even transition design, Tara and I
have had a number of conversations

132
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:09.120 
that a designer is uniquely capable of
being able to envision a preferred future

133
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.220 
Now, the challenge of a designer
is that they may fall

134
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.910 
in love with that preferred
future. Yes. And building up a

135
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.170 
very significant cognitive bias
which is called the IKEA effect

136
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:30.900 
that hinders their ability to perform
that design is a social act

137
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.890 
to bring people together and
converge on a preferred future

138
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:43.710 
which as we know will evolve as
that design a social dialogue

139
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:49.040 
around the physical object of all
throughout those interactions

140
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.440 
And, I mean, how
is that, so,

141
00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:02.430 
how can someone imagine a
future? I mean, if I look from

142
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.870 
a practitioner's point of view into
organizations. I see a lot of

143
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.830 
of people struggling to imagine
even tomorrow, right? So,

144
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.940 
because of the concept change, because of
the brutality of markets and situation so,

145
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.680 
everything is in blur
at the moment but

146
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:25.310 
but how do you then enable people
or can you even train people to

147
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.920 
be able to see something that
is maybe happening in 3, 4,

148
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:34.320 
5 or even in 10 years from now and
not on just the product level

149
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.980 
that you have set but even on a more
complex level, the systemic level

150
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.340 
so, I mean

151
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:51.540 
how is that possible? So, let's take
a concrete example. You asked

152
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.970 
about my shirt earlier

153
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.480 
and so, Ridley Scott wrote
and directed Alien in 1979

154
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:07.440 
and it was a fundamental
breakthrough in film noir in space

155
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:14.340 
and a monster movie that had
never been conceived of before

156
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.060 
it's unlike Star Wars because you
could argue that George Lucas

157
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.190 
had a number of
inspirations

158
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.640 
for Star Wars - Akira Kurosawa, Joseph Campbell, Myth (The
Power of Myth) and The Hero (The Hero with a Thousand Faces)

159
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.360 
but I firmly believe that Ridley
Scott is one of those visionaries

160
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.330 
and you look at the worlds that he's
been able to create over the years and

161
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.650 
think about Blade Runner and you can
think about Gladiator and obviously

162
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:50.900 
he's had a couple of, you know, misses but I
firmly believe that Ridley Scott's training

163
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:58.090 
at the Royal College of Arts and his
ability, I'm sorry, his capability

164
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.980 
to be able to sketch
those visions

165
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.570 
in storyboards, if you go online, you can
actually see Ridley Scott's sketches

166
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.870 
of storyboard for all of
his work and you can look

167
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.810 
at another great example, that is I'm
talking about Star Wars, Syd Mead

168
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:25.210 
So, Syd Mead took George Lucas's
script and began the storyboards

169
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:31.260 
and that's what gave rise to the
famous costume of Darth Vader,

170
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:38.900 
concept of lightsabers, you can look
at some of the storyboards from

171
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.450 
from Episode number 5 (The
Empire Strikes Back)

172
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.590 
The Return of the Jedi, no, episode
number 5 is The Empire Strikes Back

173
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.280 
fabulous sketches of
Sky City (Cloud City)

174
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.910 
so I guess my point is that I
still believe and again this

175
00:14:54.910 --> 00:15:02.320 
is my bias, as you know, that being
trained to visually express

176
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.600 
your imagination is a very
important capability and it

177
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.410 
is something that takes practice, takes
a lot of time, now having said that

178
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:17.470 
what I'm very excited about the work
that I have been doing at the

179
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.240 
Institute for the Future
is learning about

180
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.040 
two very important elements to be
able to create those futures

181
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.410 
and by the way, adding to the
future there are a number of

182
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.650 
science fiction writers
and journalists

183
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:40.710 
so, they also have a craft to visualize
their visions of what the future could be

184
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.160 
and at the Institute for the Future,
they compliment that craft

185
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.020 
with two things -
number 1: signals

186
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:58.200 
so, being able to observe whether some of
the emerging technologies, practices

187
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:04.330 
start-ups, behavioral changes
that could be harbingers,

188
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:10.610 
indicators of what the future could bring
so that's a really important signal

189
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:18.480 
The dangers and predictors also to
imagine different variations of futures

190
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:23.370 
Yeah, and that goes into the
whole discipline foresight

191
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:32.520 
Yes, those signals are used as input for
future thinkers are foresight practitioners

192
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.260 
to be able to have foresight,
it creates plausible

193
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:44.080 
and preferred scenarios of the future. Now,
I'll add one more important ingredient

194
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.720 
and that is what I think is also wonderful
about the work of transition design

195
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:57.140 
is that they will conduct a
very rigorous analysis of

196
00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.080 
not just the near past

197
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.860 
to gain understanding of some of the
challenges that are happening today

198
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.660 
but also the very historic past,
for example, there's a wonderful

199
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:16.050 
analysis that the CMU (Carnegie Mellon
University) team has done on COVID-19

200
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:23.440 
going back 200, 300, 400
years in the United States

201
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.640 
about identifying acts,
obviously, slavery

202
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.210 
identifying acts,
suffrage movement

203
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:39.920 
voting, seditions about health care,
and it's an incredible analysis

204
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.040 
which gives a transition designer
or foresight practitioner

205
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.750 
again, a lot of raw elements that in
combination with what's happening today

206
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.670 
and at the
creative ability

207
00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:01.050 
those are all very important
ingredients in being able to empower

208
00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:06.090 
someone to be able to envision that
plausible and preferred future

209
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.140 
which then can become
the north star

210
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:17.270 
to bring others around and then
begin in that design dialogue

211
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:23.520 
towards that north star which will
continue to evolve as people

212
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.920 
do as Roberto refers
to clash and fuse

213
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:34.180 
and eventually converged on shaping
the meaning for that plausible

214
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:40.650 
future. Joseph, just putting
myself again back into this

215
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.870 
position of someone working
in an organization of today

216
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:53.250 
sometimes I see already new rules are popping
up with the description of futurist

217
00:18:53.390 --> 00:19:00.090 
or future thinker is that
what they used to do are

218
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.610 
basically to think about
these desirable futures

219
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:09.720 
and systematic aspect or do you think
it needs to be much broader than

220
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.220 
having one person
assigned to that role?

221
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:21.160 
Yeah, it's interesting that you mention it
because that is a very important signal

222
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:27.090 
or what my colleague at the
Institution for the Future referring

223
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:32.560 
to is the risk that future thinking
will become the next design thinking

224
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.770 
in the sense that

225
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:41.010 
individuals who have learned
about the method, they've taken

226
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.870 
a course, done
a workshop

227
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:48.970 
they could instantly switch and
become design thinkers and

228
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.490 
we're starting to see that in
organizations as you just pointed out

229
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.480 
that by taking a course and there
are a lot of good courses online

230
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.690 
IFTF (Institute for the Future) offers very good
courses, there are other organizations as well

231
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.490 
I think the risk is that again
we miss the depth of expertise

232
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.160 
it is a profession beyond that I'm
just learning about the profession

233
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.010 
and the fact that I didn't know that
it's a 58-year-old discipline

234
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.040 
going back to
Jules Verne

235
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.930 
and others that have been able to
conduct really deep research

236
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.810 
and use rigorous methods to be able
to create those plausible preferred

237
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:37.980 
futures. Now, I think within, if we look
at the example of design thinking

238
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:44.190 
on the positive side, it's had
an incredible impact on the

239
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:50.800 
culture, capabilities, the language,
I mean you remember it was

240
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.080 
like 10 years ago and if I walked
into meaning with this t-shirt

241
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.450 
I probably would have
been thrown out

242
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.840 
You know my story, 20 years
ago I joined Deloitte

243
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.030 
I removed the word
architecture from my CV

244
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.530 
Design Thinking has been incredible
in bringing the world of business

245
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.730 
and creativity much much closer
together and given a whole

246
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.750 
new vocabulary which enables us to do the
work that they were passionate about doing

247
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.060 
I do think that's very positive
and what we've also seen is

248
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.320 
that the reason that that's happened
is because of the democratization

249
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.120 
of design thinking

250
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:39.590 
So, for future thinking, I think
that there is a need to be

251
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.450 
able to democratize that and that's also why
join IFTF (Institute for the Future) because

252
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.710 
that is part of
their mission

253
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:53.140 
and that is important to be able
to have the ability to conduct

254
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.790 
these kinds of
conversations,

255
00:21:55.610 --> 00:22:02.710 
about signals, about the future, about
the past but I still believe like

256
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:09.660 
in design, it is important to have that
real understanding of the discipline

257
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.630 
same goes with futures

258
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.560 
I mean with design thinking, I think
there was never a big debate

259
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.750 
on what level you need to have that
kind of mindset, so, it was always

260
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.780 
undisputed that across all
hierarchies you should

261
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.840 
have a fair amount of knowledge
and also culture going on to

262
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.190 
act to use it successfully
for an organization

263
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.410 
When it comes to the future aspect,
how do you see that? Is it

264
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.050 
then more on the top
management required to

265
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.540 
think about the desired futures
or we need to have this on more

266
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.640 
operational level implemented to
like like design-thinking is

267
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.660 
going to happen like that at the
moment? Right, yeah, I think

268
00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.480 
it's very similar, the analogy is quite
similar so if you look at design thinking

269
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.170 
you know, you and myself
and others have run ExCo

270
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.910 
sessions, where we're not spending
time getting into doing empathy maps

271
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:19.470 
or daily life scenario but
it's much more what we call

272
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.590 
at a person's new school we're
still teaching strategic design

273
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.680 
and strategic design is looking
more systemically obviously

274
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.580 
an ExCo member is going to be
interested in what are the

275
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.650 
social impacts of new technology or the
current economic impact of the technology?

276
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.610 
They should be interested in
the environmental impacts

277
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:45.910 
today, as well. So, there's that
level of strategic design and

278
00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.590 
then as you go further down there
are going to be more concrete

279
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.020 
applications of the methodology. Future
thinking, I think is quite similar

280
00:23:55.150 --> 00:24:02.820 
in that regard plus there is still the
need to have professionals, to have

281
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:11.040 
a real strong practical and
theoretical experience

282
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.820 
to compliment those leaders and
organizations who are ultimately

283
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.460 
responsible for the transformation.
Now the challenge is

284
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:28.790 
in organizations, if the leaders
themselves have not co-created

285
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.640 
and had a significant
hand in crafting

286
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.670 
that preferred future

287
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.590 
over that new
product or service

288
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:43.150 
we have shown in our research
and work in organizations that

289
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.900 
they will be
less willing

290
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:51.830 
to make the changes in their organizations
that are required to realize

291
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.170 
that preferred future

292
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.000 
and that goes back
to the IKEA effect

293
00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.170 
If I'm not creating that
piece of furniture

294
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.940 
then I'm gonna have very little connection
with it. I still remember the

295
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.940 
double bed that I built for my
kids when they were younger

296
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.920 
that was a fundamental
experience and that's what

297
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:23.560 
IKEA was able to tap into the human need
to create, they made it very easy

298
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:29.160 
but it taps into that need because I
feel much more ownership commitment

299
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.660 
to my bed and that's exactly the
work that Dan Ariely and others

300
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.490 
researched in identifying this
cognitive bias called the IKEA effect

301
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.390 
and designers use that and leaders
need to be doing that more

302
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.680 
The challenge is that many
of them will outsource

303
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:54.400 
that work to consultants or the
professionals and then when that new

304
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.750 
shiny object comes back and could
be a strategic report, it

305
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.890 
could be a business model
or an actual prototype

306
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.740 
Don't look at it with distance
because they don't have that

307
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:14.070 
experience to co-create and build
emotion into the object. Emotion

308
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.280 
and meaning
obviously as well

309
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.950 
I mean by reflecting on what you
say I'm missing two words so far

310
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:28.660 
and maybe you did it intentionally or
maybe not or maybe intentionally

311
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.620 
it's vision
and strategy

312
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:44.160 
So, is there a bridge between what you
call system thinking or transitional

313
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.740 
transition design of futures
and then linking it back

314
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.860 
to the leadership team to provide
them with a vision and strategy or

315
00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:05.080 
different and if yes, in what regard?
Right, very interesting question

316
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.790 
So, I unintentionally

317
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.750 
intentionally avoid
using those words

318
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:22.490 
and I will explain why? Because of my
years at consulting, those buzzwords

319
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:29.180 
had so much confusion that I
intentionally avoid them

320
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:35.710 
Now, I unintentionally avoided those
words in this conversation because

321
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.170 
we are talking about the role
of design and innovation

322
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:47.620 
and the role of design and innovation
at its core is all about

323
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.770 
an object. Ok? The object
of design activity

324
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.960 
and we can call that
object whatever we want

325
00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.900 
Want to call it a vision, wonderful. You want to call it a
strategy, fine. You want to call it a business plan, wonderful

326
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.540 
you want to call
it a prototype

327
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.930 
as designers the real role that we can
play in innovation it is the focus

328
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:20.320 
others on co-creating an object.
Now, the label that object will

329
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:27.110 
depend on what that collective
needs? Where they currently are

330
00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:32.020 
and what is the label that will most
resonate and bring them together?

331
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.610 
So, in some organizations, leadership
will come and say we need a vision

332
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:43.270 
and then I would recommend that
practitioners in that space with say

333
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:50.390 
"Ok, let's create a vision." What are the
actual design elements in their vision?

334
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.970 
I always go back because of
my training as an architect

335
00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.990 
I always go back
to the thing

336
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:07.160 
This and this, this, then I
always go back to the thing

337
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.460 
just like that IKEA double
bed that I mentioned

338
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.070 
As designers, we're craftsmen.
Craftsmen and crafts people

339
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:21.300 
and we're always going to be
looking at how can we create

340
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.350 
literally create something that's also
I don't use the word "creativity"

341
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.340 
I always use the word what are we
"creating"? What are the elements of that?

342
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:34.260 
What are the materials that go into
that? So, you know, an inner vision

343
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.870 
You may say, one of the elements
that are going to go into it

344
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.040 
is a market analysis

345
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:44.770 
You may say, for a strategy, one of the
elements that are going to go into it is

346
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.090 
now the business
targets

347
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:52.650 
Those are all the raw materials
that a designer uses to

348
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:59.480 
co-create that thing and nurturing
that thing and navigating through

349
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.090 
the complexities of the collective.
That's really the art of design

350
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.700 
in organizations. It's
less about a method

351
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:14.600 
but it's much more about a
mindset, a skill set, capability

352
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:22.680 
which frankly takes years to develop, just as,
I'll go back to my example, the architect

353
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.730 
and the architect goes through in
the US until they're certified

354
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.020 
and have a professional
license (10 years)

355
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.620 
and that includes academic
education and practical

356
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.810 
actual work experience and
they have to take an exam

357
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:45.220 
and I still believe that you
need to have those experiences

358
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.750 
to be able to practice
the art and craft

359
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:56.200 
and a little bit of magic as well in
chaperoning those designed objects

360
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.050 
in organizations
cause then

361
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:05.740 
we know how complicated it is. It ain't
easy, it ain't easy. it takes time,

362
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:11.430 
sensitivity, awareness and remember we
always talked about the design squiggle

363
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.180 
and the design squiggle, yes it
does represent the evolution

364
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.780 
of that design object

365
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.730 
and also more importantly represents
a convergence of shared meaning

366
00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.280 
through a number of stakeholders and if
we began in an organization with over a

367
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.970 
10 stakeholders, yeah, your squiggle
is going to look a lot like that

368
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.290 
because everyone can provide your
ability as a designer to chaperone

369
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:47.580 
the sheared meaning, brood the
design object will ultimately get

370
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:53.960 
you to converge through that
process to the shared meaning.

371
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.600 
Exactly, but it happens
through the object

372
00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:03.270 
Never forget that. So, Joseph, we
talk a lot about the process

373
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.350 
the structure, the systemic thinking
and that just got me thinking

374
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.050 
as you know that doing design
can be messy from time to time

375
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.030 
and we talk a lot about how
to deal with ambiguity,

376
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.190 
how to learn, how to navigate in
a fuzzy part of the process

377
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.770 
What is the connection? What is
the relationship between the

378
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.730 
systemic thinking and learning
how to deal with ambiguity?

379
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:40.800 
Yeah, that's really
the trick and

380
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:48.350 
as someone who has trained others in
design and also trained others in

381
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:54.410 
ambiguity, resilience,
creativity as well

382
00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:01.160 
I've kind of come to the point
where I think the only way to

383
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:11.570 
be able to maintain resilience
in a very complex system

384
00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:15.680 
that is going to continue to evolve
and those ups and downs are

385
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.960 
good indicators of the evolution
assuming that it's moving in

386
00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.460 
a direction of a
preferred future

387
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:28.200 
Yeah, this may be something that you don't
want to include but I personally think

388
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:36.120 
the practitioner in that environment has
to have a very high level of presence,

389
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:42.550 
a very high level presence, a very
high level of self-awareness

390
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:52.710 
to be able to navigate those ups and
downs, to be able to take the clash

391
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.040 
that will come

392
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:01.980 
artistically fuse ideas on
the road to convergence

393
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.510 
I'm convinced, you know, certainly
over the last couple of years of

394
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:13.370 
the role of presence, awareness and I'll
add in the "s" word, spirituality

395
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.180 
Now, these are
also a bit

396
00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.450 
in the buzz word space

397
00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:26.630 
but I really do believe there's
a reason why architects

398
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.020 
really only make
significant

399
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.390 
impact or ability to express
their creative visions

400
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.260 
when they are
much much older

401
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.580 
and I believe, I have done research
on this but I believe that

402
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:49.310 
when they are younger, they will, some
of them succeed but the majority don't

403
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:55.200 
because they are too attached to their
ideas, too attached to that future

404
00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.650 
but as you grow older and you
gain that level of presence and

405
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.940 
understanding of others

406
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.950 
you're smarter about the ability,
about the waves to navigate

407
00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.330 
through to that point and so,
again this may not be part

408
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:20.720 
of the course but I'm more and more convinced
that spirituality, awareness, presence

409
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:27.170 
that is the fundamental base,
the gift, people like

410
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:32.290 
ourselves, the ability to go into those
very complex situations and co-create

411
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.620 
objects that will help

412
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.550 
achieve our objective of mobilizing
others for collective action

413
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.860 
The change existing situations
into preferred futures

414
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.550 
But that's interesting
so the older we get

415
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.370 
the higher the likelihood
that we have self-awareness

416
00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.110 
that we have this reflection but
at the same time you mentioned

417
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:02.800 
that the importance of
expressing your imagination

418
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.470 
and there are some studies
that say that children, for

419
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.590 
example, they have a higher
imagination than adults

420
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.630 
for example, because they take different risks,
they feel things from a different perspective

421
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:23.180 
So, how do we balance it? Because does that
mean that the younger you are, the more

422
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:29.490 
imagination you have and the older you
are, the more self-aware you are

423
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:34.810 
So, how is it working?
It's a wonderful

424
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.690 
wonderful paradox and as you
were describing Danielly, what

425
00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.360 
came to my mind was two

426
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.590 
polarities. So, if you have
creativity on one side and you have

427
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.860 
presence and awareness
on the other side

428
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:59.520 
and your example of the child is very good
because they are going to be over here

429
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.220 
on the creativity but then they are not
going to add any sense of self-awareness

430
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.790 
So, they're so short, development
is obviously going to be

431
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.450 
quite low. So, we can certainly
admire them for their creativity

432
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:17.220 
but we also need to be aware that
they lack those that self awareness

433
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:24.520 
which is known for social skills,
right? That's self-awareness

434
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.330 
and then if you look at
people as they get older

435
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.470 
yes, they might have all that self-awareness
but they completely lost the creativity

436
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:40.170 
because of the educational system
that we have, because of

437
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:46.350 
I'll say, the limitations of parents even
though they may have good intentions

438
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.540 
and this is a really interesting
dichotomy because everyone

439
00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.880 
says you need to have
creativity as a skill today

440
00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.930 
but most of our educational
institutions are still funneling

441
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:07.360 
kids into the traditional Maths-Science
tracks which which are important

442
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.820 
but then they funnel them through it
in very traditional standard testing

443
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.730 
which is not a measure of
creativity. Measure is logic

444
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.030 
I think there's a systemic issue
that needs to be addressed

445
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:24.600 
to be able to balance those two
and that's why I do believe that

446
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:31.410 
kids who have gone through
any artistic education at

447
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:36.480 
the high school level and they continue it at the
university level, again, there is no guarantee

448
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.960 
but there is a high likelihood
that they'll have both

449
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:44.260 
Similarly, I mean let's be
honest not every old man

450
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.450 
or woman has that level of
self-awareness presence

451
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:56.040 
but if they are aware of that and they
are practicing and I'm talking about

452
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.050 
practicing mindfulness,
meditation

453
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:05.510 
being aware of emotional
intelligence, these are disciplines

454
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:10.870 
that can't be learned on a weekend,
they are things that need

455
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.800 
to be practiced on
a daily basis

456
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:18.000 
and if you're able to do those then I
think there's a higher likelihood

457
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:22.700 
of arriving at that place. Now, there are many
many exceptions and I certainly wouldn't

458
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:31.010 
imply that only as you
age, you grow in wisdom

459
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.250 
and there are plenty of examples it's
not the case. There are plenty of

460
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.350 
your generation, for example,
Danielly, that have that

461
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.330 
presence, they have that awareness
and they have that desire

462
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.490 
to make a difference and they've taken
the time to go to Mongolia and

463
00:39:51.650 --> 00:40:00.030 
built natural irrigation forms or making an
impact in communities in sub-Saharan Africa

464
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:05.460 
So, today there are a lot more
opportunities to accelerate arriving

465
00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:12.700 
at that place which blends that
creative vision and passion with

466
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:19.630 
that sense of presence and self-awareness
and ultimately it comes down to

467
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.530 
an individual's
search for meaning

468
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.200 
and if you look at
Frankl's work

469
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.400 
and other humanists, the search for
meaning is what drives human beings

470
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:41.050 
towards more self-fulfillment and self-fulfillment
comes through self-actualization

471
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:46.250 
and designing is a
very powerful way to

472
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:52.290 
gain that self-actualization
through the

473
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:59.100 
godlike experience of creating
something even if it's something

474
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.740 
as simple as this or a t-shirt and
that's why I think, you know

475
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.990 
some elements that are
also very important

476
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.420 
from the discipline
of design

477
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:16.200 
that could be brought into the conversation
about how do you innovate within organizations

478
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.570 
which is really the
fundamental challenge that

479
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.430 
all of us in the professional
environment face

480
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:28.850 
So, from what i could understand that
two important elements of having the

481
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:34.150 
mind of designing the future is
the capacity to express your

482
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:38.710 
imagination through your creativity
and also your ability to

483
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.450 
be self-aware to reflect on
yourself on the actions on what's

484
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:47.360 
happening on those surrounding.
So, my question to you and I

485
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.460 
believe this is our last question we are
approaching the end of our conversation

486
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:56.540 
So, my question to you with what
would be your advice to companies

487
00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.530 
to foster these environments where
they can encourage the employees

488
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:11.370 
to improve their capabilities
in these two elements?

489
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.650 
Yeah, I'm going to
be honest, I have

490
00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:20.250 
have a utopian view and
have a dystopian view

491
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.480 
to that question, I'll start
with a dystopian view

492
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.610 
I'm frankly not convinced
that it's possible

493
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.660 
because of the systems
that have been created

494
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.950 
to sustain
organizations

495
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.740 
it's very simple and I think
I've certainly spent

496
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.380 
20 years of my
consulting career

497
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.840 
in the trenches of
those organizations

498
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:55.320 
because of the infrastructure
created to keep those systems

499
00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:03.920 
viable, I am not convinced and talking about
infrastructure, processes of technology

500
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:11.180 
which obviously had an influence on culture,
you throw in metrics and incentives as well

501
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:16.080 
I have that dystopian view that
there's nothing they can do

502
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.530 
I have a utopian view just because
I like to think of myself

503
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.720 
as a hopeful
human being

504
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:28.140 
and maybe this might be a better
response to your question

505
00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.350 
I really think there are
3 critical elements

506
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:38.560 
Number 1 starts with that
search for meaning

507
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:45.540 
and leadership at all levels that are
interested in searching for meaning

508
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:49.270 
both organizationally

509
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.610 
but also personally there's
a better likelihood

510
00:43:54.790 --> 00:44:01.100 
I think the second element is
that they have to also take the

511
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.330 
time to truly develop
those capabilities

512
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.570 
which will strengthen

513
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:17.220 
the muscle memory and that means
things like I am writing creative or

514
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.550 
drawing a modern building
and today there is plenty

515
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.010 
of other technologies available
to be able to help that but

516
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.300 
I really believe that taking the time
to develop those capabilities require

517
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:34.650 
rigorous work, Ok? It's not
a weeklong discussion

518
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:39.250 
I think if you have the mindset
for searching for meaning you

519
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.070 
have the capabilities
some mind and hand

520
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:46.790 
then ideally there should be a place
where you've got the stomach

521
00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.740 
and the soul if you will to make
some of those hard decisions

522
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:56.290 
So, as an example, rather than
having an own p-process

523
00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.270 
on an annual basis may be that
own p-process has to be

524
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.790 
more like China or
Russia five years

525
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:10.950 
and that we actually give more
runway for people who have that

526
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:14.440 
desire to search for meaning and
the capabilities to actually

527
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.990 
envision those preferred futures,
to be able to actually

528
00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.850 
take the time to make those changes
and that means that shareholders

529
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:32.380 
would have to change their metrics
from the great signal the GEP

530
00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.560 
So, you have the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) that's the typical metric of

531
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.460 
most modern nations

532
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:46.930 
GEP is the Gross Environmental
Product and there is a city

533
00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:52.240 
in India that is now tracking GEP and
that means they're actually measuring

534
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.850 
the impact on their productivity
on the environment

535
00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:00.630 
Ideally, that will
also be incentivized

536
00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:06.530 
So, you've gotta have the stomach
for this but that means that

537
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.300 
you've also got to be willing to
make some of those fundamental

538
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:13.570 
changes to be able to
imagine a preferred future

539
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:19.690 
to be able to design it in a
meaningful co-created way and

540
00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:23.740 
ultimately it comes down to your
ability to lead the transformation

541
00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.150 
and that's both of
you are aware of

542
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:31.820 
research we've been doing is on
innovation design and leadership ideals

543
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.430 
and we think those three
elements integrated

544
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.840 
portent more potential for
transformative innovation happen

545
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.350 
within organizations

546
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:50.130 
So, let's maybe round it up. Today
we spoke with Dr. Joseph Press

547
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:55.450 
He has a Ph.D. from MIT in
Architecture, has been

548
00:46:55.450 --> 00:47:01.120 
a long extended work period with
Deloitte in leadership cultural

549
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.250 
transformation and it gets many
other topics and then later

550
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:09.860 
he joined the center for creative
leadership and has been involved

551
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:15.380 
in numerous e-MBA programs around the
world with leading universities

552
00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:21.900 
like Politecnico di Milano, University of St.
Gallen but also Parsons School of Design

553
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:29.240 
and yeah you did
successfully

554
00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:33.490 
a lot of projects with large
corporates. So, thank you, Joseph

555
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:39.300 
for spending time with
us. It's always good

556
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:45.180 
to have you around and hopefully
see you soon again in a

557
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.390 
physical space as soon as the
pandemic is over. Hopefully

558
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.460 
Thank you for the opportunity,
it's always wonderful

559
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.160 
to have these conversations
and let's continue to

560
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.110 
paint our existing situations
into preferred futures

561
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.580 
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Joseph

562
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:11.148 
and thank you to our listeners. We'll see you again
as part of a night speaker series. Thank you!

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.900 
In our online course "Half Century
of Internet: How it Works Today"

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.240 
we start with having a first look
to the internet. And if we

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.900 
look to the internet we realize that
the internet is a net of networks.

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.350 
So it's not a uniform network technology
is a network of very different networks

5
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.850 
around the world. I showed this
image already in the other click.

6
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.450 
There are various smart devices in
use and smart devices are devices

7
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.500 
that are able to
use the internet.

8
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.490 
So this is the explanation of
the virtual world. Of course

9
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.430 
the computers. Computers can be
connected to the internet can

10
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.430 
be used computers, the laptops
and tablets, it can connect to

11
00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.890 
the internet also smartphones, it can
connect to the internet and nowadays also

12
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.030 
he devices and sings like
lamps or heating or others.

13
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.810 
Here a TV

14
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.400 
is

15
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
certainly connected to the internet. The
sockets uh which are necessary to control

16
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.190 
games, entertainments and smart
home activities and others.

17
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.370 
The gaming controls all
are such smart devices

18
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.340 
that can be made use of the internet and
also a toothbrushes, coffee machines -

19
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.310 
they can be connected to the internet.
If we look if you look in your home

20
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.900 
your home network then typically it is
a local area network. It's a network

21
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.350 
in your flat, in your house, a
local area network in most cases

22
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.510 
there is a router with a modem
which connects your network

23
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.500 
with an internet service provider
and this internet service provider

24
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.440 
helps to connect your network to
the network of other people

25
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.040 
to the network of institutions
around the world and in this way

26
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.260 
the internet is formed as
a network of networks.

27
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.800 
How does this connection for example
in your home to the internet

28
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.390 
how it is organised? Typically see a
connection is done via a telephone line.

29
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.730 
Via the telephone line and by the help
of an internet service provider

30
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.070 
internet service provider and
it looks as follows: here you

31
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.480 
have your telephone socket
or your cable connection,

32
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.130 
then there is the house connection
and then there is a telephone line

33
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.630 
which connects your home
with a dial-up modem

34
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.160 
on the side of an internet service
provider. The internet service provider

35
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.000 
has regional data centres
and over this connection

36
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.650 
over the transformation
of the

37
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.500 
types different types of information
to a string of a bit string of

38
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.440 
string of zeros and ones here in this
way the internet service provider

39
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.440 
zeros and ones. Here in this way
the internet service provider

40
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.420 
connects your home
with other networks,

41
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.260 
with the world wide internet. Here are
many such internet service providers

42
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.920 
which are connected with each
other, which you connect to this

43
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.020 
internet service
provider and then you

44
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.900 
can connect via the internet service provider
with other peoples around the world.

45
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.050 
If we look a little bit closer
to the internet here is a tiny

46
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.250 
except. We have the internet service
providers, these are the red ones,

47
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.240 
and around the internet service
providers are different customers

48
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.750 
for example here is our home network,
here is another home network

49
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.650 
and they have said different
customers which are connected

50
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.750 
to the internet service provider and
then the internet service provider

51
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.800 
are interconnected by each
other, typically by backbone

52
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.890 
by backbone connections which are very
powerful. So that means there is a

53
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.290 
broad bandwidth so that a lot of
information can be exchanged

54
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.490 
between the internet service provider and
in this way a customer here on that

55
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.210 
side of the world can be connected
over this interconnected networks

56
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.140 
to a customer on the other
side of the world. There can

57
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.900 
be dedicated lines in the connection
to the internet service

58
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.860 
provider but it can also be such
dial-up connection just mentioned.

59
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.390 
If we look for example one nation
here is and it's a German wide

60
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.170 
internet, is the infrastructure with
different internet service provider

61
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.710 
with different nodes, it's not
necessary to go into the detail.

62
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.010 
I want to impress you with this
very strong interconnection

63
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.460 
of all the people of all the
devices around the world. Here

64
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.970 
is a global internet infrastructure,
the colors show how a strong

65
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.630 
it is used, what a part of the
population is online is connected

66
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.140 
and you see here very active and
connected. China is an example.

67
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.240 
So the internet is a network of
networks very different technologies

68
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.170 
which are interconnected with each other
to form the worldwide computer networks.

69
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.690 
Though there is not a uniform
network that is an interconnection

70
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.350 
of networks, that the reason
also for this term "inter"

71
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.670 
the network. So and what we learn
in the course is that there

72
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:39.840 
is no network technology which
helps to let this internet

73
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.810 
provides impression of a virtual
network, since our software which

74
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:53.240 
is helping us to get this network, this
network character forces in the networking.

75
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.910 
The data are transported in
the single networks which

76
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.950 
are interconnected to the internet.
They have different technologies and

77
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:12.010 
over this different connected
networks, a world is created

78
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.680 
by means of the internet protocols
which give us the users impression

79
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:24.500 
that this interconnected, this network
of networks form a uniform network.

80
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.070 
The technology that is used and
that was invented fifty years ago

81
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.480 
this is called
internetworking.

82
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:42.050 
So it let appear this network of
networks as a uniform network.

83
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.820 
So when we speak about internet
technology, then it's exactly that

84
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.620 
protocols, thatstandards, that
techniques that are used

85
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.720 
to let this interconnection
of networks

86
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:04.340 
have the character of uniform
networks. So the communication

87
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:10.390 
protocols, the software this provides is
impression he is a very essential part

88
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.940 
providing or forming
the virtual network.

89
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.810 
In our course we will have closer looks
to the different internet protocols

90
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.380 
that are in place and which are
needed to control the data exchange

91
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.990 
and the most
difficult part is

92
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:37.180 
to control the data exchange across the
boundaries of a different physical networks.

93
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:45.050 
On the place where they are interconnected,
there we need internet protocols

94
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.800 
to provide this
network character.

95
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.290 
Interesting case this internet
protocols, it is in the internet

96
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.690 
itself, it is an open
system architecture.

97
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:03.850 
So everyone can understand, everyone
can see how it works, all

98
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:11.040 
these standards, all the regulations are
published in the internet so everyone

99
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:16.020 
who wants to create an own service,
who wants to make use of this

100
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.400 
internet, who wants to a
develop a new technique

101
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.400 
can use this thing.

102
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.190 
So when we what we want to do
in our course or we need

103
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.030 
a little time to elaborate this in
detail is we look to the internet

104
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.690 
as a world wide connection of
different computer networks and

105
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:46.250 
we see how this interconnected
networks create a virtual network.

106
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.720 
This will a be our point which we
consider in the second week.

107
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.040 
So with this
technique the

108
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.480 
interconnection of the networks
appears as a unified network

109
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:06.480 
and the technology that is used is
the internet working technologies.

110
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.930 
We have a closer look to
this in the third week.

111
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.130 
And then an essential part in this
internet working technology

112
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.030 
are the communication
protocols,

113
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.830 
IP protocols, TCP protocol, UDP protocol,
many of the application protocols

114
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:30.040 
and these protocols we will discuss
in week three and week four.

115
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.970 
In the week five and week six
then we will speak about

116
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.700 
the various applications in the internet.
Of course the internet was created

117
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.680 
to provide services, to provide
application to the user and

118
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:52.610 
essentially for all kinds of application
is security. So in sixth week

119
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.980 
in week six of our course we
speak about internet security.

120
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.100 
So it's an interesting
programme.

121
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:07.330 
I hope you will join us on this
journey to understand how internet,

122
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.590 
the network of
networks is working.

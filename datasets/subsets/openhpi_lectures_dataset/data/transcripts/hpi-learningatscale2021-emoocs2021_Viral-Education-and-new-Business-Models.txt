00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 
Hi, good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.780 
I hope everybody is

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.720 
doing all right and enjoying

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.420 
this virtual gathering from all the various places; around

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.460 
Europe and the world. I see some familiar faces

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.630 
and some people that I don't yet know.

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.990 
It is very different

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.550 
than being in person.

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.250 
Although, the biggest fan of digital and online education,

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.270 
I personally do miss the kind of physical aspects, the

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.130 
human interaction, the four dimensions.

12
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.160 
But I think we have a great

13
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.910 
set of people here today to talk to

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.410 
you and with you about a topic that I think is really interesting and that is

15
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.030 
really the future of skills education and what we are

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.910 
doing as a university to

17
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.730 
look at the future workforce. So,

18
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.810 
let me introduce our panel that is crossing the global. We have

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.770 
Dan Vigdor from HackerU on my left-hand side

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.130 
all the way from Miami.

21
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.980 
And Mark Lester on my right-hand side actually

22
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.650 
from London. I absolutely love your new apartment Mark.

23
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.210 
It is aspirational.

24
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.850 
And Mark is with a company called FourthRev.

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.500 
what I'll do if that's okay with everyone, we have the chat just to feel

26
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.640 
free to post any questions, or raise your hand,

27
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.680 
to get the floor if you want to have questions. But the

28
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.590 
format of today I suggest is the following; I'll introduce our distinguished speakers,

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.020 
after that I'll hand them the floor to give a short rundown

30
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.530 
on what they do and how they

31
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.250 
work and after that I'll ask some questions and open

32
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.100 
it up to the floor. So

33
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.100 
without further ado, first Mark Lester and

34
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.260 
I hope you'll blush a bit.

35
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.680 
Marc has been at the FourthRev of education innovation.

36
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.310 
He was part of the founding team at future learning and built

37
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.450 
a network out two hundred and fifty university partners. He launched

38
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.890 
the first industry accredited

39
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.660 
MOOCS and micro-credentials framework for european MOOC-platforms.

40
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.940 
And he he cares deeply about ensuring that people have access to high-quality education

41
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.450 
that impacts their lives, and he believes that universities should drive

42
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.980 
innovation to meet this growing demand of

43
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.030 
army, as he likes to call it, of adult learners

44
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.880 
and recently joined FourthRev. He is looking to take that

45
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.880 
mission to the next level by looking at like new models for skills education,

46
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.220 
which is an interesting concept also in the context of a university.

47
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.020 
So that's about Mark. Now then Dan Vigdor.

48
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.560 
I think he recently had his birthday and therefore has thirty

49
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.040 
six years of proven experience as an entrepreneur, building

50
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.390 
a purpose led organizations. He founded HackerU,

51
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.350 
which is a company that leads in cyber and digital skills education.

52
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.060 
And HackerU essentially partnered with universities to develop critical

53
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.620 
twenty-first century skills in the wake of the fourth industrial revolution,

54
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.210 
and places graduates in much needed sustainable jobs, and help

55
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.410 
them progress in their careers. He also cares deeply about education

56
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.830 
and its impact on society. Dan made his mission

57
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.150 
to help as many people around the world to gain new skills

58
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.430 
and land a new job and/or progress in their careers. So,

59
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.010 
two people who love education work closely with the universities

60
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.110 
and trying to tackle global challenge from different perspectives.

61
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.250 
Marc can I ask you to just give us a five minute

62
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.540 
bird's eye view of what you're thinking of at FourthRev,

63
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.340 
afterwards I'll ask them to do the same.

64
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.690 
Yeah sure! Thanks very much! Thanks for the introduction.

65
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.670 
It's great to be on a panel where we've all got the same haircut.

66
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.520 
So yes, I will get to give you a sort of overview of

67
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.280 
FourthRev, what we're thinking about. So

68
00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.150 
FourthRev is a relatively young company, it's been set up two years ago,

69
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.170 
and the the real problem we were hoping to to address is how do we

70
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.130 
basically try and contribute to solving the digital skills gap,

71
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.660 
working closely with universities. We feel that there's a lot of

72
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.300 
platforms, and obviously as part of future learning building

73
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.360 
up, there's a lot of

74
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.020 
effort going into scaling up and providing

75
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.590 
education to fill the skills gaps. But

76
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.270 
we all know those skills gaps are continuing and there's a lot of

77
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
the completion rights and things of some of those courses have been

78
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.100 
low so it's not always fixing the problem.

79
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.670 
So it's how can we start to address this and our approach to

80
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.210 
doing that was to actually think about

81
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.210 
partnering with global tech companies who have got the technologies and they're

82
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.950 
building up a lot of intellectual property and ideas about

83
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.870 
how their clients are using or need to use their technologies.

84
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.290 
But and to develop programs built you know leveraging their

85
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.950 
technologies, leveraging their insight, and their employer networks,

86
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.050 
and designing programs that would meet the qualification framework

87
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.220 
that universities operate. They can be level to master's or or undergraduate level.

88
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.550 
And we've been working with universities for them to use those programs.

89
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.960 
And underpinning that is really

90
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.580 
the view that if we're going to address the problem, we have

91
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.760 
to help universities do what I have always found has been the

92
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.090 
challenge which is to follow them and

93
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.440 
to actually bring the voice of the employer to bring that skills-based

94
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.190 
focus into the curriculum, and it's not something they do particularly

95
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.730 
well. I so freely admit that's not not what their previous mission has been about.

96
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.960 
So what we're doing is really trying to bring the best

97
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.690 
of what university has to bring; which is the critical thinking,

98
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.540 
and reflective practice, and other sort of curiosity intellectual

99
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.390 
curiosity, and those skills that university does best plastic's obviously deep

100
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.890 
inside the theoretical technical underpinnings of what

101
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.050 
people have to do every day which kind of set people up for

102
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.570 
long term success in their careers which given the the sort

103
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.660 
of tools, the behaviors, and those so the core competencies to evolve and adapt.

104
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.300 
But then combine that with the sort of

105
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.590 
so very practical project-based, hard nosed technical skills,

106
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.920 
employability skills that you need to really do the job that

107
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.650 
the companies need you to do. So there are emphasis now

108
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.860 
on building, a new program which we're where we will be soon

109
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:54.190 
which is fusing industry and universities together to really

110
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.400 
sort of co-create something that is developing both those hard

111
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.280 
skills but also consciously and explicitly

112
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.610 
the sort of human skills and twenty first century skills that people

113
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.410 
desperately need, which has all been accelerated in fact by COVID.

114
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.340 
Thanks so much Marc!

115
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.940 
Will pick up on some of the things that you've mentioned in the QandA,

116
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.270 
then would you like to to give a quick overview, so

117
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.290 
all the participants know where both of you

118
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.800 
stand if you will and then we'll take it from there.

119
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.310 
Sure, I won't go into the reason why we all have bald heads, but

120
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.880 
maybe I'll start with a little bit of background about myself and

121
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.730 
my partner and how HackerU actually became to be.

122
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.460 
My background I'm a serial entrepreneur, my dad put me to

123
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.820 
work very early age and really taught me the love of developing growing businesses.

124
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.290 
And I should say I learned a lot more from my failures than

125
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.640 
I did from my successes.

126
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.150 
But the last success before HackerU, was actually born free

127
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.820 
which was the first baby bottle that was toxic free.

128
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.450 
And this was important because it really showed me how much impact

129
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.390 
a purpose led organization has, both on the impact, and on the business.

130
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.570 
My partner after studying law and accounting about thirty years ago,

131
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.470 
he came into the workforce in Israel and saw a huge skills gap.

132
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.210 
Israel was starting startup nation and technology, and there

133
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:36.610 
was a huge lack of software engineers. He began training programmers and sub-contracting them.

134
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.290 
About fifteen years ago we opened up HackerU

135
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.690 
and built it to become the number one IT and cyber security training center,

136
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.130 
really concentrating on preparing people for the workforce

137
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.840 
and putting them into much needed jobs

138
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.890 
but five years ago we decided to go global and help

139
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.480 
global learners come into very needed

140
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.110 
and very in-demand cyber and digital skills.

141
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.290 
We started collaborating with top-tier institutions like yourselves

142
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.010 
with very comprehensive and rigorous programs

143
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.990 
that would enable people from different socio-economic levels

144
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.710 
come into very lucrative cyber fields and other digital skills,

145
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.300 
markets such as coding, digital marketing,

146
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.270 
UI UX, data analytics and so forth and really at the core of the company

147
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.390 
is to make generational impact,

148
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.380 
transforming people's lives through excellence, through excellent student experiences,

149
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.670 
through giving them excellent journeys and having making sure

150
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.860 
that they land a very lucrative job in digital skills but not

151
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.900 
only get the job but really survive and thrive, give them the

152
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.010 
all the practical and relevant technical skills they need

153
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.620 
to really make an impact in their job and continue learning.

154
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.850 
Goes hand in hand with also

155
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.080 
teaching them and making sure that they understand that

156
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.390 
they need to be lifelong learners. Digital skills is all the time changing

157
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.210 
and they need not just the technical skills but also the soft skills to survive

158
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.990 
and HackerU, we really have three northstars that carry the

159
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.130 
company together and forward.

160
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.530 
One and foremost is university success, university satisfaction, second one

161
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.220 
is student success making sure they find a job through a very comprehensive curriculum

162
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.810 
and the third is really making global impact.

163
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.610 
And our collaboration with universities is really a turnkey project,

164
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:46.360 
turn-key solution. We do all the investment: soon acquisition, the curriculum,

165
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.980 
the teaching and very most importantly, also, career services

166
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.900 
will replace students and jobs. We collaborate

167
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.290 
and we're very flexible with universities to really give them

168
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.420 
and for them to give us all the support necessary to bring

169
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.530 
up the best student experiences

170
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.920 
because what we found and what's most important for universities is really

171
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.500 
student success and in today's Covid world

172
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.050 
there's so many millions of people unemployed

173
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.970 
and as the world economic forum says eighty seven million jobs

174
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.510 
will be displaced within the next three years

175
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.780 
and actually ninety seven million new digital jobs will be created.

176
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.710 
This type of digital skills and practical training that ends

177
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.570 
up with a job is utmost important especially in this day an

178
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.090 
age of digital transformation.

179
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.190 
Thank you very much. Thank you both.

180
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:51.110 
I think I like the kind of ending on the on the displacement

181
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.030 
of jobs and the need to kind of

182
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.590 
get a the workforce to transform. A question that does

183
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.850 
arise is this is not what universities

184
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.910 
traditionally do and I was just wondering

185
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.360 
is: Why should university care about these nontraditional students?

186
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.810 
You know.. Why should they be important to university that focuses on

187
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:23.010 
graduating people with academic rigor in bachelor's and master's degree?

188
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.430 
So bit of..

189
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.740 
How do you call it.. provocative question, I hope.

190
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.530 
Who would like to take that first?

191
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.840 
I don't mind. Do I kick off then?

192
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.120 
Age before beauty.

193
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.400 
Ok. So.

194
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.830 
I think it's wrong to say actually that universities don't

195
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:59.100 
care about it. So many universities these days are already serving many many

196
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.880 
adult learners and nontraditional students. I think

197
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.170 
anybody who's adventured into MOOCS has already been doing that,

198
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.530 
it's just not in a often a very commercial way. It's been as

199
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.590 
a sort of mission driven way to disseminate education, disseminate knowledge, which is

200
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.780 
core to what the university does and of course

201
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.780 
in medicine and in education in other fields where there's

202
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.740 
sort of continuing professional development and research driven

203
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.120 
innovation and change, then it's been there all the time, so

204
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.500 
I think where universities have

205
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.030 
been held back is that there's a lot of

206
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.580 
traditional.. There's there is there's been a a lack of,

207
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:53.010 
I suppose, commercial imperative when ,you know, all universities, i've spoken to,

208
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.440 
and there's a strong part they depend upon the undergraduate

209
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.450 
market, there's a very stable

210
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.930 
pipeline of undergraduate students that want to have that undergraduate

211
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:09.490 
experience and benefit tremendously from that and employers still

212
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.520 
highly regard students coming out with a degree as sort of a benchmark of

213
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:19.780 
and signal of their analytical capabilities the general ability to perform

214
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.250 
a higher level so in many cases there's

215
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.770 
there's a lot of reasons to stay still and do that job well

216
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:34.110 
and focus those attentions there but I think what's beginning

217
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.390 
to change and more help universities to move into and care

218
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.580 
even more about non-traditional is just the speed of which

219
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.020 
curriculum has to evolve

220
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.550 
so we know we already know that engineering curriculum has

221
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.990 
a lifespan of around two and a half to five years. I think that's probably

222
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.540 
shortening computer science is probably

223
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.910 
doing the same and I think, you know, it's

224
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:04.210 
the idea that the traditional degree is actually going to be

225
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.770 
needed in the same way or consumed in a three year chunk

226
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.640 
as a useful way forward. I think is going to be up for

227
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.950 
challenge if things are moving so quickly. The traditional cycle of

228
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.170 
these programs is going to have to be

229
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.790 
thought about again. I also think that you know, you can't.. universities will..

230
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.430 
we cant really ignore.. I don't think governments will allow them to ignore.

231
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.430 
What Dan has already mentioned which is the huge challenge of

232
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.060 
of re-education that's going to be necessary. There are going to be

233
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.350 
five hundred million or so you know some projections from world economic forum

234
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.170 
five hundred million people will need upskilling or re-skilling over the next

235
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.900 
ten years. Lots of people are going to be having to transition

236
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.050 
out of work that's going to be disappearing and

237
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.240 
lots of people are going to have to.. analytics will be core of everything

238
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.710 
they do and not have to learn those skills so

239
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.320 
universities are.. except for schools, universities are the only ones

240
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.090 
with the infrastructure and presence in so many places and

241
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.350 
markets to be able to cope with that so I think, you know, universities

242
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.750 
if they're not thinking about it then they will soon be

243
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.020 
definitely having to think about it and find new ways and new

244
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.960 
models to service this market but as I say I think it already is

245
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.540 
beginning to happen. And so you think it's an external push

246
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.790 
rather than something intrinsic that they will..

247
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.280 
I think it's a mixture of both. I think now

248
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.750 
there is an external push, I mean again there's a lot of

249
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.450 
undergraduates tend to be quite a stable bunch and they're not very demanding

250
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.140 
customers, they don't always know what they need

251
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.770 
and therefore things have been quite sticky and a lot of it's

252
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.500 
been easy for several.. you know, universities to sit back and sort of wait

253
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.530 
for things to really here.. and you know there's been a lot of

254
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.630 
the Tech market has got a lot of full storms. We all love

255
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.710 
for the sake of promotion marketing and to talk up how quickly

256
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.650 
change is coming but everybody knows that doesn't always happen so

257
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.740 
I think the more we develop and just the speed of which things

258
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.760 
are going to happen now I think, is creating that awareness

259
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.010 
and I think Covid has done a lot of that, I mean it's done it for everybody

260
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.510 
but it's sort of made digital so much more real so much more

261
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.730 
obvious in terms of our consciousness that I think external

262
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.750 
awareness now is thinkable actually we need to

263
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.070 
change how we deliver to students at we are starting to feel a lot more

264
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.760 
adult learners are requiring re-skilling. There's going to be

265
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.720 
lots of changes companies are investing now significantly in this

266
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.030 
and that should trickle through into universities.

267
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.490 
I think.. But there's still that mission.. I still think the mission driven aspect of

268
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.560 
knowledge creation, knowledge dissemination means that it should be consistent.

269
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.820 
It's just how the how universities shift to the to the change

270
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.540 
in the demand that they're going to feel.

271
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.250 
I think that's reflected.. and Sha we'll pick up on that in a

272
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.470 
moment just to come back to Dan. You've been in space a while,

273
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.920 
maybe in terms of your experience could you maybe share

274
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.510 
with us what universities

275
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.550 
that you've worked with that cared deeply about these nontraditional

276
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.380 
students like what is there.. what has changed in them in the

277
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.090 
past few years or where do you see them care more about them

278
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.330 
than they did before and why.

279
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:46.510 
Well, I think everybody would agree with me that society is clearly still struggling

280
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.350 
with devastated job loss during the pandemic

281
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.300 
and really who's affected the most that should nontraditional

282
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.450 
students is our communities is the communities where the universities are at.

283
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.490 
Those students that lost their jobs, those people in hospitality and

284
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.680 
those people in our community are still looking for a job, for career change

285
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.810 
and having a difficulty accessing quality education.

286
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.290 
On the other hand industry is looking for did show practical skilled employees.

287
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.710 
about all over fifty percent of the world employees will need

288
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.390 
to be re skilled and that nontraditional students are filling

289
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.590 
in the demands both of the industry and closing digital skills gap

290
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.350 
and I think and have seen universities innovate in order to

291
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.480 
to cater to those nontraditional students, to cater

292
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.370 
to the industry and bring about

293
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.980 
the training that's needed for the employees

294
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.310 
of our industry, of our community

295
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.630 
and i think the shift

296
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.570 
actually think that universities that don't shift and don't innovate

297
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:03.030 
will fall back and i see that universities that are innovative

298
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.020 
and moving forward really are making making a name for

299
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.680 
themselves in the communities they are at.

300
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.370 
you know when

301
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:19.620 
putin and biden left the g eight they came out with two main

302
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.730 
points: one is military disarmament and the other was cyber security.

303
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.690 
How do we lower cyber warfare and cyber security?

304
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:32.250 
And so it's digital transformation and the need to tackle cyber

305
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.790 
security and the need to fill in over three and a half million

306
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.080 
jobs in cyber security worldwide is one of the biggest challenges

307
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.110 
the economy is facing today and I think the universities are

308
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.840 
picking up the challenge to answer those needs

309
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.950 
So.. Thank you.. I seen the chats..

310
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.090 
2 useful comments and maybe you can reflect on that a little bit.

311
00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:01.020 
one is: what is the role of.. you kind of answered part of it..

312
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.030 
like the role of educational institutions in this in a way..

313
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.290 
Why is it important for you to partner with universities on this

314
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.160 
and another question was around soft skills, is like

315
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.540 
yeah, I don't like that term particular but things like critical thinking

316
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.620 
we currently think that is really the bread and butter of a

317
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:29.460 
university. How do we link those those soft skills and continuous learning possibility

318
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.420 
in your programs. How do you do that. Mark.

319
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.040 
yeah, that's a great

320
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.730 
point, so I think in terms of

321
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:46.450 
marrying up universities and industry

322
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.680 
and.. why do we do that.. I think industry.. you've got

323
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.470 
tech companies who are producing only left to their own devices

324
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.520 
they tend to produce product..

325
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.810 
product led training.. so

326
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.820 
their motivation is to is to is to sell more product in the end

327
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.810 
it justifies the investment this is corporate social responsibility so

328
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.750 
they are doing some good but it's really so skewed towards their own

329
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.300 
their own technology

330
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.840 
and their own certifications that go with it

331
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.040 
and if you're just a an ordinary you know new provider

332
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.460 
in the world trying to to train people to do those good things

333
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.570 
and you're up against the disadvantage of a lack of awareness

334
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.560 
and you know you've got to build trust so

335
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.450 
being totally honest about some of these things most private

336
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.830 
companies partner with universities

337
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.790 
they they are working with and thank you you know leveraging that trust

338
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.870 
in the quality and rigor

339
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.560 
of of education that universities are providing and

340
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.190 
that being part of that framework of trust and of course over

341
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.270 
years and some of them are established universities have built

342
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:10.370 
up a brand and credibility that is you know extensive and very

343
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.180 
very important in terms of

344
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.900 
reaching the the marketplace with the with the product so there's a very

345
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.470 
clear reasons for that but I think the and that's why lots of

346
00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.380 
universities always suspicious of working with companies because

347
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.310 
they you know they say well you're leveraging our brand but what are we

348
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.710 
getting and do you really care about the experience

349
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.950 
I think we're what we're trying to fourth revenue what I'm

350
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.830 
passionate about doing is those those human skills I like to call soft softies

351
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.970 
a term that came because employers said they can't measure them

352
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.560 
but you can measure them but they're human skills and

353
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.990 
and I think they're what we're doing is

354
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.160 
you know universities I think do develop those critical thinking

355
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.980 
skills I've said they develop

356
00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.840 
riffs they should develop reflective practice helping you learn how to learn

357
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.800 
to sort of have inculcate that behavior so you're successful

358
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.680 
and the value of employees having a sort of intellectual curiosity

359
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.840 
knowing what questions to ask asking questions

360
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.390 
the right questions that take a company or business organization forward in some

361
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.340 
fashion

362
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.020 
but you know those things need to be brought out and the way we're trying to

363
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.290 
to do that is through project-based learning and the richness of

364
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.360 
the scenarios you create

365
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.580 
to sort of simulate that kind of complexity that you're confronted with you

366
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.950 
you don't often you don't often have all the data you know

367
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.500 
you have to find it you might have to research things on your

368
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.510 
own you're going to have to talk to people you don't have

369
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.100 
entirely super collaborative

370
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.780 
clients or stakeholders you you have to manage the human complexity

371
00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.910 
of relationships and presenting your arguments to people or

372
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.170 
trying to get things through a lot of the feedback from employers around what they

373
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.350 
what graduates miss not just doing a project it's talking to

374
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:11.880 
many many companies in the finance and accounting areas what they

375
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.970 
what they missing from graduates is that ability to

376
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.330 
know to challenge to ask the good questions

377
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:24.390 
to deal with the uncertainty to deal with stakeholders of different

378
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.030 
levels and how to pitch to them and talk to them and what they

379
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.880 
would care about not so by integrating some of that into the

380
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.560 
scenarios you can do that but they're not just doing that

381
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:37.050 
but trying to I suppose extract so

382
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.640 
mental models to help people reflect on what they're doing

383
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:47.640 
to learn and proactively develop their practice in working

384
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.860 
with people so you can arm people with the the frameworks and and

385
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.270 
and the tools to improve what they do I've always wished that if I had

386
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.790 
something that would help me reflect on every meeting I ever

387
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.680 
did for five minutes did I really do everything I can do with

388
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.050 
that come across get some feedback I would learn so much more

389
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.340 
but often we just don't do that so I think those things but

390
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.740 
last point I'll make is I still think there's a lot of soft

391
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.760 
human skills' that universities are not doing we just did a survey of

392
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.020 
in-house recruiters and HR directors in the uk across a

393
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.360 
hundred big companies

394
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.190 
and the feedback overwhelmingly you know some of the biggest

395
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.770 
skills I value is collaboration and teamwork

396
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.060 
ninety two percent that's a core skill that they are looking for from graduates

397
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.600 
but only eight percent think associate universities with really

398
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.530 
nurturing and developing that skill so you know there are things that private companies

399
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.000 
can work with universities on in those human skills I think

400
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.400 
as well to augment that but you know there's a lot of things

401
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.870 
around I think you know problem-solving adaptability communication

402
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.580 
growth mindset those are the kind of things alongside these

403
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.120 
days you know the twenty first century skills of remote working and

404
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.160 
clear cultural intelligence.

405
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.280 
Thanks, Mark. Dan, is there something you want to respond

406
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.940 
to directly or shall I follow up with a question? I think we can

407
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.480 
go to the next one because Mark was right on the button stop skills in and

408
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.900 
lifelong learning are all intertwined in everything one of our programmes

409
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.610 
because it's right there with practical technical skills, soft

410
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.180 
skills are as important and teaching people that they..

411
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.520 
learn how to learn in order to

412
00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:40.070 
make sure that their careers can survive and thrive in this very changing environment.

413
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.820 
Thanks. I think.. I mean, is this partly answering the question from

414
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.170 
Dora?.. thanks for keep the questions coming in the chat

415
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.460 
around the new skills pyramid and I think a critical point

416
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.790 
in her question is five to ten years from now so how are your

417
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.540 
offering and your models.. do you see them changing

418
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.460 
in the next five to ten years or do you think the same skills

419
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.950 
will be needed? Is the skill pyramid static or is it evolving

420
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.370 
and how do you respond to that?

421
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.650 
Well, technology is all the time changing so these skills will

422
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:17.660 
keep on changing just like we have to make sure that our cybersecurity

423
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.650 
course and digital marketing course stay relevant. We change it.

424
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.020 
In the last twelve months we've changed it two times so it's

425
00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.430 
all the time you have to make sure it's relevant and when we have

426
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.310 
quantum computing come and become mainstream that will be another

427
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.820 
skill, another program that will need to be added.

428
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.170 
So, I think that today what we serve our audience

429
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.380 
is really the five most in-demand digital skills which is of course cyber security,

430
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.030 
data analytics, full stack coding,

431
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:54.370 
digital marketing, user experience but this will grow, this will

432
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.340 
continue to grow and there will be new

433
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.300 
programs and new technologies that will be needed to be taught because

434
00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:05.700 
the change is so rapid so I'm sure the next five to ten years

435
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.640 
will be many more programs that nobody has even thought of yet.

436
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:17.820 
I mean.. I wish I could forecast ten years.. I mean they say, you know,

437
00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.210 
over the last two years ninety percent of the data that's been

438
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.830 
produced on the internet has been done in the last two years

439
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.260 
and it's just getting faster but

440
00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.450 
what I like about the future is .. I cant remember who it was but he said that, you know, it's not an

441
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:41.580 
AI versus humans, it's the opportunities AI with humans and it's the interaction

442
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.140 
between the two so..

443
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.820 
For now. Yea.

444
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.460 
So, I want.. the ability to..

445
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.900 
I still think where, you know, what technology skills you're gonna need I

446
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.150 
I think that's always a moving face everybody knows that

447
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:06.170 
there are the jobs in the next five years don't may not exist today

448
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.270 
and I think what it's basically saying is

449
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.950 
there's things evolving in everybody's job and some jobs are

450
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:16.230 
collapsing together and becoming extremely interdisciplinary but

451
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:21.140 
I think there's a sort of core platform level of technical skill which is

452
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:25.880 
around analytics. I mean analytics is permeating so many industries

453
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.250 
now in terms of health care, in terms of education, in terms of internal

454
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:34.060 
analytics. There's so much more data as we get more sophisticated

455
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:39.150 
within our pins or mining all the text, all the images, all the matter data

456
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.940 
out there to use that data for all sorts of ways. That will become

457
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.550 
a mainstay of many of our our lives not for everything but,

458
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.150 
you know, for certainly a good proportion of workers and then

459
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.590 
you're going to have robotics and machine learning and

460
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.690 
other things that are going to

461
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.260 
evolve but I think in terms of a human.. I mean, well, the only thing

462
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.610 
I know today is.. I don't believe in ten years the

463
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.750 
the role of human beings in terms of judgment,

464
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.820 
in terms of how we process and use that data, I don't think

465
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.980 
robots are going to beat us yet in terms of that integration

466
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.400 
of some of those things.I don't think they've got that yet

467
00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.020 
and I think stuff where it is dealing with humans

468
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.820 
is the stuff that's also still that protected and it's that

469
00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.610 
that emotional intelligence it's the connection, the rapport.

470
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.850 
Those sorts of thing communication which is all still important and

471
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:42.580 
I think in work to creativity innovation, you know, thinking beyond formula

472
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:47.440 
it's actually, you know.. it's that side of our skill-set which

473
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.350 
I think will always be very important, at least, certainly for

474
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.240 
the next ten years. I can't imagine anything changing that.

475
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.740 
But I think the biggest skill is to recognize that nothing standing still

476
00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.910 
and that's what Ben said as well it is the fact that

477
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.890 
we will need to adapt and then you can't re-invent yourself if

478
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.150 
you're not that naturally good at everything but

479
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.810 
there will be certain things you just have to be.

480
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.410 
And, I mean, in a way the assumption here to bring it back to

481
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:21.810 
the relationship between universities and an educational technology companies.

482
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.700 
How do you see the.. like.. What does a successful partnership

483
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.700 
look like in that front? Like, how do you make sure

484
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:37.290 
that you drive value on both sides where there's trust and

485
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.010 
there is also future path? Like, what is your vision for that?

486
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.010 
Maybe Dan, you want to come in on that.

487
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:50.020 
I think here the most important thing that we've learned

488
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.640 
both from our fifteen year experience and from university partners

489
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.780 
is that student comes first.

490
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.180 
Really, our partners are committed to student success and they have

491
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.520 
decades of experience to draw from this

492
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:09.850 
and they actually entrust us with that relationship, they trust

493
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.630 
us with their brand, with their name and trust us to represent

494
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.310 
them in the best way possible.

495
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.320 
So we keep on investing more and more and making sure we have

496
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.140 
the best student experiences.

497
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.870 
And through the best student experiences we will bring the best in outcomes.

498
00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:31.080 
So thats really bad quality; quality education, quality training

499
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:37.500 
and making sure that students succeeds and land the job because

500
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.960 
today people need jobs. Now thousands, millions of people are unemployed

501
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.350 
and today the student is not just looking for a degree but they're looking:

502
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:49.720 
"what am I getting out of this?".

503
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:55.340 
They're looking for that job and through excellent collaboration, transparency, open communication

504
00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.660 
and support, together we bring out the best an experience

505
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.500 
for today's learner.

506
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:09.250 
My take on that.. of course, I agree with all of that.

507
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:15.180 
in our model, in our interactions when we're truly sort of thinking about collaboration

508
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.300 
and a co-design process.. So, how do you really bring together?..

509
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.230 
Not sort of white label a piece of content or you know integrate

510
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.890 
something else into something else just to need that bit of content with you or

511
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.370 
I'll buy this program wholesale but a genuine co-design process,

512
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.130 
you need to recognize.. it's important for.. we need to know what we're bringing,

513
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.960 
in the expertise we bring and the university needs to know what it is bringing

514
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.150 
and I suppose it clarifies at the beginning ball.

515
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.910 
Yet, what is the value add of the university

516
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.610 
in the education we're delivering, how do we

517
00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:59.640 
make that an explicit part of what students are going to accomplish. You know, it's

518
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.810 
sometimes, you know, universities are associated with certain development of

519
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.760 
human skills or other abilities but you know it's

520
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.720 
in reality.. you really have to confront. well how much do we

521
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.240 
really do of that and I think it..

522
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:20.010 
I think by doing this with a view to getting people into work,

523
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.180 
to genuinely be able to evidence.. evidence the hard

524
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.820 
skills and those human skills

525
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.930 
in a the best way you can, forces you to confront

526
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.870 
how you're really designing your curriculum, how you are truly

527
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:40.010 
nurturing and providing the experience that is going to as Dan says;

528
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.080 
impress and get those people not just into work

529
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.960 
because a lot of students can fall down to their the technical

530
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.370 
but actually be able to progress in that career path

531
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.320 
and develop beyond and I think therefore..

532
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.830 
I think, that's about universities taking stock of well..

533
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.520 
I know, we've come from a very supply driven university, very supply driven approach..

534
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.490 
I'm a researcher..they need to see my research, they need

535
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.130 
to see the cutting edge thinking, they need to really understand the theory

536
00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.850 
to apply it well and at that richness and alpha companies are very super..

537
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.570 
the technical skills.. they are very skills oriented or they don't think

538
00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.690 
about it, they're not thinking beyond it.

539
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.430 
Universities have some sort of: "I want to do this program",

540
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.530 
and the market has to sort of receive it now they're raising

541
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.040 
burning glass and other platforms to try and provide a bit

542
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.380 
more richness and checking that it's doing what it's supposed

543
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.620 
to but I think we need to go beyond and say well actually this

544
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.940 
is really what they need. What does that mean because that data

545
00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.350 
is a bit sketchy. Let's really get under the skin of what those

546
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.460 
those people need.. How do we deliver that together? Where are

547
00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.290 
we strong and where are you strong and how do we marier it up?

548
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:59.280 
So, I think we're getting to a point where this is going

549
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.420 
to be interesting I think. So two things that I'd love to

550
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.910 
get your your take on:

551
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:09.960 
First of all, I just want to make a statement and and that is to make it

552
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:15.190 
clear, I think, personally, universities are pushing certain programs

553
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.690 
for a reason. They're research oriented, kind of.

554
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:22.010 
We have an assumption that universities knows and are thinking

555
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.610 
constantly about what is good for society, what companies need in the future.

556
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.450 
At the same time those same executives in the companies sphere,

557
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:32.790 
that are saying that the students don't have the right skills.

558
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.190 
When you ask them about their own university experience they

559
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.310 
love it. They said it was the best time of my life, it was actually

560
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:44.950 
fantastic and I would wish everyone else the same experience. So where..

561
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.460 
How does that fit with what you were just saying, Mark?

562
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.460 
I think the other challenges and I'll say it..

563
00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:00.890 
Companies also don't always know what they want.

564
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.450 
They.. Classic example of working with a company

565
00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.050 
is when they say: "I need my people have more commercial acumen,

566
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.160 
can you do me a course on commercial acumen?".

567
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.600 
And, you know, if you have something if you unpick it you realize they

568
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.120 
don't need that actually there's a lot of things that just

569
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.800 
you've not diagnosed the problem.

570
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.360 
I think its.. I can't sort of..

571
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.680 
you know say that..

572
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.900 
my experience university was also brilliant, right?

573
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.090 
But I look at that and I go: "Why was it brilliant?" and

574
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.900 
I'll be speaking personally, so from my experience

575
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.110 
I met a load of great people, I had tremendous intellectual conversations,

576
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.160 
I know my writing and analytical

577
00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:57.000 
ability was enhanced, I learned the skills of self study and

578
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.120 
to just get on with it

579
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.090 
and I cultivated a new network of people and you know that social

580
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.070 
and human development that you get just by being out of the

581
00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.310 
school context and into you know a very structured environment a more unstructured

582
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.120 
environment is adds to your learning there's no question if

583
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.330 
you know a good amount of time to really develop that but,

584
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.280 
I did history. Now what did I come out able to do

585
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:31.510 
actually? Not much, in terms of its country.. I struggled then

586
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.700 
or "what do I do now", "what am I actually trying to do" and I followed

587
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.610 
a path into a company that would take on graduates who are quite small, right?

588
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:44.420 
So, it was a sort of consulting career but that's,

589
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:50.230 
you know.. I didn't know excel, I wasn't known.. He introduced me

590
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.710 
to that while ago. I was around but I know people graduating now

591
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.730 
who have gone into banking and were told they need to know excel they've

592
00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.480 
gone through an economics program and still never used it

593
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:05.530 
in anger and had to be retrained. So, I think there's..

594
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.840 
I think people, as I said students, at the beginning I said students

595
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.650 
are always the most sophisticated

596
00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.430 
about what their needs are

597
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.190 
when they go in. They know there's an expected transition from

598
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:25.430 
school into going to university, you pick an academic subject in many cases,

599
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.710 
you go through and then at the end, you know, you think about

600
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.630 
your job and then you think what I'm going to do next and you

601
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:34.400 
just assume that the piece of paper that you've got is going

602
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.900 
to get there. I think what's happening now is students are

603
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.720 
,in certain, in UK, taking on more debt questioning what they're

604
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.070 
getting and can they pay that back and start to think harder

605
00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.080 
about: "is it training me up?" but

606
00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.530 
you know universities..

607
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.890 
Therefore need to spend a bit more time

608
00:41:55.490 --> 00:42:00.870 
worrying for the student, I believe about the tangible employability

609
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:04.250 
skills that they are arming their students with

610
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:08.090 
even if it's not core curriculum from a subject they may

611
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.590 
have chosen they still have, i believe a responsibility to be thinking

612
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.990 
what that student gonna do next because they can't.. you can't

613
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.370 
assume that everybody's going to go into academia next it's

614
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.480 
just not the route and the university would

615
00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.270 
be in horror if everybody was trying to become

616
00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.520 
a Masters or PhD soon,

617
00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.480 
so that's my view.

618
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.180 
Thank you. Dan,  do you want to come in?

619
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:34.320 
Well, I think that

620
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.800 
really today

621
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:44.530 
the students are changing. Technology has changed the world.

622
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.900 
My kids is instant gratification. They're looking

623
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.300 
for something that can help their future and help their future immediately

624
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.910 
and technology is evolven today in every single industry

625
00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.990 
and the speed and change is

626
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:05.220 
tremendous. I think Covid has woke up enterprise and shown

627
00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.690 
us all how not ready we are for digital transformation.

628
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:13.910 
So, I think, today the students are more as clients and they're more demanding

629
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:17.990 
and they're really asking: "what am I getting out of this?" and

630
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:24.210 
I have a nineteen year old, twenty year old, eighteen year old and they're asking:

631
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:28.390 
"what am I gonna get?","what's the output?", "what job am I gonna get out of this?"

632
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.220 
and it's very important to innovating to answer their needs and

633
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.610 
many universities today are changing a little bit their

634
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.940 
design and becoming more lifelong teaching

635
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.840 
and not just four years but maybe it's a twenty year program

636
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:50.270 
but shorter every year so, I think, education is changing, training is changing

637
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:55.430 
but also the goals and the outcomes the students are looking

638
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.880 
for from their university experience is changing.

639
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.750 
So coming back to my..

640
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:06.810 
Thank you, I think that really highlights the kind of

641
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:12.590 
need to adapt or figure out what to do with this new demand in the

642
00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.800 
market from our students and from companies.  Now, coming back,

643
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:20.920 
you mentioned something interesting, Mark, kind of putting the

644
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.610 
stakes in the ground in terms of your different models and approaches.

645
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.780 
You mentioned kind of the notion of creating together with the university while,

646
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:35.570 
Dan, you have a package of existing modules that you bring

647
00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:40.500 
to market with universities that if.. and I just wanted to hear

648
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.170 
you reflect on those models and what are the benefits or

649
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.960 
What does the future hold for those type of

650
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.360 
partnership models that you're proposing to do with universities?

651
00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.170 
Sure. So, our.. We actually have both models, so today we bring

652
00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:06.290 
very high level boot camps to universities where we actually

653
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:12.250 
are able to do a turn-key solution and bring about, for example,

654
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.500 
one of the best cyber programs for people who are looking for

655
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:18.710 
a program that at the end of the day they can come and start work

656
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:24.710 
but we're also think many universities ask us and work now

657
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:29.930 
to co-create programs together. So, for example, to take our cyber

658
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:33.760 
program to put it together with their engineering master's program

659
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:39.500 
and to come out we will bring out an engineering cyber security master's program.

660
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:44.420 
So we're incorporating when we have an relevant skills

661
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.320 
and curricula that we can keep relevant with the

662
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.730 
trends that are happening now in the market together with university programs

663
00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:59.120 
in building a program together, really co-creating what the industry today needs

664
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.360 
with having the best of both worlds with what the university brings

665
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.700 
and the practical skills that are needed today

666
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:09.550 
to do an amazing job in the market.

667
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:16.050 
What we're doing is..

668
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.120 
In the co-creation model is..

669
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.240 
We've partnered with

670
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:29.320 
ten of the global leaders in technology, so Microsoft, AWS,

671
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.620 
Salesforce, Atlassian

672
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:40.060 
and a bunch of others to be our partners in creating courses with

673
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:46.450 
universities as well as employers upon with the same goal which is

674
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.960 
in those digital realms to be able to

675
00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.510 
come up with something that takes people into jobs. But again,

676
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.850 
I think we will..

677
00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:01.420 
I think that is from reports I've read.. I've done a lot of reading..

678
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:06.470 
Everything I've seen in terms of how do we truly address the skills

679
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.590 
gap to get the people we need with the right sets

680
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:16.450 
coal for an integration or collaboration between employers,

681
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.050 
tech companies and universities

682
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.620 
and so the key is: "how do we make sure that we can

683
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:28.160 
develop enough of these and sort the programs and bring them

684
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:32.970 
through to a wider audience", and I know there are universities.. I remember

685
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.810 
Curtin University in Australia, for example,

686
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:37.930 
on its own initiative bringing

687
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:43.240 
as a mission to integrate, you know, employers and technology

688
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.320 
companies all the way through every single

689
00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.770 
area of their sort of curriculum in business, engineering and

690
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:52.060 
other things and it's an absolute goal over the next few years to re

691
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:56.020 
reinvent their curriculum in that way, so i think the more..

692
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.550 
this should become a greater

693
00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.670 
avenue for universities, i mean, genuinely collaborating with

694
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.670 
industry to produce more and more of their programs

695
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:11.540 
and that can be done.. they got the same choice as they would

696
00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.680 
with an APM, for example, you can choose to build it on

697
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.240 
your own or you can partner

698
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.700 
and partnership is often faster

699
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.720 
and if you've got the right partner who understands both industry

700
00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.190 
and how to work with universities well then that's the best way

701
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:31.040 
but the alternative is, you know, they there's also a part of

702
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.100 
our business where we are producing, we produce the courses, they are

703
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.630 
white-label, they can be licensed and the universities can

704
00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.970 
come off top and tell them to ultimately use them to accelerate that

705
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.190 
embed within their curriculum, so I think

706
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.200 
different models will emerge, but I would say this, you know,

707
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.760 
the co-creation model is not

708
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:58.170 
one we take lightly. It's an intensive one, it requires, you know a

709
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.230 
given take on both sides to get it right and an openness from the

710
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:07.350 
university and the academics to think: "Ok, yeah, I want to hear

711
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.580 
what industry has to say, I want that insight to help craft

712
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:14.640 
the program" and to, again, think where they add the most value so

713
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:20.670 
I think these models exist to me but scaling them with weight

714
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:24.630 
the scale is to replicate them in the universities that's why we think universities

715
00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.830 
are so important to the solution, that's their

716
00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:30.900 
most obvious route. we've got platforms but again,

717
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.890 
then you have all the issues around the rigor and what real

718
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.870 
support is done and how those business models which is all about

719
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.570 
a larger numbers-lower price. So that's an issue we haven't really

720
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:43.690 
touched upon yet you know..

721
00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.650 
if we're going to scale and get this out how do you make it

722
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.290 
truly affordable. The other barrier to this is not just

723
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.430 
is it online, is it open, is it opening rather but, you know, can we..

724
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.610 
can they afford it and I suppose that's one of the comments

725
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:02.010 
in here: "How do we help the global south?", for example, and people around

726
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.620 
who are in this to not fall further behind.

727
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:11.100 
Thank you, Dan. That's a really great comment and I wanted..

728
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.110 
That's almost a link to the name of the conference: The

729
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:20.250 
European MOOC Conference, massive open online courses. Kind of the

730
00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.140 
idea called the the roots of this tree that have grown for

731
00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.430 
for a number of years

732
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.530 
and do you think we need to revisit this notion of MOOCS or

733
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.680 
are you on the continuum of this or is this

734
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.480 
a break with MOOCS or is this something that will

735
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.080 
sit alongside with MOOCS?

736
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:42.880 
What are your thoughts?

737
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.960 
I think

738
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.960 
this is a.. It's a break with MOOCS

739
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.250 
in the sense that MOOCS were, you know, the name implies massive

740
00:50:55.910 --> 00:51:02.010 
and open, I think you can have programs that are open enrollment and

741
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.280 
all MOOCS are opem enrollment, all

742
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.370 
depends upon.. you've got to take them at your own risk which

743
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:10.110 
is do you have the attitude to be successful.

744
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.340 
so in the sense that some of the programs we will do will have

745
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:19.780 
requirements of english and certainly aptitude to succeed is the barrier

746
00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.910 
but that's no different from MOOCS but I think,

747
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.500 
are we expecting our program to be massive? No. You know, can

748
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:32.090 
we do that? No, because the model we have is a very high

749
00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:38.980 
touch support model because we think to develop the human skills

750
00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.260 
and to design that well and to coach people through and actually

751
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.500 
help the people who need that at most through and to find work

752
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:51.790 
is not a purely asynchronous, purely easily of scalable

753
00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:53.580 
experience yet

754
00:51:55.220 --> 00:52:00.610 
but should we remove the ambition to find ways that our content can be,

755
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.220 
you know, made available

756
00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:09.080 
for people to test their.. to develop the aptitude, to try

757
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.330 
one of these programs?

758
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.300 
Absolutely we should and so again it's..

759
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.830 
I think universities have may invested in MOOCS because you

760
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.390 
know there's a certain budget they can make available, there's a

761
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.970 
goodness that they can invest but they can again.. they can only go so far

762
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:28.100 
it's the same with us. You know, we will..

763
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:32.610 
we have an interest in increasing the supply of people interested

764
00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.100 
in these areas that we're operating.

765
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:39.320 
Opening that up, hoping that knowledge and that possibility

766
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.220 
up is very much in our interest as it is in the universities

767
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.060 
but then creek.. helping them and really supporting them

768
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:49.880 
through to be successful in the way we would hope

769
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:54.160 
unfortunately comes with with a price.. still.

770
00:52:55.740 --> 00:53:00.990 
Dan, are you the future of MOOCS or is it something different?

771
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.690 
I think we need everything.

772
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.810 
Everything. There is millions and millions of new jobs that

773
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:12.250 
will be created in digital skills and we need everybody to support

774
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.140 
to come in. I'll give an example: we had a ralph of a former

775
00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.930 
student that just graduated. He did three months before he came

776
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:24.700 
to us so he was introduced to cyber security through MOOCS. He

777
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:29.140 
also did a free whole session on ethical hacking in Youtube

778
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.580 
and he came to us when he was ready and motivated to take a very

779
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.340 
comprehensive and rigorous full program to have all the skills

780
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:42.860 
needed to get that cyber analysis job. So I think that..

781
00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.430 
it's.. you know.. it takes a village and it's gonna take a village

782
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.750 
to help out shorten the huge digital skills gap

783
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:57.980 
that's globally affecting, I think, all our communities, all our industries.

784
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:03.160 
So I think we need FourthRev, we need HackerU, we need the MOOCS,

785
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.610 
we need everybody to keep on growing and being able to give

786
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:12.430 
global learners a platform to be able to get the right training for them,

787
00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:17.530 
for them to make career change into to really excel in their careers.

788
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:23.180 
Thank you. I mean, this is a beautiful kind of a summary.

789
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:28.420 
I think, Mark, you couldn't but agree, I think, to what was just said.

790
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.080 


791
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:37.100 
but if there's one extra comment I would say. It's not in the higher education system..

792
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.290 
In the survey, we did we found that the real emphasis of employers is on the

793
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:46.480 
the secondary education so the stage before that.

794
00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:52.380 
If we're going to change that supply we have to go much earlier,

795
00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.160 
we have to rethink school curriculum.

796
00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:00.550 
So that, I think that curriculum transformation needs to come

797
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.520 
with digital transformation that's one thing I take away from this session,

798
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:08.560 
the second is a focus on human skills not soft skills and the

799
00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.990 
third would be university should be a worrying for the student and

800
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.540 
the fourth thing is very much kind of like: How do we get these

801
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.720 
this immense amount of people into jobs

802
00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:26.110 
and help them transform their careers", now with two minutes on the clock,

803
00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.850 
is there one piece of advice, one sentence or one point

804
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:33.070 
that you would like to..

805
00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:37.970 
for universities and people that work in universities kind of to hear

806
00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:39.740 
from your experience

807
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:44.010 
on what this brave new world of

808
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:50.600 
lifelong learning is going to bring to universities?

809
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.660 
Mark?

810
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:59.110 
Advice. Yeah, I suppose, my only advice is

811
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:06.730 
don't be afraid to try and just don't give up banging on your

812
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:11.700 
provosts or vice chancellors door to embrace

813
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.300 
the change that needs to happen.

814
00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.270 
That would be my advice. The constant thing i had

815
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:22.880 
in everything is: "how do we convince our vice chancellor and

816
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.950 
others to do what we think is right to do?".

817
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.960 
I had hair before I started working in this sector so.. Dan.

818
00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.520 
Yeah, I want to say maybe a little different point

819
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.550 
from a different look. I, personally, am very grateful

820
00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:44.170 
to be working with really amazing people in higher ed.

821
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:46.950 
We're going to keep being relentless

822
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:50.920 
in our ambition to transform people's lives. We want to impact

823
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.650 
over one million lives by twenty thirty

824
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.110 
and also I want to say that I'm excited

825
00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.860 
and excited because I see the accelerated movement towards digital transformation

826
00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:04.170 
in all aspects of life not just in education but really in

827
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:10.380 
all aspects of life so I'm very positive and very grateful and very excited

828
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.180 
and thank you for having us today.

829
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:18.260 
Mark, Dan, it's been an absolute pleasure. I love your perspective.

830
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.830 
There's so much you bring to the table and I could sit here

831
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:25.750 
for another hour, I actually look forward to doing this in personal and virtually.

832
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.880 
Thank you, distinguished audience, and I hope you enjoy the

833
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.490 
conference and hope to see you soon.

834
00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.220

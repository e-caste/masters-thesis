00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.089 
Now, we are at the end of our openHPI course: Blockchain - Revealing the

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.090 
Myth.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.160 
Let's summarize what we have done in the course.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.674 
First, congratulations, you have reached the end of our online course,

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.230 
you have stayed with us, you have come to us, thank you very

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.749 
much for this, it was a pleasure.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.679 
The learning objective of our online course was far beyond just

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.342 
explaining the technology, the technology behind the blockchain term,

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.203 
we confronted the term, the hype problem of the

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.330 
technology which is surrounded by

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.759 
several types of myths.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.130 
And with that in mind, we started the revealing of the myth

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.219 
of our blockchain technology at its cornerstone.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.630 
And the cornerstone of blockchain technology was the concept

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.780 
of the Bitcoin system.

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.549 
We have addressed the underlying issues that led to the creation

17
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.319 
of the Bitcoin system and each of the digital functionalities.

18
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.450 
And this year this was the paper that

19
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.409 
described the Bitcoin solution of

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.959 
Satoshi Nakamoto, it's not clear

21
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.240 
who it is, there are also myths around this, it

22
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.599 
could also be a group.

23
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.549 
And this paper describes the

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.159 
blockchain system and we started in the course with the definition

25
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.530 
of blockchain technologies.

26
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.990 
And from this, we have internalized the following advantages

27
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.349 
of that technology, which is offered.

28
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.059 
It provides permission-less and secure peer to peer

29
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.777 
networking without the need of a trusted third party,

30
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.030 
without the need for an intermediary that does not require

31
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.159 
trust between the peers.

32
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.979 
These are the basics of the requirements

33
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.335 
when the Bitcoin system was developed and then

34
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.659 
Ethereum was the answer to the needs of post-Bitcoin projects.

35
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.521 
With the insights into the post-Bitcoin projects, we have gained the impression

36
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.690 
of what the users and developers of blockchain-based solutions were

37
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.759 
missing in the technology at the time.

38
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.410 
Somethings could be provided with the blockchain

39
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.129 
systems of the second generation and some not.

40
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.952 
These needs have been successfully implemented by the Ethereum

41
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.093 
developers and their system blockchain 2.0,

42
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.759 
building a new independent blockchain solution on

43
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.289 
top of the existing blockchain solution using

44
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.939 
flexible and complex scripts, the smart

45
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.205 
contracts building on the solution on top of an existing blockchain

46
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.789 
with advanced features that are not yet implemented

47
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.589 
with the existing structure.

48
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.589 
Now, after having looked at the Etherium solution in direct comparison

49
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030 
to the Bitcoin solution, we found that the scope of the technology

50
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.289 
has changed, it has changed and is no longer

51
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.403 
limited to the field of cryptocurrency or decentralized registries.

52
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.849 
This is the UTXO based blockchain

53
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.854 
system, but it makes an evolutionary step to a programable,

54
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.415 
decentralized trust infrastructure, which is account-based.

55
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.759 
But the basis and idea, as well as advantages

56
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.669 
that our blockchain-based system has provided have remained unchanged,

57
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.659 
this is a permissionless and secure peer-to-peer network without

58
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.979 
the need of a trusted third party that does not require

59
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.520 
trust between the peers that are using it.

60
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.989 
So, the real challenge of the blockchain-based system is

61
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.763 
an attempt to make the blockchain-based system more efficient, more efficient

62
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.790 
becomes easier because it became popular.

63
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.879 
So, and as we saw that there are different possibilities, possibilities

64
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.600 
in three directions; in the direction of limiting the

65
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.810 
decentralization to make blockchain solutions more efficient,

66
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.986 
decreasing security to increase efficiency,

67
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.143 
of course, this is not desired as the security of the system gets lost.

68
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.019 
So, we have kept in mind the real challenge of blockchain-based system,

69
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.370 
and it's scalability.

70
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.249 
So, in particular, scalability is the parameter one

71
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.750 
places with different location-based variance.

72
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.249 
So, that was the actual unveiling of the myth.

73
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.041 
Finally, we saw how we can turn the theoretical understanding we have

74
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.530 
gained into concrete solutions to evaluate the solution, to understand

75
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.379 
the solution. But some questions remain unanswered.

76
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.211 
For example, the questions that are increasingly fuelled

77
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.309 
by the hype, such as the blockchain-based system, especially

78
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.054 
the best-known Bitcoin are increasingly and largely used

79
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.290 
for illegal transactions and are more suitable for criminals.

80
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.559 
This is a big narrative and discussion and there are a lot of

81
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.619 
examples but we learned that Bitcoin system

82
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.885 
and the idea behind is not

83
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.269 
discredited by this fact.

84
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.689 
Another unanswered question is that Bitcoin or Ethereum price

85
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.620 
is so volatile on the market, it is determined by

86
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.369 
the underlying blockchain technology but what is going on with the stock market

87
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.890 
with it is another thing.

88
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.679 
And among the most widespread headlines is the energy consumption

89
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.149 
of Bitcoin systems. We spoke about that, there is a huge

90
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.889 
need for energy, particularly for the Bitcoin system

91
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.424 
that's based on the proof of work, a consensus

92
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.429 
algorithm. We saw that all the energy that

93
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.019 
is needed to run the system is comparable to the energy needs

94
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.812 
of a whole country.

95
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.849 
To finally separate the technology from the hype

96
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.832 
let's briefly address the common questions: Blockchain-based systems

97
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.100 
are illegal? No, the system itself and the underlying technology

98
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.990 
do not distinguish whether it's used for legal or for an

99
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.022 
illegal purpose, the system cannot do this.

100
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.999 
The technique can be used by the users and the users decide what

101
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.350 
they are doing.

102
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.899 
So, it is non-profit, it gets no profit from

103
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.000 
being used illegally, just like gold

104
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.839 
or various fiat currencies such as

105
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.771 
euro or the dollar can also be used for

106
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.430 
legal as well for illegal things.

107
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.218 
The censorship resistance of blockchain-based systems may in fact arouse

108
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.540 
the interest of criminals to remain undetected.

109
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.769 
So, this is like encryption and other tools

110
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.139 
are used by criminals to do their work, to stay undetected,

111
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.790 
to make it difficult for authorities to follow them, but it is not the problem

112
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.470 
of the technology.

113
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.539 
Another interesting point is the Bitcoin and

114
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.720 
Ethereum price.

115
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.967 
It is determined by blockchain technology, we have learned that

116
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:48.019 
new bitcoins are mined and distributed to the miner

117
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.230 
as a reward.

118
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.406 
That means if you are not a miner, you would

119
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.290 
probably buy Bitcoins on a cryptocurrency platform

120
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.750 
in exchange for your Fiat currency, for a euro or for a dollar.

121
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.720 
But if you are working on the consensus algorithms,

122
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.179 
you can earn bitcoins.

123
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.659 
So, the cryptocurrency platforms have nothing to do with the Bitcoin system

124
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.409 
itself or its technology, they only provide

125
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.740 
interfaces where one can buy, for

126
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.760 
the traditional currencies like euro,

127
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.590 
one can buy Bitcoins

128
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.630 
or Ethers, but one cannot use Bitcoins and Ethers

129
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.100 
because only that one gets the equivalent.

130
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.429 
So, the Bitcoin or Ethereum price is determined by the supply and by the demand.

131
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.769 
If the demand for bitcoin increases the prices rise and if it decreases the

132
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.935 
price also decreases, and you know, there is huge

133
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.899 
piracy. Speaking about energy consumption in the Bitcoin system,

134
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.459 
you remember the proof of work, as we already know, is

135
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.380 
part of the security mechanisms of the Bitcoin system, this is an essential part

136
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.789 
of the consensus algorithms that provides a unique

137
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.709 
truth for all the participants of the peer to peer

138
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.010 
network nodes. Another part of the mechanism, is the

139
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.960 
difficulty target for the proof of work, this is

140
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.809 
to regulate the

141
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.559 
price of blocks that are generated, that it needs essentially work,

142
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.928 
computational work to create a new block, that there is a race

143
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.590 
between the miner and the miner in this way can earn

144
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.359 
a Bitcoin, but a lot of energy is needed

145
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.273 
and visit. With increasing interest in Bitcoin mining, with the aim

146
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.728 
of getting rewards for it, the number of miners, the

147
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.209 
people that want to buy blocks is increasing and then

148
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.855 
the blocks are mined faster and faster.

149
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.609 
So, with this difficulty target, it is possible to limit

150
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.039 
the system to 10 minutes, which is needed to

151
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.280 
about ten minutes that are needed to create a new block.

152
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.740 
If it becomes shorter than the difficulty target then

153
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.629 
the proof of work is increased, which

154
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.559 
automatically means that the hardware of the miners has

155
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.460 
to search even longer for the right solution.

156
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.584 
They need more powerful hardware and they need

157
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.919 
more energy to do this.

158
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.579 
So, in the end, energy consumption is increasing and

159
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.060 
increasing.

160
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.840 
That means the technology does not pose immense energy consumption.

161
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.620 
It is not specified somewhere to consume so or so

162
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.289 
much. We know that there are also alternatives to the

163
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:27.089 
proof of work. So, the miners alone bear the responsibility

164
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.320 
for the decision on keeping on upgrading.

165
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.339 
So, this was a short review of what we

166
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:42.169 
discussed in our course. Feel free to share your experiences and thoughts

167
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.799 
on these questions with other learners in our discussion forum.

168
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.770 
We are very interested in your remarks, your

169
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.599 
experiences, and hope you enjoyed

170
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.130 
the course and will take part also

171
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.179 
in future if we go back to this topic and

172
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.369 
run another course concentrating on other details

173
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.720 
on the blockchain technology. Thank you for taking part.

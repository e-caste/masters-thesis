1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.040 
Let's have a look to
some common attacks.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.060 
Let's start with denial
of service attacks -

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.200 
DoS or DDoS, distributed
denial of service attacks.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.460 
What does this mean? Such denial
of service attacks are attacks

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.550 
with the goal of disruption of
availability of a service.

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.480 
So the common user of the
service should not more able

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.570 
to access that service
and the DDoS

8
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.940 
the distributed denial
of service attacks are

9
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.040 
executed by a large number
of attackers which

10
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.420 
in the same moment try
to access the service.

11
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.910 
So they do not use
an exploits to

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.240 
misuse a
vulnerability, they

13
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.910 
try to get access to the
regular service of the system

14
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.420 
of servers or the system but
they do it with a huge number

15
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.950 
in the same moment so that
system is no more able

16
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.100 
to react in a right
away. Here is

17
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.750 
how such distributed denial of
service attacks are organized.

18
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.950 
There is one attacker and this
attacker uses a central

19
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.740 
command and control
server of a botnet.

20
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.340 
So typically denial of service
attacks are performed by

21
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.300 
so called botnets and
these botnets are many

22
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.810 
this are computers
which are infiltrated

23
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.780 
by malware, by malware that
the waits for a comment

24
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.730 
of this command amd
control server

25
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.870 
which says now access the
service and then in

26
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.920 
this moment all the
systems of the botnet

27
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.050 
in same moment start to
try it to get access

28
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.010 
to the servers. In this way
because it's a huge number,

29
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.680 
a very huge number sometimes
millions of computers

30
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.640 
the system is no more able to
react in the right away.

31
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.270 
To give some examples - for
example there was publicly

32
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.090 
known the low
orbit ion cannon -

33
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.100 
the LOIC. It was a
network testing software

34
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000 
that can be misused for
such type of an attack.

35
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.470 
So actually means to check whether
the network is sufficient

36
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.960 
resistant to denial of service
attacks. This software was

37
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.700 
designed to check
whether a system can

38
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.850 
if such a denial of service
attack is started

39
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.020 
against the system that
systems can resist.

40
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.390 
But of course also by this
software can also be misused

41
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.780 
by the attackers to perform a
real denial of service attack.

42
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.710 
For example another known
example for such denial of

43
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.090 
service attack was the
operation Avenge Assange.

44
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.160 
This was a distributed denial
of service attack against

45
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.790 
mastercard against visa
and other websites

46
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.400 
and the reason for the attack
was a political decision

47
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.880 
to stop the processing
of WikiLeaks donations

48
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.950 
because of these
discussions and the

49
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120 
assertions against
Assange, the founder

50
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.910 
of WikiLeak. Another type of
attacks comes from malware.

51
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.610 
Attacks like virus
worms, trojan attacks

52
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.500 
malware. This is an artificial
word constructed from

53
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.080 
the first part of malicious and
the last part of software

54
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.750 
so malicious software -
this is malware

55
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.100 
and viruses, worms, trojans are
examples of as such malware

56
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.940 
for example virus. A virus is
a destructive mini program

57
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.200 
which usually come as
an unwanted payload

58
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.380 
of contaminated
applications.

59
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.170 
Worms as another type
of such malware

60
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.740 
this malicious software that
distributed itself automatically

61
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.460 
via open network
connections.

62
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.390 
Then we have another
example trojan horses.

63
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.930 
Trojan horses, this is a malware
which often unintentionally

64
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.230 
installed on a computer
system by a naive user

65
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.040 
and the functionality that is
shown by the trojan horse

66
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.850 
is different from what
the user is expecting.

67
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.230 
So for example it provides a
back door or it's for logging

68
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.590 
the passwords in the background.
So such trojan horses for

69
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.120 
example shows a page where
you can log in a service

70
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.620 
but it is not the original page
it's the page by the trojan horse.

71
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.820 
So the user gives in his
username his password

72
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.450 
and then the data are collected
by this trojan horse

73
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.230 
and sent for example over
the internet to the

74
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.940 
hackers and then the real
login page of the system

75
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.170 
came with the remark that
there was a misspelling or

76
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.980 
other things. Another example,
a more dangerous example

77
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.780 
not more dangerous

78
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.940 
which was a big discussion in
germany this was a so-called

79
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.310 
Bundestrojaner, the
federal trojan

80
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.020 
and it was developed
by the German police

81
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.250 
to eavesdrop voice over
IP software and then

82
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.740 
it became famous because
the computer chaos club

83
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.040 
analyzed the software and found
out there were weakness and

84
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.560 
bad design and another thing. So
it was a big public discussion

85
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.860 
about it. First examples
will be presented when we

86
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.110 
discuss in the course
how this malware

87
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.900 
is installed on the computers,
what needs to be done

88
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.640 
to prevent it from such a thing.
Here we want to give an overview

89
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.780 
about different types of
attack another type

90
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.190 
a dangerous type of attacks
is spoofing and phishing.

91
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.930 
Spoofing this is the idea that
an attacker sends a message

92
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.450 
with a fake sender address
for example fake

93
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.940 
IP address or an email address
for example with the name of

94
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.970 
a family member or with
the name of the boss

95
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.590 
and this spoofing can be done
because in the email systems

96
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.390 
it is not checked whether it's original
sender address or whether

97
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.100 
the email comes with a
fake sender address

98
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.870 
so this spoofing, it's not only
possible with emails also

99
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.930 
with other communications.
Spoofing

100
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.180 
is often used in connection
and to prepare other attacks

101
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.050 
for example it's often used
in connection with phishing.

102
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.420 
And phishing, the method
of social engineering

103
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.750 
encourages user to reveal
password and the others.

104
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.900 
The attackers prepare and
send fake emails or

105
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:57.820 
fake sms or fake calls and
try to push the user

106
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:04.190 
to go to a website, to reveal
some internal information

107
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.940 
or others. To give an
example an e-mail

108
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.330 
comes with the fake sender address.
So it's as spoofed email

109
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.280 
and promts users to
open a fake web page

110
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:23.240 
and this web page has very strong
similarity with a web page

111
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.260 
of a real service for
example with a bank

112
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.110 
or others or facebook.

113
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.130 
Then the users are prompted to
enter their own user data

114
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.010 
username, password, credit
card number and others.

115
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.600 
This is not sent
to the service

116
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.750 
the user knows, it is
sent to the attackers

117
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.410 
which prepare the website
that looks very similar

118
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.400 
to a real service.
Defacement, this is another

119
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.590 
attack which is
dangerous.

120
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.430 
Here it's an attack against
defacement it's an attack against

121
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:11.400 
a website or web server and the
aim of such defacement attack

122
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.210 
is that the content of
the web page is changed

123
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.880 
so deface, change of face and
such defacement websites

124
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:27.120 
are used for fishing of user data
for example user has no way

125
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.700 
of knowing that
changes of web pages

126
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.430 
are unauthorized changes. He has
given the link as usual for

127
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.310 
example of his online bank
or of another service

128
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.810 
and in reality by

129
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.620 
means of the change of the
content of this website,

130
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.640 
for example there is
the wish that this

131
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.120 
service asked him
to look to a

132
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.890 
link, to another
for example

133
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.250 
website with malware.

134
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.160 
The attackers can acquire
sensitive identity data,

135
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.260 
passwords, credit card numbers
in this way because the user

136
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.050 
feels that he is on
the usually website

137
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.410 
and that for example
everytime he wants to use

138
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.390 
an online banking service
we have to give in

139
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:27.290 
this data. The defacement is
also done for example for

140
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:32.560 
self promotion of hacking groups,
it is done for political

141
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.530 
propaganda, it is done for an
attack on availability, here

142
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.800 
for example is an example that looks
very much like a google page.

143
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:47.750 
It is a google website for
Palestine which was defaced

144
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:53.670 
by giving content
which did not come

145
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.580 


146
00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.400 
by google which was
changed by hackers

147
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.100 
for example question
what would happen if

148
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.320 
we changed the country title
of Israel to Palestine

149
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.700 
in google maps, it would be a
revolution, so listen to Rihanna

150
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.650 
and be cool and then
you see here things

151
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.610 
for example Israel
is not called.

152
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.810 
So there is some political
content and political

153
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.480 
propaganda done in this
way with this defacement

154
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.420 
attack. Another family of
attack is sniffing and

155
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.610 
eavesdropping. Sniffing
is the name for

156
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.690 
methods developed for
network diagnostics.

157
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.630 
Network diagnostic is important
for the administrators

158
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.990 
to check whether the network
works in a correct way and for

159
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.130 
that reason the
administrator can listen

160
00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:00.920 
to the entire network traffic, to
check whether there is performance

161
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.520 
ok and packets are not lost and
others. The system administrator

162
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.380 
can detect and analyze
network traffic errors

163
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.190 
by means of such sniffing
software for example wireshark

164
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.180 
is a famous software
sniffing software

165
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.900 
designed for the
administrators but of course

166
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.570 
hackers, attackers
can also use this

167
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:31.230 
software can also try it to
listen to listen to all what's

168
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.220 
going on inside the
network, so they can

169
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:43.060 
attack, they can eavesdrop
all what the participants

170
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:48.040 
of the network are doing, what kind
of mails they are exchanging

171
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.870 
so we can check and listen
to every data package

172
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.250 
and can for example try to
identify passwords or other

173
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.510 
sensitive information. An attacker
connects to the victims

174
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.700 
network, collects and analyzes
all the IP packets

175
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.290 
with the aim to extract for
example identity data or other

176
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.590 
sensitive private data from
that simply by using such a

177
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.810 
sniffing software and eavesdropping
what's going on in the network.

178
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.960 
The attacker of course can
only read unencrypted

179
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.850 
traffic. So all messages
that are unencrypted

180
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.090 
maybe seen by
the attackers.

181
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.950 
If one wants to do something
against such eavesdropping

182
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:46.190 
attacks, one has to take care that
data sensitive data encrypted

183
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.280 
one can not prevent the attackers
internet is an open network.

184
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.410 
So one can not prevent that the
attackers listen to all what's going

185
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:59.430 
on but one can prevent
that they understand

186
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.180 
the content the detail
of this communication.

187
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.200 
Of course is where only a few
examples. There are further attacks

188
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.310 
on IT systems for example
unauthorized physical access

189
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.220 
to computer system, laptops
theft, cellphone theft,

190
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.090 
burglary in server
rooms and others.

191
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.830 
Social engineering attacks
are quite dangerous.

192
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.550 
So not only for
stealing passwords

193
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.450 
as in the phishing example
but also for other

194
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.960 
kind of attacks, attacks to
decrypt identity data,

195
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.400 
for example to get access for
example by infiltrating malware

196
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.130 
to get access to information
before this information is

197
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.540 
encrypted, password
cracking attacks

198
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.870 
to decrypt the
hashed password,

199
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:03.580 
password guessing is
a successful attack

200
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.530 
because many people
do not take care

201
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:13.030 
that they select strong passwords.
We will learn more about

202
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:19.060 
such attacks when we are
discussing malware in

203
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.540 
the base, how malware
comes to your computer

204
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.260 
in a later week.

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.810 
Welcome to knowledge graphs. This
is lecture number one, knowledge

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.330 
graphs in the
web of data.

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.090 
In this part of the lecture
we are going to talk about

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.320 
the art of understanding. What
does it take to understand?

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.330 
So I have an
example for you.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.710 
Let's try that one - climate change
is the Everest of all problems.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.870 
What does it mean?

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.340 
I might give you a clue what Everest
in that context might mean.

9
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.420 
So Everest of course is a term which is
ambiguous and which might stand for

10
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.090 
several different terms. But exactly
if you use it in language like that

11
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.340 
then it means Everest it's the highest
mountain on earth, that means

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.600 
this is one of the most serious, most challenging
most complicated and difficult problems

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.730 
to solve. This is only an example
why understanding sometimes

14
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.000 
really is difficult. So
what does it mean

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.570 
to understand?

16
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
Understanding in general is the
ability to grasp the meaning

17
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.920 
of information that we have seen
there. And information we know

18
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.570 
that already is conveyed in a message
using specific language from a sender

19
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.360 
to receiver. And now information
is only then understood

20
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.360 
by the receiver of a message if the
receiver interprets this information

21
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.600 
correctly.

22
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.000 
If the receiver doesn't interpret
it correctly, so if he interprets

23
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.360 
the information in a wrong way then
of course he did not understand

24
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.770 
the information. So therefore
understanding is bound

25
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.810 
to correct interpretation. This
is essential for understanding

26
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.550 
and this is what really
understanding in our context means.

27
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
You have also seen already that semiotic
triangle here just as a reminder.

28
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.490 
The symbol or the bird in the
language that we are using stands

29
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.780 
for an object in the
real world. However

30
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.150 
when you receive a message that
contains that kind of symbol,

31
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.730 
it symbolizes some kind of concept
that is raising in your head

32
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.600 
while you hear or perceive, you
know, that kind of symbol.

33
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.740 
And only in the case if sender and
receiver have the same concept

34
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.350 
in mind which means they
interpret the symbol correctly

35
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.550 
then they understand
each other.

36
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.600 
And this is dependent on as you see
here on context, on experience,

37
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.470 
on pragmatics. And what all this means
we will going to find out soon.

38
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.040 
So correct interpretation of
a message depends on

39
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.830 
syntax, semantics, context, pragmatics
and in the end also on personal

40
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
experience. Let's start with the
most simple one, let's start

41
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.200 
with syntax. So what is
syntax? You all know that

42
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.840 
syntax is a word that comes from Greek
syntactical source and syntax means arrangement

43
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.620 
ordering. So what does it mean in grammatical
for example, syntax denotes the study

44
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.910 
of the principles and process by which sentences
are constructed in particular languages.

45
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.330 
However for example if you go
to formal languages like they

46
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.950 
exist in computer
science or linguistics,

47
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.930 
syntax is nothing else but a set
of rules by which so called

48
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.080 
well-formed expressions can be
created from a fundamental set

49
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.580 
of symbols which is the alphabet. So
it's about distinguishing well-formed

50
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.240 
and not well-formed
expressions.

51
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.380 
As a computer scientist you might
think of a parser which is able to

52
00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.060 
read some program code or some
encoding like for example html

53
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.540 
the language which you are using
to encode information on the web.

54
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.420 
And if the parser parses exactly
that kind of language correctly

55
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.060 
it means it's well formed, it's well
structured, it does not produce an error.

56
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.700 
But that does not really mean
that it's also understood by

57
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.670 
its content. It only means it's
well structured and this is what

58
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.930 
syntax is all about. In computer
science in general usage syntax

59
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.930 
defines the so called
normative structure

60
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.880 
of data. So this is syntax. Only the first
level of understanding. Of course

61
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.700 
syntax must be correct, you have to
deal with well-formed expressions

62
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.860 
and then you have to go the next step,
you have to think of what might now

63
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.470 
these structures really mean. What's
the semantics of these structures. So

64
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.980 
the next layer is the
semantics layer.

65
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.500 
Also a greek expression
semanticÃ´s this means

66
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.920 
it pertains to the character
or the study of meaning.

67
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.630 
Semantics is part of linguistics
of course and this focuses on

68
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.020 
the sense and the meaning of
language our symbols of language.

69
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.140 
And usually manages the study of
the interpretation of these

70
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.220 
signs and symbols as used by
agents or communities which in

71
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.450 
within particular circumstances and
of course within a particular

72
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.430 
context. As you see here semantics
already is dependent on the

73
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.880 
context on the surrounding. So you
might have different semantics

74
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.130 
for the same structure depending
of course on your circumstances.

75
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:40.030 
However semantics means also or it asks how
sense and meaning of complex concepts

76
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.400 
can be derived from simple concepts
and this done usually based

77
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.270 
on some syntactic rules. So you
use rules of syntax to derive

78
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.690 
the most complicated constructs from
the easier construct. So this is

79
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.810 
the way how semantics works. And
as we already have told you

80
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.350 
semantics of a message
depends on the context

81
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.440 
and pragmatics. And of course we now
have also to define these two

82
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.330 
constituents of
understanding.

83
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.300 
So next point. After we have talked
about syntax and semantics now

84
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.140 
we have to talk about context
because in different context

85
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.380 
the meaning of a message might be
different. So what is context?

86
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.100 
This is a term that now comes from latin.
Contextus means interweaved. So this

87
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.290 
already shows you that we are
dealing with the surroundings

88
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.240 
and of course the circumstances
of a message. So context denotes

89
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.040 
the surrounding of a symbol or
concept in an expression, respective

90
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.750 
its relationship with surrounding
expressions or concepts and further

91
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.590 
related elements, so that the basic
formal definitions. So context

92
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.620 
denote all elements of any sort of
communication that define the interpretation

93
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.530 
of the communicated content. So
it also depends on the way how

94
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.020 
you speak, for example if you are loud,
if you're using a low voice,

95
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.800 
if you try to, let's say, shout
or are angry and stuff

96
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
like that then of course you see
this is a different context.

97
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.500 
If there are different peoples
around you might change of course

98
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.230 
the way how you communicate your
message because you have to

99
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.580 
adapt also to that kind of context
that you have here. So this

100
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.710 
is the social context, meaning it
depends on whoever you speak to in

101
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.120 
social context.

102
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.560 
Next thing of course you
as a speaker you might

103
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.660 
convey the same message but you
might have different intentions

104
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.180 
at one time or another time. You
know sometimes you are completely

105
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.830 
serious about what you're talking about,
sometimes you are speaking ironically.

106
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.300 
You want to make a joke; this of course
then is related to pragmatics

107
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.920 
and this is also a Greek term
which comes from the Greek word

108
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.040 
for action and this
reflects the intention

109
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.190 
by which language is used to
communicate that kind of a message.

110
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:15.380 
So in linguistics pragmatics denotes
the study of applying language

111
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.930 
in different situations and it also
denotes the intended purpose

112
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.980 
of the speaker. We have talked about that
that sometimes the message might be

113
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.720 
meant completely serious
or it might be that you want

114
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.800 
to make a joke or you want to be
ironical or sarcastic. So these

115
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:39.020 
are different kind of purposes. And therefore
pragmatic studies the way

116
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.760 
in which context
contributes to meaning.

117
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.380 
In the end so after syntax,
semantics, context and pragmatics

118
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.310 
the meaning and the interpretation
especially the correct interpretations

119
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.710 
so the understanding of a message is
also depending on the experience

120
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.960 
of the participating parties. So
have the experience of the sender

121
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.280 
and the receiver.What does that mean? So
experience here consider all information

122
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.000 
that you have learned and put
in context with the world you

123
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.520 
are living in. So this is your personal
experience and this of course determines

124
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.970 
how you interpret
messages.

125
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.910 
So for example when you have
ever if you have ever only

126
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.470 
dealt, let's say, with people
who meant no harm to you

127
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.330 
you might act completely different
as in a world, you know, which

128
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.880 
is rather competitive and where you have
to take care about the other people.

129
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.160 
So for example that they
mean no harm to you.

130
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.640 
So experience in this sense is
often referred to also as lets

131
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.730 
a common sense knowledge and also
world knowledge. So your experience

132
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.140 
determines in how you phrase your
message and how you interpret

133
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.520 
these kind of messages.

134
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.150 
So now we have learned about all
the ingredients for that

135
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.970 
kind of soup of understanding
that is necessary. How do we mix

136
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.320 
it now together? So for successful
communication what do you need?

137
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.180 
First of all information has to
be correctly transmitted. We

138
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.050 
know that that's the syntax there we
have the rules of syntax for.

139
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.610 
So the structure is ok. So therefore correct
transmission means syntactically ok.

140
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.010 
Then the meaning of that message,
the semantics of the transmitted

141
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.030 
information must
be interpreted

142
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.150 
interpreted correctly. So this is
the understanding and of course

143
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:39.810 
this kind of understanding depends on
now the context of both sender

144
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.720 
as well as of the receiver and
of course of the intention of

145
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.860 
the sender. This is the pragmatics
of the sender, so this is

146
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.980 
really really important
for understanding.

147
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.860 
And then in the end the personal experience
of sender and receiver determines how

148
00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:01.810 
sender and receiver interpret the semantics,
context and pragmatics of a message.

149
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.750 
And thus is that its intended
meaning. So this is the out of

150
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.970 
understanding and you see
what it takes to understand

151
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.260 
meaning which is represented
in language in a correct way.

152
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.040 
And in the further course of that
lecture we are going to show

153
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.540 
you how we can bring most of these concepts into
a so called formal knowledge representation

154
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.920 
and apply this in large scale and to
form so called knowledge graphs

155
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.820 
out of it.

156
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.010 
This is what it takes to really
communicate meaning and to help

157
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:45.330 
a receiver to understand what is the
content, what is the meaning of

158
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:51.330 
a message. And in the next part of the
lecture we are trying to go towards

159
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.690 
a so called universal knowledge
representation to show you how

160
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.500 
knowledge can be
represented.

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.406 
Yeah, welcome back to the next video clips where we talk about mainframe security.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.039 
When we talk about mainframe security, you often hear messages like

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.009 
the IBM mainframe is the securest commercial operating system available.

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.499 
In our opinion, this is not quite true.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.639 
We want to modify this quote and these messages.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.319 
And in our opinion, we want to modify this statement to the IBM

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.089 
mainframe is the most secure operating system available.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.529 
So you have to do something. The message behind this modification is a lot has to

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.969 
do has to be done to get the mainframe really secure.

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.559 
And if you really do all the stuff that is necessary, it is

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.939 
the securest commercial operating system available.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.789 
But it comes not by itself, you have to do something.

13
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.629 
IBM has developed a system integrity statement,

14
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.669 
support, security and integrity since the beginning,

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.199 
since more than four decades, and important aspects

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939 
are storage key and APF, APF stands

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.869 
for the association program facility.

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.559 
And these things lead to the so-called

19
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.169 
EAL Evaluation Assurance Level five-pluscertification.

20
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.789 
And very important this certification in this really high

21
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.349 
level is really just available for z/OS in an LPAR

22
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.034 
and not for z/OS as an example under z/VM.

23
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.469 
And here is the integrity statement from IBM.

24
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.629 
And when you look into the fine print, I just want to emphasize

25
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.549 
a few things.

26
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.409 
It's the first issue was from 1973.

27
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.969 
So it means today it's really 45 years ago

28
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.679 
where this statement was issued from IBM.

29
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.210 
And so serious security

30
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.709 
plays a crucial role. It's the Resource Access Control Facility,

31
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.229 
protection key play a really big role because the protection key are

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.539 
implemented into the hardware.

33
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.079 
And this is the reason that the EAL five plus

34
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.019 
certification is really just available for z/OS, in

35
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.639 
LPAR because LPAR runs directly on the hardware

36
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.289 
and the protection key is built into the hardware and is

37
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.580 
the main important idea of this very, very

38
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.699 
sophisticated security environment when it comes especially

39
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.279 
to z/OS environment.

40
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.349 
And already mentioned z/OS programming facility

41
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.523 
is also important, the APF.

42
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.939 
What means security? When we talk about security, there are two important aspects.

43
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.039 
One is the physical security, means normally

44
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.099 
we are really accustomed in mainframe environments.

45
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.689 
So especially in financial institutions or

46
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.729 
insurance companies and so on, it's not possible to go directly

47
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.699 
to the hardware to have direct access to the hardware.

48
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.609 
You have to do some identification.

49
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.199 
And in this case, the physical security, of course, plays an important role.

50
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.119 
The second thing is backup and recovery.

51
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.449 
And when it comes to backup and recovery, we talk about suplex environment.

52
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.949 
This is a file of such a suspect's environment where you have

53
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.689 
two computer centers and all the data is synchronously

54
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.279 
available in both computer centers, normally in many cases

55
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.779 
is at least 10 kilometers distance between between

56
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.699 
these computer centers. And then what is if one computer center fails,

57
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.730 
the other computer center can directly

58
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.799 
take over all the running transactions.

59
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.629 
So no data is lost, no transaction failed or the

60
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.909 
execution runs further on on the other computer center.

61
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.679 
What means what is the second part is the operating system, and in this

62
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.149 
case, it's shown that the system and integrity has to

63
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.799 
be implemented. I already talked about the authorized programs and

64
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.349 
the APS facility.

65
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.079 
We have a so-called program property table.

66
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.050 
We go into more detail on one of the

67
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.169 
future unclips video clips about security.

68
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.049 
See, lock files are really important and

69
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.579 
also not just with security, but also with the

70
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.049 
security system. Management facility is one of the really important

71
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.729 
components built into the operating system, locking all the events

72
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.439 
that come up during the running

73
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.939 
operating system. We talk about cryptography and z/OS

74
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.099 
security. So, of course, with Iraq, if all there are some other equivalent

75
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.899 
products from other windows, but you need a security server to

76
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.489 
manage such a security environment.

77
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.409 
And this is a structural example of our

78
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.009 
education environment in this case.

79
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.689 
Just an example how it is structured and how it is implemented.

80
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.279 
You see the hierarchy of such a safe environment.

81
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.029 
We go into much more detail with some further clips.

82
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.919 
It's just to show the the idea of

83
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.919 
such an environment.

84
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.219 
That's enough for this video clip.

85
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.199 
We also talk about hardware, cryptography, and

86
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.969 
we also talk about pervasive encryption, a very new

87
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.039 
security environment that was introduced with a very new C14

88
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.899 
process of family. We talk about all of these things with doing

89
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.599 
the next video clips.

90
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.619 
So in this case, have fun with security on IBM.

91
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.880 
Mainframes with Felser keeps coming up during this week, Thangaraj.

Welcome to knowledge graphs. This is lecture
number four knowledge representation

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.120 
with ontologies. Before we dive down
deeper into knowledge representation

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.060 
and formal languages to knowledge representation
with a web ontology language later on

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.480 
we will first give you a brief
recap of essential logics. Since

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.940 
all the knowledge representations we
know that already they build upon

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.250 
logics. So we want to refresh
your knowledge on basic logics.

7
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.540 
We start first with a very simplest logic,
this is so called propositional logic.

8
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.080 
You all know propositional propositional
logic from school. There

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.870 
the world consists simply only of facts
and nothing else so you have statements

10
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.530 
of assertions, that's it. And for example
you can say for example if it rains

11
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.520 
the road will get wet or if the
moon is made of green cheese

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.020 
then cows can fly or if oliver is
in love then he will be happy.

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.790 
So the world in propositional logic
consists out of objects and properties

14
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.530 
that distinguish one object from
another that's all. And between

15
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.810 
those objects there are relations.
And some of these relations

16
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.110 
they might be unique so for example
they might be functions. So

17
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
let's have a look at the syntax
of propositional logic.

18
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.610 
You all know we need in propositional
logic some kind of logical

19
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.220 
connectives. So we have negation meaning not
we have conjunction that's logical AND

20
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.210 
we have disjunction that's the OR,
we have an implication usually

21
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.550 
this is like a rule if something
holds then something else will be.

22
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.000 
And we have the equivalence relation
which means somehow if and only if

23
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.890 
then something will be.

24
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.000 
You see here the list of logical
connectives they are here listed

25
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.420 
in a set which is called Op or
op and then we have a set

26
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.550 
of symbols which then stand for our basic
assumptions and basic statements.

27
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.350 
However the intersection of course
of the set of logical connectives

28
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.390 
and the set of symbols that we use should
be empty. So they should be disjoint.

29
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.270 
And of course we have truth values,
so an assumption can be either true

30
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.350 
or false. So there is no
other third possibility.

31
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.110 
Then if it comes to you know
creating sentences these

32
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.140 
are propositions in that sense we
need some kind of production rules.

33
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.480 
So first of all we can say that
all atomic formulas that means

34
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.950 
all elements of our basic
set of symbols sigma

35
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.930 
they are propositions.

36
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.760 
Then let's come to the connectives
that we have. If Φ is a proposition

37
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.860 
then also the negation of Φ. So not
Φ is then also a proposition.

38
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.890 
And this also holds for all the
other propositions. So if Φ

39
00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.290 
and Ψ are propositions then
also Φ and Ψ like Φ or Ψ

40
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.820 
like if Φ then Ψ and also of
course the equivalence relation.

41
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.000 
So this somehow tells us the syntax
of propositional logic and how

42
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.770 
propositions can be formed and
are well-formed in the end. And

43
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.880 
there is a priority of these
connectives which means first

44
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.050 
comes always or is always evaluated
the negation then comes

45
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.840 
the conjunction then disjunction
and then comes implication and

46
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.420 
equivalence. So much
for the syntax.

47
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.960 
Let's have a look how modelling there
is really made. So for example

48
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.980 
the simple assertion the moon is made
of green cheese would be modelled as

49
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.350 
you know here a
simple symbol g.

50
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.690 
Of course g in that sense is not
rather expressive. That's the

51
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.310 
drawback of
propositional logic.

52
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.200 
Another simple assertion that
rains would be r the street

53
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.150 
is getting red would be n. And now
you can compose these assertions

54
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.060 
to longer propositions like for
example if it rains then the

55
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.450 
street will get wet, that would
be r implies n or if it rains

56
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.950 
and the street does not get wet
then the moon is made of green

57
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.810 
cheese. So you would
have something like

58
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.280 
r and not n implies g if of
course g is the assertion for

59
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.070 
the moon is made
of green cheese.

60
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.660 
You see it's as simple as that so this
is the way how propositional logic

61
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.450 
works. The question now is what is
its interpretation, what's the

62
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.950 
meaning what's the model theoretical
semantics of propositional logic?

63
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.070 
This we do by a so called
interpretation function i and this

64
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.220 
interpretation first of all maps
all atomic propositions that

65
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.890 
we have either to true or false. So
the interpretation maps everything

66
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.530 
to our truth values.
How does it do it?

67
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.660 
Of course we have this already
for the atomic propositions

68
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.870 
this is our outline. So an atomic
proposition is either true or false

69
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.240 
and then if you have a formula and
you say if f is a formula and

70
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.960 
i is an interpretation then the
interpretation of that formula

71
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.300 
is a truth value that is computed
from of course the formula

72
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.960 
and the interpretation via truth
tables. And you all have seen

73
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.470 
truth tables back in school. So
this is for example the truth

74
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.910 
table where you see how the
interpretation of simple propositions

75
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.840 
and then formulas in the end can
be developed by a truth table.

76
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.900 
So you have here in the first two
columns the interpretation of two

77
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.240 
atomic propositions p and q and they are
either false or true which means we

78
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.000 
look first on the combination
false false and false true true

79
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.590 
false and true true.
You see it then

80
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.160 
the interpretation of all subsequent
formulas here for example

81
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.310 
the interpretation of not p and you
see whenever the interpretation

82
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.180 
of p is false then the
interpretation of not p is true.

83
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.540 
Then you have the disjunction then you
have the conjunction the implication

84
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.080 
and the equivalent. You all have
seen this already probably

85
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
not with true and false but with
zero and one but this is the

86
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.360 
way how you know you interpret
the propositional logic and

87
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.750 
how you determine the explicit
semantics of a formula like that.

88
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.020 
So this is how we are come up
with the semantics and then of

89
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.220 
course if we have the semantics
of propositional logic we can

90
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.930 
do computations we can do entailment
and everything else. So this is

91
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.560 
exactly what we are
going to do. So

92
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.510 
talking about
entailment.

93
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.150 
We will write that an
interpretation i

94
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.200 
entails a formula f exactly then
if the interpretation of the

95
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.960 
formula f is true. This means we
call and this interpretation i

96
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
a model of the
formula f.

97
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.760 
And then there comes the rules of
semantics that say that i is a model

98
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:03.470 
of not Φ exactly if and only
if i is not a model of Φ.

99
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.950 
So that would be a rule telling you
what to do in the case of exactly

100
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.210 
negation. You do
the same then for

101
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.230 
conjunction disjunction and so
on. So i is a model of Φ and Ψ

102
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.050 
if and only if i is a model
of Φ and Ψ and so on.

103
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.100 
So with this junction it would
be or with a implication you

104
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.160 
would have the implication function
and with equivalence you

105
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.490 
would have the
equivalence function.

106
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.520 
And then of course you have some
basic concepts to consider

107
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.110 
not only in propositional logic. So
there are so called tautologies

108
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.450 
which means under all interpretation this
formula is true, this is a tautology.

109
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:53.600 
You say a formula is satisfiable if there
exists a specific interpretation under which

110
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.700 
this is true. So the formula
is true then it satisfiable.

111
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:06.170 
Vice versa a formula is refutable if and
only if there exists an interpretation

112
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.620 
under which of course
it computes to false.

113
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.720 
And in the end unsatisfiability that's
the opposite concept to tautology.

114
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.600 
It's a contradiction and this means
under all possible interpretation

115
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.030 
this formula is false
or computes false.

116
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.120 
So these four concepts we will
also consider in the future.

117
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.720 
But what else do you have to know
about propositional logic?

118
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.910 
First of all it's decidable. That's
from complexity theory. It means that

119
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.910 
all true entailment can be
found as well as all false

120
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.370 
entailment can be found of course as long
as you spend enough time for that.

121
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000 
This means on the other hand that
of course if you are trying to

122
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.940 
let a theory improver this is a computer
program doing reasoning over these formulas

123
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.900 
if you use a theory improver it will
always terminate at some point.

124
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.840 
Of course it might take a long time but
it's clear that it will terminate.

125
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.190 
Otherwise it would be undecidable.
So more complex logics like

126
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.630 
for example first order logic
they are often most times

127
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.240 
always sorry undecidable. And we
have in between then specific

128
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.480 
description logics we will see
that in the next excursion. And

129
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.350 
description logics usually
are also decidable.

130
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.430 
Ok another useful property that
we might get use of is for

131
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.680 
example this one. So if we have
the following assumption here

132
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.910 
so we say Φ1, Φ2 to Φn
entails another proposition

133
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:51.390 
Φ. If this holds or this holds exactly
only if and only if you know

134
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:57.070 
the conjunction of all of these
propositions implies that Φ

135
00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.650 
is a tautology which means this
holds under all interpretations.

136
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.850 
And this is an interesting you know relation
that connects semantic entailment

137
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.340 
with syntactic entailment. So the lower
line here is syntactic entailment.

138
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.390 
Yes you know this from the truth table so
it simply here with a logical connectives

139
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.920 
and the upper line of course is
semantic entailment because

140
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.440 
you have here as set of proposition
which entails another proposition.

141
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.190 
So this is an interesting connection
that you have to use to

142
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.330 
to really then do computations and
to implement your improvers based

143
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.920 
on exactly the semantics and the model
theoretic semantics of that logic.

144
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.630 
The decision that in the end if for
example some assertion is a tautology

145
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:51.770 
can be made via truth tables and
this is ensured exactly by this

146
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.310 
relation that you have here that
connects the semantic entailment

147
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.750 
with the syntactic entailment that is
bound or coupled to the truth tables.

148
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.980 
And in principle this equals the evaluation
of all possible interpretations that you

149
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.340 
can possibly think of.
In propositional logic

150
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.480 
this works well. In first
order logic there might be

151
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.090 
an infinite number of
interpretations which in the end

152
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.860 
yeah are responsible that first order
logic is not decidable anymore.

153
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.470 
Speaking about first order logic
let's have a look at that.

154
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.540 
So what's the difference between
propositional logic and first order logic?

155
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.480 
In first order logic besides of
course we also have operators

156
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.270 
we also have a basic assumptions and
basic proposition and stuff like that

157
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.780 
however we have two additional
functional elements and these

158
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.170 
are the so called quantifiers. We
have an existential quantifier

159
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:55.470 
and a universal quantifier and the
most important thing is that here

160
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:01.160 
with the help of these quantifiers
I will be able to do or to make

161
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.780 
statements about sets of things
so I don't have to do the same

162
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.860 
statement for all of the things I
want to do the statements of;

163
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.850 
I can summarize
them. For

164
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.550 
the extension quantification I
can say that something exists

165
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.450 
and for the universal
quantifier I can say for all

166
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.850 
things that have a specific quality
or that belong to a specific

167
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.070 
class or whatever for all I'm
talking about for all a variable

168
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.660 
to this exactly hold. So you have
a universal quantifier and

169
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.520 
existential quantifier for making a
propositions and assumptions about sets.

170
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.040 
This is the main and most
important difference.

171
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.860 
Then it's also a bit more let's say
sophisticated in the sense that

172
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.600 
you distinguish between the operators.
So the logical connectives

173
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.320 
that we already have in propositional
logic. Then we have variables of course.

174
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.500 
Here usually to distinguish them
from constants and functions

175
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.910 
we write them in
capital letters.

176
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.720 
Then we have a set of constants
so these are usually named

177
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.950 
objects from our domain of discourse we
are talking about, they are constants.

178
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.750 
And then we have functions. And
of course besides functions

179
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.800 
we also have relations which are
more general and predicates.

180
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.550 
Ok and here you see the example
of a first order logic formula.

181
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.570 
So for example this means for all
variables x and all variables y

182
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:36.990 
it holds that if p of x or not q
of f of x and y then r of x.

183
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.250 
Sounds a bit odd but this exactly
is the formula here. Now of

184
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.450 
course if you know exactly
what x and y stands for

185
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.680 
then probably and also if you know
what the the predicate you have here

186
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.700 
the functions would
mean so f q and p,

187
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.010 
then you would have an idea what
exactly this formula means.

188
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.900 
So what we need for that is of course
also we need interpretation.

189
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.630 
But before we come to the interpretation
let's first have a look

190
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.270 
at a formula at the syntax of
the formulas, how do I create

191
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.830 
a formula in first order logic.
We start there at the basic

192
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.980 
line. So first we have to formulate
so called terms and we do

193
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.300 
formulate terms from variables from
constants and from functions.

194
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.840 
So all combinations of variables
constants and functions these

195
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.060 
are terms these are the basic elements
in first order logic as you see here.

196
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.770 
What I do next is I try to formulate
atoms or atomic formulas

197
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.410 
and there I combine predicates
with terms as arguments. So

198
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.550 
now I have predicates you see them
in blue combined with a red terms.

199
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:50.710 
And of course they do not necessarily always
have to be a single let's say character.

200
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.190 
they can also be self speaking
like you see here you have um

201
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.750 
a predicate greater than and this is
applied to a function x location

202
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.190 
which is applied to a variable
which is named pixel and you

203
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.610 
have a constant one hundred twenty
eight. So this would be a correct

204
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.230 
formulated atomic formula
in first order logic.

205
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.670 
And then we come to full fledged
formulas from atomic formulas

206
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:23.290 
by applying operators and by applying
quantifiers. So you have here something

207
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.490 
like for example for all pixel
it holds if you know the ex

208
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.220 
location of a pixel is greater
than one hundred and twenty

209
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.090 
eight this pixel
should be read.

210
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:39.440 
So you see creating formulas
in first order logic is not

211
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.160 
so complicated at all. So this of
course you have to implement

212
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.510 
if you try to come up with a power
that powers is first order

213
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.110 
logic and this is the syntax
of first-order logic.

214
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.040 
This of course is not complete.
However if in doubt what comes

215
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.970 
first what comes next you should
use brackets if you formulate

216
00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.230 
these kind of formulas and all
variables in first order logic

217
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.550 
usually should be
quantified in some sense.

218
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.590 
Ok now let's see how we model
simple facts in first order logic

219
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.400 
before we come to the
interpretation.

220
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.400 
First let's try with this one -
all kids love ice cream. So this

221
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.870 
means for all variables x where
it holds that x is a child

222
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.180 
then or this implies that
x also loves ice cream

223
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.020 
or the father of a person
is its male parent.

224
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.500 
For all variables x and y it holds
if x is the father of y this

225
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.760 
is equivalent to or this
holds only if and only

226
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.710 
x is male and x is
the parent of y.

227
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.380 
So this is also
another formula.

228
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.810 
Another thing here there are one
or more interesting lectures

229
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.380 
which means there exist interesting
lectures and I hope of

230
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.780 
course that this lecture also
belongs to that class.

231
00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:02.440 
So there exists a variable x for which
it holds that x is a lecture and x

232
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.550 
is interesting.

233
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.720 
Or the relation is neighbor is
symmetric this means for all

234
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.810 
x and all y it
holds that if

235
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.960 
x is the neighbor of y then it also
holds that y is the neighbor

236
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.120 
of x which means this

237
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.920 
function or a predicate
definitely is symmetric.

238
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:31.830 
We will look at these two things. So
if we use universal quantification

239
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.990 
and if we use existential
quantification especially for the

240
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.880 
thing when we say there are
interesting lecture so the

241
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.850 
exist interesting lectures or
all lectures are interesting

242
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:46.190 
this makes a difference and you see
here once we use the implication

243
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.360 
and once we use here
the conjunction.

244
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.400 
And this is important and it
really makes a difference. I can

245
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.370 
show you here. So how do I model s
thicorrectly? If I want to model

246
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.830 
all kids love ice cream I have
to use the implication what

247
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.130 
does that mean? You can see this
from the truth table that of

248
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.590 
course if I use instead
of the implication here

249
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.780 
a conjunction we do have another
result in the truth table.

250
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.370 
However if I try to read this it
reads more or less a natural

251
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.220 
language the same. So here ambiguity
of natural language we have to take

252
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.630 
really really care of. So what does
the first one the red one mean?

253
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.930 
It means that it is possible that
x is not a kid but nevertheless

254
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.940 
loves ice cream. So we have you
know for the first part of the

255
00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.570 
formula this computes to zero. So
x is not that child and loves

256
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.020 
ice cream is one nevertheless
the result of that is true. So

257
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.820 
it can be that you know somebody
else loves ice cream.

258
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.450 
And this of course is true while
we are saying all kids love

259
00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.170 
ice cream this does not mean
that there is nobody else who

260
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.410 
might love ice cream.

261
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.900 
Therefore what I have to do here of course
is if you look at the truth table

262
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.050 
exactly for the situation if the
first column is zero and the

263
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.950 
second column is one also this
computes to one because

264
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.120 
it's possible all kids love ice
cream does not mean that nobody

265
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.260 
else loves ice cream.

266
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.990 
On the other hand if I would connect this
here with a conjunction I would have

267
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:18.610 
the assumption or the statement
that there are only

268
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.760 
kids in the universe we are talking
about and they love ice cream.

269
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.340 
You see this in the truth table.
So this is the last row. So

270
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.360 
if x you know if a child of x is
one and love ice cream of x

271
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.210 
is also one then and only then of course
this second formula computes to true.

272
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.550 
And of course if we want to
say all kids love ice cream

273
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.210 
we have in mind that of course
besides kids also other people

274
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.330 
might love ice cream. But we don't
exclude that. So therefore be careful

275
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.690 
which logical connective
you choose.

276
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.140 
You see this also if you take or
take a look on the other side

277
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.530 
if we use the existential
quantification.

278
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.420 
So for the case there are one
or more interesting lectures

279
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.690 
there we have to take the conjunction.
What would happen if we don't

280
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.420 
use the conjunction
but the implication?

281
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.820 
So for example first look at the
implication, the red line.

282
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.080 
There exists x and of course if x is
a lecture then x is interesting,

283
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.690 
which means here x is also
qualified if x is not a lecture

284
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.780 
which means of course there
might be other things you know

285
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.240 
x is not a lecture however
it is interesting.

286
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.380 
This would not be
equivalent to

287
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.200 
the original natural language
assumption that we want to model

288
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.150 
where we say there are interesting
lectures, because if you let's say

289
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.620 
x s ice cream and ice cream
is interesting yeah this is

290
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.330 
interesting but this does have
nothing to do with exactly here

291
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.120 
our assumption that there are
interesting lectures. Therefore

292
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.580 
there it's really really important
that you choose the first

293
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.340 
version the blue one which means
we only address here these

294
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.940 
things which have both properties
fulfilled. So x must be a

295
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.590 
lecture and x must be interesting
and there is of course an

296
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:17.500 
x somewhere out there for which
this exactly holds. This means

297
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.100 
existential quantification and
these two differences you have

298
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.510 
to keep in mind because it's
important for modelling and also

299
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.420 
then later on for description
logics and modeling facts in

300
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.520 
OWL. So this is an
essential fact.

301
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.470 
But now let's look
deeper into semantics.

302
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.000 
So the structure of course first
what we have to do is we have

303
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.830 
to find a domain of interest that
we want to meddle and on and with

304
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.950 
within this domain first then we
come up with constant symbols

305
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.420 
and with function symbols and
relations symbols and all of them

306
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.670 
have to be mapped to some elements
we have in our domain D.

307
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.360 
So this then in the end will be
some kind of interpretation

308
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:06.320 
that we are using. Then all the terms
that we create over these basic symbols

309
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.570 
they will also become
elements of D.

310
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.840 
Relations symbols with arguments
again then in the end will

311
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.100 
become true or false and the logical
collectives and quantifiers

312
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:23.660 
are treated exactly in the same way.
So this is how the interpretation of

313
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.900 
a first order logic formula
works. But we have to look

314
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.570 
at this in detail and i will show
you this on a small example

315
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:36.880 
on the so called infamous penguin
example that most students of logic

316
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:43.140 
really know. So imagine there is a penguin
and we have the following statement

317
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.880 
coming from the
penguin: he says

318
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.120 
penguins are black and
white of course.

319
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.170 
Some old tv shows are black and white.
Of course we all remember that.

320
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.160 
Therefore some penguins
are old tv shows.

321
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.210 
Is this a valid
statement?

322
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:06.020 
Is this always true? Yeah you
see logic is another thing

323
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.720 
which or that penguins are
not very good at. However

324
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.260 
we have to prove that this of
course does not always hold which

325
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.780 
means we have to prove that this as a
formula is refutable. There exists

326
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.590 
an interpretation for which this
computes false. If we show

327
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.920 
that then we see it's refutable
then it's not a tautology and

328
00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.020 
we are done and ww
say yeah penguin

329
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.450 
you're not right
you're wrong.

330
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.620 
Ok so let's have
a look at that.

331
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:41.350 
I try here to translate exactly
the natural language formula to

332
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.000 
a first order logic formula and
you see this is straightforward.

333
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.860 
So for all variable x it holds
that if x is a penguin then

334
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.830 
x is black and white which means
all blue penguins are black

335
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.120 
and white. We know this already
from our first discussion about

336
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.010 
universal and existential
quantification.

337
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.830 
Next fact that holds so I connect
this with a conjunction.

338
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:10.120 
There exists an x where x is an
old tv show and x is black

339
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.790 
and white. So this means some old
tv shows are black and white.

340
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.380 
There exists an old tv show which
might be black and white.

341
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.850 
And this so therefore
means this implies

342
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.530 
that there exists
a penguin

343
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.780 
who or that is an
old tv show.

344
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:34.480 
Yeah so coming back to the formula what
exactly is its intentional semantics.

345
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.130 
Well for that we do or try to
find interpretations. So we try

346
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:45.450 
to come up with a domain. So we
say ok we have a set M and this

347
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.250 
set M contains two elements a
and b because we are talking

348
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:54.770 
here about two variables x and y. You
know no it's only one variable.

349
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.260 
No matter. So it's only one variable
but we have three different

350
00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.920 
formulas but we want to talk
about two different things so

351
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.500 
we might have tv shows we might
have penguins so we choose two

352
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.090 
elements in our domain
of interpretation.

353
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.480 
We don't have any constants so
far we don't have any function

354
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.340 
symbols so far. That's nice. What
we want to show is the formula

355
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.400 
is refutable which means its on
tautology, it does not hold

356
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.560 
under every circumstances under
every interpretation. There

357
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.510 
is an interpretation under
which this formula is wrong.

358
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.990 
And this exactly is the
interpretation we choose. So we say

359
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:37.430 
a it's a penguin should be true, a is
black and white the interpretation

360
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.760 
of that should be true,

361
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.450 
b it's an old tv show
should also be true,

362
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.230 
b is black and white should also
be true. So this is the first

363
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.010 
part so the first two lines here
of the formula. We say the

364
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.820 
interpretation of these
things is true.

365
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.580 
However then if we then
say old tv show of a

366
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:04.600 
is false and we put this then
here in the the last line

367
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.500 
of the formula, this would
mean that of course

368
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.710 
the beginning we want to model
which computes to true

369
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.940 
implies something which is in
the end wrong which is false.

370
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:21.840 
Therefore the entire interpretation
of the formula would become

371
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.620 
false. So under exactly

372
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.300 
this assignment or
this interpretation

373
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.160 
a is a penguin is true, a is black
and white is true, b is an

374
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.310 
old tv show is true, b is black and
white is true, but a is not an

375
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.550 
old tv show so a penguin is not
an old tv show its false.

376
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:48.570 
Then the formula computes to false and
then it's refutable we have shown

377
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.300 
that this it's not
a tautology.

378
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.670 
So then the formula with the
interpretation i is false. This means

379
00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.460 
i does not entail the formula.
So there is no interpretation

380
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.880 
or this interpretation exactly
does not entail the formula

381
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.670 
and its not a model
for the formula.

382
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:14.350 
This exactly we wanted to show so you see this
is how interpretation especially the model

383
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.640 
theoretic
semantics works.

384
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.310 
Then of course since we are talking
not only about one formula

385
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:26.270 
but about sets of formulas we have here
these kind of quantifiers we of course

386
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.140 
have to extend a bit our logical
entailment so we say a theory

387
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.640 
t simply is a set of formulas
we are talking about and then

388
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.950 
also an interpretation i is a model
of t of a theory if and only if

389
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:46.220 
this interpretation entails
g for all formulas g in t.

390
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.040 
So only then
of course if

391
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.230 
i is a model for all
of the formulas

392
00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:00.130 
in our theory t then also i
is a model of the theory t.

393
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.800 
Another thing is that a formula
f is a logical consequence

394
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:10.240 
of our theory t if all models of t are
also a model of f. And then we write

395
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.750 
the theory entails
the formula f.

396
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.350 
The last thing that is missing
is the equivalence relations

397
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.020 
of two formulas f and g are called
logically equivalent. Exactly then

398
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:31.660 
if f entails g and if g entails f
then we write f is equivalent to g.

399
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.790 
And on the other hand so if we
are talking about theories here

400
00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:40.610 
this means with a set of formulas
this is the same as you know

401
00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.650 
a knowledge base where you also have
in the terminological knowledge

402
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.920 
as set of formulas and this are
theories. So this terminological

403
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.040 
knowledge we are talking about
can be interpreted based on

404
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.750 
a logic in exactly
this way.

405
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.030 
So this was all about propositional
and first order logic but

406
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:06.340 
this was only a preliminary because
for knowledge representation

407
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.540 
you might have already realised
that propositional logic is

408
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.830 
of course completely insufficient
because it's way too coarse

409
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.080 
and first order logic on the other
hand is really complicated

410
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.200 
and undecidable
since we are

411
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.100 
it's possible of course if you talk
about domains with an infinite

412
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.410 
number of elements
that of course then

413
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.610 
all computations that you try to
do with the theory improver

414
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.220 
won't come ever
to an end.

415
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.250 
Therefore there are description
logics. They are somehow in between

416
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.930 
and they are well suited for
knowledge representation in our

417
00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.970 
purposes and this of course will be
the subject of the next excursion.

1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.490 
We now have a closer look
at human factors in our

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.850 
openHPI course about Cyber
threats by Malware.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.420 
We already discussed that technical
failures make it possible

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.840 
that malware, that
cybercriminals

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.010 
find the possibilities to install
malware on computer systems

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.380 
of their victims but

7
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.420 
the same risk is provided by the user
of that system. So the Human factor -

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.900 
it stands for all human aspects
that could create security risks

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
in a computer system.

10
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.010 
We can distinguish two categories
of such human factor -

11
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.420 
one is active risk - that is
risk that's caused unknowningly

12
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.760 
or knowingly by doing
a certain activity,

13
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.490 
or passive - the category of passive
risk that is caused by not doing

14
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.820 
a certain activity that
should have been done.

15
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.340 
Often this human factor is
called social engineering.

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
And social engineering - these are social
hacking attacks. Here the attacker

17
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.670 
tries to impersonate other people
or systems (website or application)

18
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.300 
to trick the users to share secret
personal information or to do something

19
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470 
which helps them to get
their malware installed.

20
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.550 
Here are some examples. For
example, user gets a phone call

21
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.880 
from an unknown
number. The attacker

22
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.470 
tells that he is an employee
from the user's bank

23
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.210 
and needs his help to check for
potentially fraud bank transfer.

24
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.990 
The user gets in a stress situation -
oh, my bank account was hacked!

25
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.240 
What happened with my money? So, by
means of this message, a certain

26
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.930 
pressure is put to the
user and in that

27
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.620 
situation the attacker says - I will help
you, I will support you, I will

28
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.660 
take care that nothing serious
happens but to do this I need your

29
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.940 
private bank
account details.

30
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.810 
For example to verify
the fake transfer.

31
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.320 
The attacker, when the user is
willing to share this data, then

32
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.160 
the attacker can use the data to
maliciously authenticate himself

33
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
with the bank and then
do the real attack.

34
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.830 
You see the social engineering
misuses weaknesses of humans,

35
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
designs stress
situations,

36
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.700 
tries to receive trust for something
which the user would not do

37
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.560 
without such an

38
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.320 
situation which
is created by the

39
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.020 
attacker. Let's have a look
at some human factors

40
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.070 
which are active human
factors - so email phishing.

41
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.250 
Email phishing, we already discussed
here - the attackers try to send emails

42
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.150 
with a malicious
attachment.

43
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.670 
A malicious attachment means an attachment,
for example a letter or an image,

44
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.820 
and inside this letter or
inside this image malware is hidden.

45
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.830 
The attachment containing this email,
if the user opens this attachment

46
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.930 
then automatically the
malware is installed.

47
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.450 
So here it is up to
the user to be aware

48
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.530 
of the threat. So, attachment from
a source you are not knowing

49
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.870 
you should not simply open but
it could contain malware and

50
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.970 
then this malware is installed on
your computer, on your system.

51
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.190 
In most cases you are not aware
that there is a malware and it

52
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.090 
is installed because this
malware starts to do

53
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.880 
attack work late on.

54
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.420 
If an email is not expected or if an
email comes from an unknown person,

55
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.470 
do not open the attachment. Do not open
the attachment because it could be a way

56
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.450 
to install malware
on your computer.

57
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.490 
If an email appears to
be from an colleague

58
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.830 
but sounds suspicious,

59
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.190 
ask a colleague through a
different channel, for example by

60
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.700 
phone or an SMS whether this email,
whether this information really comes

61
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.740 
from them. Another active factor
allows spear phishing attacks.

62
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.610 
We already discussed
about phishing attacks.

63
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.410 
So the traditional phishing
attacks are widespread

64
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.690 
and they are no more effective
because many people heard in the media

65
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.980 
that one should be careful - if one
gets an email from the bank

66
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.050 
which says we want to do
some installation, please

67
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.240 
log in. So the attacker
in this spear phishing,

68
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.910 
they turn to a personalized
attack to the personalized

69
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.840 
phishing or spear
phishing attack.

70
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.420 
Tthe idea behind this is the attacker collects
highly detailed personal information.

71
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.790 
Personal
information about

72
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:14.470 
his victim which later on he is using
for gaining trust of that person.

73
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.090 
So the attacker collects references
of a person, for example

74
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.480 
from friends, family
members, colleagues -

75
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.860 
who know the victim and later on
when they formulate their phishing

76
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.650 
mail or the phishing attack,
they use this information

77
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:43.650 
and the victim starts to believe
that this email comes really from a

78
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.570 
family member or from a colleague
because so much information

79
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.940 
no one else could know. What
the victim is forgetting

80
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.500 
that such information are public in
social media or in a web presence and

81
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.950 
so the attacker with the spear phishing
attack have a good success rate.

82
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.960 
So spear phishing have a much
higher success probability

83
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:21.120 
then the requirement, the sending of
a traditional phishing but

84
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.390 
they require much more
work from the attacker.

85
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.190 
So typically such
personalised phishing

86
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:34.170 
is very dangerous and is
sent to important persons,

87
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.020 
for example to a CEO of a
company, to a politician,

88
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.710 
to a high ranked
official, to an

89
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.030 
army general or others.

90
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.330 
To people working in sensitive sectors,
for example in military, in business

91
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.630 
in financial,
in politics.

92
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.620 
So the attacker could
be launched by states,

93
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.540 
activists, hackers or organised crime
which have enough resources

94
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.450 
to prepare such spear
phishing attacks.

95
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.880 
A remark - many other attacks on the
internet are starting with

96
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.120 
such personalised phishing attack, starts
with such spear phishing attacks

97
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.700 
as a first step to get credentials, to
step into a system and then to continue

98
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.290 
with other things. If we look
at passive human factors

99
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.320 
then we have to mention that even when a
company is providing good security guidelines,

100
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.130 
if the user, if the employees are
not following these guidelines,

101
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.500 
then the attacker can attack
the system of the company

102
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.390 
even on a way

103
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.710 
that the security
guidelines

104
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.420 
would not allow. So there may be
employees who simply do not care

105
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:12.020 
or do not follow such guidelines
in general and in particular

106
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.670 
such security
guidelines.

107
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.190 
So they fail to adhere to the
guidelines, to the standards

108
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:26.260 
and this could cause serious security
problems because they are not

109
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.590 
doing what they are
expected to do.

110
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.330 
And if the attacker
finds one employee

111
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.990 
behaving in such a

112
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.250 
lazy way or in such a way
and not following the

113
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:49.400 
regulation, then the attacker can succeed
with his attack and can be able

114
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.160 
to install malware in the
system of the company. So in

115
00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:02.490 
the company what they have to do is to
provide dedicated information to the

116
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.570 
people, to sensibilize the
employees for the topic of security,

117
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:15.060 
for the topic of cybersecurity
and a depiction of results

118
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:21.070 
of lack of caution. Our course also
should provide such an awareness

119
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.660 
for these kinds
of attacks.

120
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:32.140 
In general, the weakest link in the security
chain is often the human being.

121
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.870 
He behaves lazy, behaves
uninformed or

122
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.390 
is doing obstructive
work or others. This

123
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.860 
make it dangerous. This is a very
complex system and in this chain

124
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:57.240 
all elements
have to follow the rules.

125
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.840 
So the human factor is
really a decisive one

126
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.350 
if we consider cyberthreats in
general and cyberthreats by

127
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.740 
malware in detail.

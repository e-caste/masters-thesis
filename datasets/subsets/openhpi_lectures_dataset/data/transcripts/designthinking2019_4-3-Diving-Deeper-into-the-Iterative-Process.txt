1
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.640 
So let's now altogether dive deeper

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.080 
into all the six steps off
our Design Thinking process.

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.320 
So it is not applying Design Thinking

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.520 
as a mindset to design purposefully
solutions for wicked problems.

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.040 
You'll have to start with that question,

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.240 
the design challenge,

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.720 
and then within your team to gain

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.120 
a actually common understanding of the
problem. That means together unpack

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.560 
what are your underlying concepts

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.360 
about the important dimensions
that are put into that challenge?

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.840 
Plus, it's also about doing a little bit
of desk research,

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.840 
trying to figure out what information is
already existing about this problem,

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.520 
and then it's about putting
it all together in your team.

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.160 
So trying to also use process maps as

15
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.200 
tools in order to describe the situation
of persons and use stakeholder maps

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.440 
in order to map out the actors that are
also involved in actually creating

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.120 
that problem space and being actors later
on, also to implement the solution.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.640 
And this putting all together needs
actually to a systems map where you then

19
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.320 
have a thorough understanding
of the problem.

20
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.320 
Once you start applying design thinking as
a mindset to a problem,

21
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.080 
you typically start using the design
thinking process and its six step logic.

22
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.680 
And we'd like to walk you through one
on one through those steps very quickly.

23
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.520 
Once you start with your design thinking

24
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.440 
team working on your challenge
in the first step and stage,

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.880 
it's about gaining a common understanding
about the problem and its underlying

26
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.200 
concepts and also understanding
the users in context.

27
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.120 
This prepares you for going out there
to actually literally talk to people,

28
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.960 
but also meet them and observe
them in their environment.

29
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.080 
It's about listening to what they say, but
also watching and observing what they do.Then

30
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.360 
what you have seen and heard

31
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.480 
in the field, you then start to converge
in terms of putting together and bringing

32
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.240 
together the inspirations and the insights
you have gained into your point of view.

33
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.480 
That's actually your reframed challenge
perspective, that you as a team want

34
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.040 
to take on from the problem space
into finding solutions later.

35
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.240 
So the team has now generated

36
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.280 
a very precise point of view, a very
clear picture of where to move next.

37
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.760 
And then we open up the minds
of the people and the team is generating

38
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.080 
lots of ideas,
rather a thousands, than ten.

39
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.840 
And then the team also selects the best

40
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.400 
of them and tries to cluster them,
brings them together.

41
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.480 
Now, the team has several ideas selected,
and we ask them to focus on one or two

42
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.720 
of them and actually build it to try
to make it visible,

43
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.120 
make it touchable and make it something
for handing over to a possible customer.

44
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.120 
Now, the team got the prototype

45
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.720 
and next step is to go out for testing
to move towards the people we are trying

46
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.680 
to address and to find out
and to gain insights.

47
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.160 
Is it really the right
object, the right product?

48
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440 
The right service?
We are trying to offer them.

49
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.520 
We went through all the six steps very
fast and we ask our students to do this

50
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.920 
sometimes in just one day to run
through the whole process.

51
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.240 
And this is actually what
what we have learned now.

52
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.760 
This is how every piece
of software is developed.

53
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.680 
This is how every designer works

54
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.760 
intuitively and every
architect works intuitively.

55
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.240 
And this is what a lot of people
think is design thinking.

56
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.960 
However.

57
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.480 
For us, design thinking is actually more.

58
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.240 
It's not just a fast forward,

59
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.040 
a run through one's
for a process in a few days.

60
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.120 
That's something we always start with.

61
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.480 
But if you really want to purposefully
design innovations and new products,

62
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.760 
new services, new offers, even business
designs we have to allow us more time.

63
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600 
And we have to plan accordingly.

64
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.920 
And we also have to plan
different innovative loops.

65
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.440 
This means, for example,

66
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.800 
once you have done this first discovery
mode, fastforward design thinking,

67
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.040 
now it's really about
designing something more.

68
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.000 
And that means also going deeper

69
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.640 
and allowing yourself and your team
more time on these specific phases,

70
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.760 
and also more time on the iterations.

71
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.240 
So, for example, we have been starting with

72
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.560 
the "Understand" and this is
gaining a common understanding and team.

73
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.200 
If you really set up
a design thinking project,

74
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.240 
this is also about really understanding
what's out there, what kind of information

75
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.400 
are accessible,
how can we use them within our project?

76
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.320 
What kind of trends and scenarios are
existing that we can build into it?

77
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.680 
And besides just looking at the human
being for whom we're designing for,

78
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.920 
we also want to look
at the existing environment.

79
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.360 
Who are the stakeholders?

80
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.880 
What's the system behind?

81
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.520 
And how can we actually merge all of this
information in a common but also more well

82
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.920 
informed understanding of our
challenge and the underlying problem.

83
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.200 
And for the second step, "Observe" it
actually also means going deeper.

84
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.600 
Allow yourself more time for doing

85
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.200 
participatory observation,
really spending time with your users.

86
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.800 
If you're about to redesign the production

87
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000 
line and the experience of workers,
there, be therefore at least one day,

88
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.080 
two days or even more time in order to
really understand what's happening there.

89
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.120 
Plus also immerse yourself
into other contexts.

90
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.800 
What about extreme users?

91
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.960 
What are people that you would
consider as being outliers?

92
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.320 
So also grasp these kind of inspirations
from other sources in order to enrich also

93
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.840 
your understanding and your
framing of the problem space.

94
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.360 
And this also makes the define the point
of view more crucial,

95
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.000 
but also more challenging,
because it's not just the amount

96
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.680 
of information that you have to handle
is becoming bigger,

97
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.520 
but it's also about the conflicting
and contradicting insights that you have

98
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.360 
gained that you are about to put together
in synthesis, where it's about creating

99
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.160 
meanings, but also merging these findings
into a picture that helps you to better

100
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.160 
understand a user in context
of his surrounding system.

101
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.640 
So "Definition of the point of view"
is really a crucial moment.

102
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.840 
And that's why it takes a lot of time
and effort to come up with that,

103
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.800 
because we're we were opening
up at the first phases.

104
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.080 
We were kind of diverging.

105
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.920 
And then we are now converging again,
trying to be very precise.

106
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.000 
And through all the time,

107
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.480 
we kind of switch off our solution
engine and the brain is what we ask.

108
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.760 
Our teams also would not think of any

109
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.520 
solution at the very first
fist moments.

110
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.120 
But then now the "Ideation" phase starts.

111
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.360 
And this is the moment where we
actually switch on the solution engine.

112
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.080 
And this is where the diversity

113
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.840 
of the teams really comes in place,
because all the sudden you see ideas

114
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.040 
popping up and hundreds of ideas popping
up from very different angles,

115
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.240 
which never would appear
in a homogeneous group.

116
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.680 
And all of a team has focused
on on an idea or one of the best ideas.

117
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.520 
And the next step is now to move

118
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.760 
into "Prototyping", which means make the
whole thing visible as fast as possible.

119
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.240 
We call it "Rapid Prototyping" and we use

120
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.400 
all kinds of material to go
to the workshop and use wood and clay

121
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.080 
and metal and all kinds of things,
sometimes also VR things.

122
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.040 
And what we found out,
which is very helpful,

123
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.560 
is to involve also the user,
the potential user already in that phase

124
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.600 
to get them involved in building
the prototypes and a co-creation process.

125
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.400 
So since we have already involved the user
in the prototyping phase.

126
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.040 
So we've got already a first
round of feedback from him.

127
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.800 
But now we want to take the prototype

128
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.240 
and move it out to the real world and get
a lot of feedback from other testers,

129
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.120 
from other users to do the next step
towards a minimal viable product.

130
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.800 
But it still needs more time to actually

131
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.960 
refine a product so that it
really can get it out there.

132
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.400 
But what we want to emphasize here is

133
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.920 
that this is a different approach compared
to lean, where you actually start

134
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.280 
with build, measure, learn; in design
thinking as an innovative process

135
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.560 
you start with learn,
build, measure, learn.

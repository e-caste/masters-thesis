00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.590 
In our OpenHPI course "Digital Identities -

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.130 
Who am I in the Internet", now we want
to speak about identity management

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.830 
and see what's the task
of identity providers.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.270 
Identity management shortly called
ID management is concerned

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.520 
with all what is needed to be able
to work with digital identities.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
Remember digital identities

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.120 
which are formed from a couple of
personal data that characterizes a user

8
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.070 
in the internet.
In particular it

9
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.670 
manages the user's access rights
to network resources. If we

10
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.100 
look for the task in more details
then one task is to secure storing

11
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.230 
of digital identities to authenticate
users, to also authorize users,

12
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.140 
to provide possibilities for external
services, to access identities,

13
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.760 
and of course the establishment of
such a digital identities is part

14
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.440 
of that identity
management.

15
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.260 
The instance that performs these
tasks is called identity provider

16
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.370 
or shortly ID provider. We will discuss
that there are different models

17
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.320 
for such ID provider in
another video clip.

18
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.150 
Let's start with the creation
of a digital identity and

19
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.920 
look to the OpenHPI example.
When you first time

20
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.380 
came and connected to open HPI, you
were invited to give in this data,

21
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.180 
your name, your email address, your
password, repeated password and some

22
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.750 
information concerning the user
profile and then you register

23
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.280 
with openHPI. At that moment you are
registering to openHPI

24
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.720 
your identity, your
digital identity

25
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.600 
is created under which
you are using OpenHPI.

26
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.460 
So our online service, this data which
comes from the registration form

27
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.150 
are stored in a database, as this is your
name, your email address, your password

28
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.760 
and then our service, OpenHPI
service can assign certain rights

29
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.530 
for you to do. The rights are to
which courses you are enrolled in.

30
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.280 
So for example, there is a user
which is enrolled to course

31
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.040 
one and course two, then his digital
identity

32
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.190 
is connected with this
information which

33
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.720 
characterizes which access
rights the user has.

34
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.870 
Here in that case because all
is cost free you are invited

35
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.720 
you can enroll for any course and in
the moment you are enrolled, you

36
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.460 
have the right to access the resources
which are provided in that course.

37
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.650 
So if you want to watch a video
as a user then as the online

38
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.510 
service checks the
database, looks for the

39
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.950 
for the access rights

40
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.270 
and checks whether the user
is enrolled to that course.

41
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.680 
He wants to access a video.
Then the database answers

42
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.650 
to the online service yes, he is
enrolled or no as she is not enrolled,

43
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.570 
and then either the video
can be watched or

44
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.220 
the user is asked to
register for that course.

45
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.170 
So as this is the access and this is
the verification of the access rights

46
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.780 
which is done after the
authentication of the user.

47
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.060 
If we look to the life cycle of a digital
identity, then of course it starts

48
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.410 
with the creation of a digital identity
and creation of a digital identity

49
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.900 
that's done in the phase
of the registration

50
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.250 
to a service. And then
the authentication

51
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.560 
is a part of the life cycle of
the digital identity to check

52
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.390 
whether the claimed identity is
a valid identity. This is done

53
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.610 
in the face of the
log in to a service,

54
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.640 
and trying to access resource and
resources are offered by the service.

55
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.050 
Then there is the use of a digital identity.
So all the data that are created

56
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.500 
when using a service are assigned
to this digital identity so that

57
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.790 
in a later use of the service for
example, some couple days later

58
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.520 
all the results, when we speak about OpenHPI
all your results of the quizzes,

59
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.040 
of the homework are connected
to your digital identity.

60
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.210 
For different activities, every time
it's necessary to check the access rights

61
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.020 
to the resources
which are provided

62
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.560 
by the service and there it is checked
whether your identity is allowed to

63
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.340 
to consume these resources. Then
the updating functionalities

64
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.540 
of a digital identities are
necessary for example, someone

65
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.710 
got a new email or some other data
are checked and then the deletion

66
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.480 
of digital identities, the de-registration
is a part in this life cycle

67
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.740 
of digital identities and many of
these functionalities is done

68
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.210 
by the ID provider and by the
service. And this is how we

69
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.860 
move in the
digital world and under

70
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.810 
our digital identity.

71
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.840 
So this is the ID
management

72
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.590 
and ID provider and how it is organized
in detail we will discuss in later

73
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.830 
videos.

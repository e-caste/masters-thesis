00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.450 
Welcome to the second week of our openhpi
course "A Half Century of Internet:

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.140 
How it Works Today". In the second
week we want to concentrate us

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.650 
to see how computer
networks

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.680 
are built and
how they work.

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.190 
So the question, how can smart devices
communicate with each other?

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.480 
This is in the center of all what we
want to discuss in the coming week.

7
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.040 
First of all why we need such computer
networks? You all know that

8
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.540 
there is a huge demand
to exchange data,

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.950 
to look to a website, to follow
a discussion in the mods,

10
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.730 
in the social media, to exchange
data with our home smart home.

11
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.940 
So the smart devices, smartphones,
tablets, computers, laptops and others

12
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.690 
exchange a huge
amount of data.

13
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
The data they exchange are different.
So first of course are the user

14
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
or technically the
client data.

15
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.960 
User or client data are e-mail
messages we want to send in website,

16
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.810 
we want to see website, we want to use with
embedded resources, html, javascript,

17
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.600 
photos, audio, video, messenger,
chats, voice and video calls,

18
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.230 
social media postings, file
transfer and more and more.

19
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.930 
But also technical systems need to
exchange data. So server and systems

20
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.910 
to work correctly they
need to exchange data

21
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.080 
like status notifications, routing
information, exchange of addresses

22
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.420 
for example DNS records, encryption
keys. So a lot of log data

23
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.550 
which also need to be transferred
between an exchange between the

24
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.660 
computer systems, so to guarantee
that they work correctly.

25
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.240 
So this huge demand for
exchanging of data

26
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.640 
a way that the devices can then
data exchange with each other.

27
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.700 
So we have many smart devices and we have
then to interconnect in a network.

28
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.780 
In a network so that they
are able to exchange data.

29
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.910 
Such a computer network consists
of course in the first lane

30
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.240 
of a collection of devices
or devices of our partners

31
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.760 
with which we went
to exchange data.

32
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.690 
But we need interconnections to transfer data,
we need interconnection media like cable

33
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.300 
system or radio signals or
optical fiber and others. And

34
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's necessary to organize this common
occasions and it works perfectly,

35
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.990 
so that what is needed are
communication protocols

36
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.950 
which provide an operation system
for such computer networks.

37
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.680 
So let's take a look at how
computer networks work.

38
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.370 
Each network is characterized
by an infrastructure

39
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.660 
which is needed. So network cards
are needed, cables are needed,

40
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:49.080 
radio devices are needed to enable
our devices to interchange

41
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.590 
to transmit to that data to each
other and to receive data.

42
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.150 
Then when we consider networks we
have to look to the structure of

43
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
the data. There are very different
messages; there are videos,

44
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.790 
there are short
text messages.

45
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.890 
So for organizing efficient
computer networks

46
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.120 
we have to take our messages and
fragment them into data packets

47
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.310 
that can be transmitted over the
internet in an independent way.

48
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.620 
So you receive also package and then
he can a defragment this package

49
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.570 
construct out of this package a message
and can understand the message

50
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.750 
and can do reactions.

51
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.570 
And when we look to the data
package they need to have

52
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.080 
a structure and format

53
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.120 
that all the technical systems
are able to work with.

54
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.320 
And particularly important
are addresses.

55
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.880 
Address format that one user
can exactly address the other

56
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.380 
user and the system of the other user
who should receive that message.

57
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.450 
And then of course we
need an access control

58
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.980 
who is allowed to access the data which
are transferred over the network.

59
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.670 
How we can or can take care that
the transmission is error free

60
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.250 
and finally there are more
requirements and mechanisms.

61
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.450 
We will discuss in detail when we look
to the different types of networks.

62
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.490 
But all this is needed

63
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.300 
to let one computer
network run.

64
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.960 
And you remember the internet is a
network of different networks.

65
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.320 
So we have to
understand

66
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.820 
the different networks in
different networks technology,

67
00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.440 
then later on to see how from this different
network and network technologies

68
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.180 
the internet
is created.

69
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.280 
I already mentioned that there are many
different types of computer networks

70
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.550 
and technologies, so for example
local area networks, local area

71
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.450 
networks that connect computer in
range of several hundred metres.

72
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.480 
A famous technology network
technologies for such

73
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.870 
area for such local area
networks is Ethernet

74
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.380 
Ethernet today is most important
and most popular land technology.

75
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:44.090 
Then we have wireless networks,
WiFi or wireless LAN networks

76
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.930 
where we can use our
small devices and can

77
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:56.360 
wherever we are connect to a
network, a to an internet without

78
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.460 
any wire needed. And then of
course we need to discuss

79
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.370 
wide area networks which consist
as interconnection of different

80
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.160 
local area networks and we have to
discuss how we can transmit data

81
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.820 
over such wide area
networks when

82
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.300 
different technologies are
interconnected to form one network.

83
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.080 
So what we want to do in
the following week to

84
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.880 
have a closer look to the variety
of computer network technologies.

85
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.460 
We consider their communication
protocols and mechanisms,

86
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.890 
we have a look how routing is
organized, routing in such

87
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.080 
a network of network,

88
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.690 
and we need to knows this to
understand the internet.

89
00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:02.010 
In the internet all these different types of
networks are interconnected all together.

90
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.940 
So I wish you a lot of fun to take
part in the second week of our

91
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.310 
openhpi course "A Half
Century of Internet"

92
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.980 
to learn a lot and of course please
go to the discussion forum and

93
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.310 
interact with the other learners
to exchange your knowledge to

94
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:30.710 
ask your questions and to come
into an exchange of ideas and

95
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.900 
knowledge with
each other.

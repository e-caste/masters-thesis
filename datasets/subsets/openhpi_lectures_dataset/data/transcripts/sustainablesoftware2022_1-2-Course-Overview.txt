00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.750 
In this video I would like to give you an overview about the

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.700 
topics you will learn in our course Sustainable Software Engineering.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.070 
I will give you an overview about the course format and the

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.000 
prerequisites you should bring to successfully follow us in this course.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.360 
This course is all about the interaction between climate change and digitalisation.

6
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.460 
We are convinced that climate change is one of the biggest

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.940 
challenges for us today and the generation to come. And we understand digitalisation.

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.780 
as one of the largest megatrend that affects everyone of us

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.280 
in our private and professional life.

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.300 
In the first part of the course we will lay out why every one of

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.760 
us should care about the interaction of digitalisation and the most

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.640 
relevant greenhouse gas which is CO two.

13
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.890 
We will explain all the basic concepts in this field.

14
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.140 
Backed with this basics, will then focus on the craft of digitalisation, which is

15
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.030 
software engineering and take the perspectives of all the relevant

16
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.570 
roles in the software engineering process starting with the developer

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
using the IT architect's perspective up to the project lead of

18
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
projects in software engineering. By that we show you also examples how every role

19
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.910 
can contribute to safe co two.

20
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.520 
Many of these ideas are actually quite straightforward in theory,

21
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.490 
but not as easy to apply in practice. Therefore at the end of

22
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.810 
the first part of this course, we will have a look at the challenges

23
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.720 
that hinder us to instantly apply these ideas in practice,

24
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.230 
and we will show you solution strategies how to overcome barriers

25
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.690 
that hinder us from applying solutions for a more sustainable

26
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.910 
software engineering.

27
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.650 
Equipped with all that theory you are ready to apply it in practice.

28
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.520 
So in the second part we will show you how to do sustainable software engineering.

29
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.990 
We will use programming examples to explain how to increase efficiency

30
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.280 
and resource efficiency in all relevant aspects of computing, storage and networking.

31
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.470 
And at the end to test your own understanding, we will provide

32
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.840 
graded assignments using programming. Thus in case you want to

33
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.350 
successfully finish the full course, you will need to pass these

34
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.720 
programming exercises.

35
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.160 
As you might know the concept of sustainability is quite extensive. So we focus

36
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.500 
on how the process of sustainable software engineering could be

37
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.120 
ecologically compatible to our environment- the planet Earth.

38
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.530 
Simply put we focus on how digitalisation saves and emits co

39
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.930 
two and what we can do about it in the software engineering practice.

40
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.530 
We will not cover social aspects of sustainability in the context of digitalisation

41
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.210 
even though the discussion is very, very important too and is often

42
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.120 
if you want to look and read about it more about this topic, it's often

43
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.980 
referenced as the socio ecological transformation. Very important but

44
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.050 
it's out of scope for our course here.

45
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.370 
The format of the course-

46
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.430 
the credit assignments are at the end of every week. Of the

47
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.340 
two weeks we will have the course about and in addition you

48
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.520 
will have non-graded self tests. After every video

49
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.810 
you will also have graded programming assignments that you

50
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.630 
will have to pass to successfully complete the course.

51
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.120 
If you want to successfully complete the course and you were successful

52
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.290 
you will receive a record of achievement.

53
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.050 
If you are just interested and want to follow on the course, especially

54
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.520 
focusing on the conceptual part in the first

55
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.260 
part of the course, you will receive a confirmation of participation. So

56
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.820 
everyone is welcome to join us on this course. But if you want to

57
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.660 
completely be successful, you will need some fundamentals in

58
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.960 
programming with Python.

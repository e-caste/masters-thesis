00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.980 
In our openHPI course about Cyberthreats
by Malware, we have to give an update to

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.810 
Emotet malware. And these are news -
and these are really good news.

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.270 
You remember Emotet
over the years

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.460 
has been growing and growing and has
become more than just a simple malware.

5
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.170 
It was one of the most
dangerous malware attacks to

6
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.010 
private users, to industries, to
cities, organizations, and others.

7
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.270 
So Emotet is able to change its
code each time it is called up

8
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.850 
simply to avoid detection by anti-virus
programs. So this makes it

9
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.270 
so dangerous and
successful.

10
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.360 
Emotet utilizes several hundreds of servers across
the world with different functionalities,

11
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.370 
functionalities to manage infected
computer systems via an

12
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.030 
Emotet network and to make this network
more silent against take-down attempts.

13
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670 
So Emotet has been used

14
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.840 
not only by the Emotet

15
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.250 
cybercriminals, also by
other cyber criminals

16
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.600 
and malware operators to install their
malware on the victim's computer systems

17
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.650 
like for example
TrickBot or Ryuk.

18
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.590 
The good news is that this
Emotet malware, the Emotet

19
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.720 
network could be disarmed. Here is
a news from February the first

20
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.790 
that FBI and partners around the
world disarmed the Emotet malware.

21
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.660 
This was a common

22
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.360 
attack and a common fight by means
of state authorities and private

23
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.290 
and from security

24
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.810 
vendors from
private sector

25
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.770 
to take down the world's most
dangerous malware system.

26
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.580 
So there's really a good news.
Here you can see the partners,

27
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.930 
it was a result of a world wide
fight against this malware network.

28
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.820 
So in January 2021, law enforcement
agencies from across eight countries

29
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.130 
orchestrated a coordinated take down on
the Emotet. They took over the network

30
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.880 
of the cybercriminals, they could gain control
over the Emotet network infrastructure

31
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.120 
and they could take down
the command and control servers,

32
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.920 
many of them, by the
way in Europe.

33
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.970 
Infected computer systems have been
redirected towards law enforcement

34
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.890 
controlled infrastructure so that
the cybercriminals have no more

35
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.780 
possibilities to get access
to the victim's computers.

36
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.260 
So shortly after the
law enforcements

37
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.700 
delivered a special payload
to remove the Emotet

38
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.820 
malware from all
infected computer systems,

39
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.990 
they want to have finished this
activity in April 25th

40
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.640 
and then the Emotet network is
completely closed. So what's next?

41
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.810 
The law enforcements will try to
bring down more malware and

42
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.650 
its network infrastructures in
the future. We have, it is afraid

43
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.370 
and it seems to be clear, that
cybercriminals will try to elude

44
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.900 
from the law enforcement by
developing more advanced and more

45
00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.330 
resilient malware to infect more
computer systems to make profit

46
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.700 
from the victims.
So it is a

47
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.650 
victory but it's not the end. There
is the race between the attackers,

48
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.300 
cybercriminals and the
law enforcement agency

49
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.080 
to secure people from
such malware attacks.

50
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.220 
What you could do - you could check
if your email address, if your

51
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.980 
username and password have been compromised
by Emotet and you can do this

52
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.860 
with the help of this check which
is here provided under this link.

53
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.810 
So really a good news upcoming
during our course.

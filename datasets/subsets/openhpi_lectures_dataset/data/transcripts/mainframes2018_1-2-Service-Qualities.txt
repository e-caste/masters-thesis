1
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.649 
Yeah, hello, it's me again, Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy,

2
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.329 
and in this video clip, I want to talk about mainframe service

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.039 
qualities. I want to talk about what characterizes an IBM

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.359 
mainframe, what are the Qualities of Service (QoS).

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.269 
And I want to talk about the so called "ities".

6
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.110 
You will see what I mean with "ities" in a few minutes.

7
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.109 
You are seeing some numbers, some some attributes

8
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.969 
concerning the IBM mainframe and now let's talk about some numbers.

9
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.829 
First thing is CPU and speed of CPU.

10
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.779 
CPU speed is measured in the clock rate,

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.449 
which in this case, 5.2GHz with the most current

12
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.189 
model of the IBM mainframes, the C14, and compared to former

13
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.959 
models, for example, the EC12, it was two

14
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.511 
generations before the C14, had a clock rate of 5.5GHz.

15
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.139 
So, it had a higher clock rate.

16
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.939 
But in any case, the C14 is around 20 percent

17
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.799 
faster than the EC12 with a 5.5GHz

18
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.950 
clock rate. What I want to say with these

19
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.939 
things to mention is that the clock rate is only

20
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.669 
one factor that characterizes the speed of the CPU.

21
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.399 
There a lot of other factors, one as example is the cache

22
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.889 
hierarchy. We will come to that at a later video clip

23
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.539 
when I talk about the hardware of the

24
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.189 
C14, especially, of course, the newest and most current

25
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.619 
generation of IBM mainframes.

26
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.599 
And compared to other platforms, also other platforms have really high

27
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.909 
gigahertz clock rates, maybe not that high as the

28
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.349 
IBM mainframe processors, but

29
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.999 
similar in the clock

30
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.619 
rate. And another thing is that in

31
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.599 
our today configurations, we have not just one CPU,

32
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.639 
we have many CPUs. So, we can work with many CPU's in parallel and

33
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.349 
independent to the platform we can have a really huge

34
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.429 
CPU capacity available for a certain configuration.

35
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.049 
So, that's not the most important part when you compare mainframes

36
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.479 
to other platforms. In my opinion, one of the really most important

37
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.879 
characteristics in this case is the high IO and network bandwidth

38
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.439 
and again, a number with the newest

39
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.620 
and most current machine, we can have up to

40
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.499 
832 gigabyte per second transfer rate between

41
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.499 
the physical machine and the peripheral devices and the network and

42
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.479 
I think this is really unique.

43
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.759 
I think you can't find another platform with such a high

44
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.739 
bandwidth when it comes to communication with peripheral devices

45
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.329 
and with the network. When we talk about the availability we

46
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.889 
have in the mainframe area, the possibility to reach the

47
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.629 
famous five nines, means 99.999

48
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.399 
Percent availability. And when we put it the other way round

49
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.439 
and talk about outages, we are around three, four minutes

50
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.189 
per year outage time, now this is really, really

51
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.399 
remarkable. And the reason is that in

52
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.959 
the mainframe environment, we have a so-called Sysplex possibility, we

53
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.459 
will come to Sysplex on a later videoclip

54
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.929 
when we talk about security, the mainframe is the most

55
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.179 
secure platform of all commercial platforms.

56
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.389 
We will come to security also in another video clip.

57
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.219 
Just to mention here, there is a certification, it's called Evaluation

58
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.899 
Assurance Level and a the mainframe got the highest available

59
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.479 
assurance level for commercial machines.

60
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.249 
No other platform reached this high certification

61
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.509 
level. When we talk about transaction rates, we talk about

62
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.499 
an example of an IBM customer is around 750

63
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.169 
million transactions a day.

64
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.879 
And with transaction in this case, we really mean the so-called exit

65
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.739 
transactions. We will come to transactions also in a later video clip.

66
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.819 
When we talk about databases, we talk about terabytes.

67
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.469 
When we talk about the number of main memory that

68
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.709 
is available in one physical machine

69
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.529 
in the IBM platform area,

70
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.249 
we get up to 32 terabyte.

71
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.829 
We talk about main memory not disk devices or something

72
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.479 
like this, 32 terabyte in one single box,

73
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.229 
when we talk about external storage, we talk about petabytes.

74
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.806 
But again, this is not unique what

75
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.459 
it differentiates from other platforms is the same storage

76
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.499 
volume can also be connected on other platforms.

77
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.749 
So as examples, the  DS8K or platforms and

78
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.209 
disk drives from other vendors are also really huge and we

79
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.769 
can connect them to an IBM mainframe.

80
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.479 
We can also connect them to Unix and other servers,

81
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.589 
that's not a differentiation point in this case.

82
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.149 
Many concurrent users, many thousands concurrent and

83
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.589 
in my opinion, one of a really important, unique feature is the workload

84
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.689 
management. And the workload management makes it possible

85
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.489 
to use the machines, the IBM mainframes, on a

86
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.029 
level that is more than 100 percent.

87
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.399 
More than 100 percent, that's not a mistake.

88
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.899 
It means you all the CPU, the CPUs, not just

89
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.699 
one, all the CPUs are 100 percent busy and more than 100

90
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.739 
percent, as example 105 percent means all the CPUs

91
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.569 
are busy and we have five so-called address spaces

92
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.489 
waiting for the CPU. But especially in a mainstream

93
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.439 
environment, we have really different workloads and some workloads

94
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.359 
are very important and gets the service they need and other workloads

95
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.979 
are not that important, as example, batch processing in many cases

96
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.199 
is not that important and so it can wait if other

97
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.529 
workloads with a higher priority need the service.

98
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.599 
And the workload management is really unique in the

99
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.149 
area of IBM mainframes.

100
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.189 
We will also talk about this case in a later videoclip.

101
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.948 
Let's talk about the "ities".

102
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.100 
What are the "ities"?

103
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.419 
Not just in the mainframe environment in general, in the I.T.

104
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.666 
And when you compare I.T. platforms, we talk about RAS.

105
00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:03.339 
RAS is an abbreviation and it stands for

106
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.629 
Reliability, Availability and Serviceability.

107
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.129 
And there are some additionals all ending with these

108
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.789 
"ity" and that's why we call it the "ities".

109
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.489 
It's recoverability, integrity, scalability, manageability,

110
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.759 
security and adaptability.

111
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.649 
We do not go into each and every detail.

112
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.539 
Now, I just want to mention two or

113
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.459 
three of these "ities".

114
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.109 
Let's talk about scalability because mainframe scalability, in

115
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.729 
fact, is unique. So up to 32 systems can be coupled

116
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.949 
in a so-called Sysplex environment into one single system image

117
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.449 
and Sysplex enabled application can be started on

118
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:57.099 
one system and taken over on the fly by another

119
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.199 
system. And this is really important also as an example for

120
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.659 
maintenance issues.

121
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.319 
So system updates can be done online.

122
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.909 
It means you have different operating system coupled into a single system

123
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.469 
image. And when you want to make maintenance

124
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.359 
and go on a higher,

125
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.889 
as example, system version, you can take one

126
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:31.389 
system after the other out of such a Sysplex

127
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.079 
environment, bring it back with a new level.

128
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.579 
And so with the so-called Rolling IPL, Rolling IPL means, IPL stands

129
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.499 
for Initial Program Load and is nothing more than the booting

130
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.389 
of an operating system.

131
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.949 
But because many systems are coupled into one single system image, you

132
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.658 
can take one after the other system out of the Sysplex

133
00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.286 
environment, bring it back on the newer level, and

134
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.979 
you can do maintenance without stopping your applications.

135
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.759 
A very unique feature, very unique function

136
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.609 
on the IBM mainframes.

137
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.429 
Security, we already talked about the evaluation assurance

138
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:23.169 
level that I mentioned already. And the most important reason

139
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.100 
that the mainframe is the most secure platform

140
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.499 
is the storage key. It's a hardware key built into the

141
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.869 
storage of the IBM mainframe storage and

142
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.279 
with the storage key as example, no buffer overflow is possible.

143
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.649 
It's one of the most often used security

144
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:53.239 
breaches that that are done

145
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.380 
when it comes to a hacker

146
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.869 
hacking things, the most important thing

147
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.429 
is buffer overflow and they are not possible because of

148
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:12.139 
the hardware storage. One important note

149
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.609 
in this case is that it's different in z/VM.

150
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.529 
So, it's really only available when we use z/OS

151
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.679 
system in logical partitions.

152
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.539 
And it's not possible as an example, when we have an z/VM

153
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.899 
in between as a virtualization layer.

154
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.549 
And in addition to this

155
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.989 
hardware support, we have software support

156
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.799 
that is implemented with a security manager in

157
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.309 
typical IBM environment. This is RACF - Resource Access Control Facility

158
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.079 
or also other vendors have products in this case, ACF2

159
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.280 
or Top Secret.

160
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.629 
Let's talk about outages. I don't go into too much detail here.

161
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.899 
There are a lot of analytics available in the Internet concerning

162
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.059 
cost of outages.

163
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.409 
In any case, I think it's very, very clear, especially when it comes to banking

164
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.909 
transactions, when it comes to flight reservation systems and

165
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.649 
so on. Outage costs a lot of money and so

166
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.389 
we have to do a lot of things

167
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.339 
to prevent outages.

168
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.109 
And we have to think about how can really be availability

169
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.610 
can be increased.

170
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.658

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.410 
Welcome to this video clip in which we
discuss traces and trace variants.

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.750 
So what is a trace? A trace is a crucial
ingredient in process mining. The trace

3
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.910 
represents all events that are
correlated to a given case. The

4
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.160 
traces are based on instance
correlation that we discussed earlier.

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.450 
And we can find all traces by filtering
the event log on case identifiers

6
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.280 
and the case identifier in
our example is the claim ID.

7
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.660 
If we do that we find a number of
claims in our sample scenario. So here

8
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.520 
we have a trace for the case with the
claim identifier 1234.

9
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.290 
And that is receive claim,
check claim completeness,

10
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.500 
decide on coverage, prepare
acceptance, send acceptance letter.

11
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.950 
So these are the events that are
part that contribute to the

12
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.280 
case with the case identifier 1234.

13
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.830 
Then we have the same sequence for
the case with the identifier

14
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.160 
1239 and the same
for 1235,

15
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.440 
1244 and 1243.

16
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.480 
The second type of traces
that we see here relate to

17
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.370 
cases in which the claim could
not be covered. So here we have

18
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.250 
receive claim 1238, check claim completeness

19
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.900 
1238, decide on
coverage and prepare rejection

20
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.780 
and send rejection letter.
So these are cases

21
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.440 
in which the claim
could not be covered.

22
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.140 
And the same holds for 1241, 1237,

23
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.980 
1242 and 1245.

24
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.100 
We see something interesting, if
if we look at these traces we

25
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.510 
see that there are two traces that
somehow look pretty incomplete

26
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.350 
themselves. So
we have here

27
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.890 
a trace, receive claim 1236,
check claim completeness

28
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.660 
1236 and then that

29
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.500 
case stops. So the trace is
completely there. And we

30
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
have the same trace here for
1240 in which we only have

31
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.900 
receive claim and check claim
coverage. So these are

32
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.860 
traces that we found based on the
data that was created during

33
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.250 
the execution of
the process.

34
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.810 
And this leads us to
trace variants. So

35
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.950 
traces can be classified resulting
in trace variants and this

36
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.640 
is actually what we did already
in the previous slide right.

37
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.820 
We had this organization these three parts
and each of these three parts represent

38
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.850 
one process variant. So the
first process variant

39
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.140 
includes all claim process
instances that could be granted.

40
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.950 
That is here we
have again

41
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.140 
the complete trace rc, 1234
and so forth and

42
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.970 
we have the same behavior so the
same trace variant we can observe

43
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.730 
for the cases 1239 and so forth.

44
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.110 
As a second trace
variant we have the

45
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.460 
all claim instances that need to be
rejected that could not be granted

46
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.570 
and here we have the first
one again is the

47
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.510 
trace for 1238. Also
this claim needed to be

48
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.040 
rejected and that's part of the second
trace variant of rejected claims.

49
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.830 
And we have the incomplete claim
instances. And that's just

50
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.170 
two of those, we
have rc, 1236 and

51
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.170 
receive claim 1236
check claim completeness

52
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.500 
1236 and then the trace
stops and the same for

53
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.400 
1240.

54
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.420 
So that's basically an important
step that we now have the

55
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.590 
trace variants because trace variants
are very important for process mining.

56
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.590 
Depending on the process mining and
concretely process discovery algorithms

57
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.350 
there is a way to add frequency
to this as well. So some

58
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.390 
process mining algorithms use
frequency to indicate how often

59
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.220 
a certain trace has
been observed.

60
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.460 
The basis or the idea behind this
is that it's very different.

61
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.210 
If you have like ten thousand cases
whether a certain trace appears

62
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.220 
three thousand times of those ten
thousand times or just five

63
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.160 
or ten times maybe. So looking at
the numbers, the frequencies adds

64
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.490 
to the value that we can get
out of process mining algorithms.

65
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.700 
For notation perspective we can do
this as follows - so here we have

66
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.740 
we have the traces, so that's the
first trace that's the acceptance

67
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.190 
trace if you want that occurred
five times because we have

68
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.040 
here 1234, 1239, 1235

69
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.120 
1244 and 1243 and these are five

70
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.270 
cases. So in five cases

71
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.000 
claims could
be accepted.

72
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.620 
In five other cases the
claim needs to be rejected

73
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.600 
and we have two cases that end
prematurely after checking claim

74
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.290 
completeness.

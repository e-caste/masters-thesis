00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.070 
Welcome to our coffee talk session for our
openHPI course "Digital Entrepreneurship".

3
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.090 
For this course,  we aim to
introduce you as our students to

4
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.080 
the world of digital entrepreneurship
with an emphasis on entrepreneurship

5
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.230 
research and its
application.

6
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.990 
We are glad to have today with us one of
the most inspiring, I personally know,

7
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.580 
expert for impact entrepreneurship
Christoph Schmitz and

8
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.350 
an advocate for actually doing
what you just want to do. So

9
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.480 
Christoph, thank you so much for
joining us today and we're eager

10
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.670 
to learn about your perspective
on impact entrepreneurship,

11
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.560 
the connection to digital
technologies and I hope you have

12
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.620 
your coffee or tea - I
just have water today -

13
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.480 
ready and let's
get started.

14
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.520 
Who are you, what is your
background and what do you do?

15
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.240 
Yes, thank you very much for
the invitation. First of all,

16
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.770 
yeah I'm I have an agricultural
background. I originally come

17
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.640 
from a farm and I also studied
this together with economics and

18
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.410 
when then into science, I was in the
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research

19
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.690 
and I was researching a lot
about the food system

20
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.410 
in the world. But at the same
time I have an entrepreneurial

21
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.620 
heart and when my
daughter was born,

22
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.870 
I was asking myself how she can
learn about food and nature

23
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.310 
and agriculture when she's
growing up in the city.

24
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.670 
And I was looking at the school system
where this is really educated for the

25
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.980 
for the kids and this is not really
happening and so I started

26
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.160 
to bring the farm to the
schools and kindergartens.

27
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.140 
That's called Gemüse Academy, translated
it's something like 'vegetable academy'

28
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.860 
and I started seven years ago
and we are non-profit

29
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.630 
but with a very
entrepreneurial spirit.

30
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.380 
And now we are
working at

31
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.660 
over eight hundred schools and kindergartens
with over thirty thousand kids.

32
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.990 
And with our start-up academia,
we are also addressing private

33
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.840 
persons are with food
education and also companies.

34
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.390 
Thank you. I remember when we met
for the first time, that was

35
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.060 
in my office years ago, and you
presented me your business model

36
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.210 
and your business plan and I was
always like okay, so how will

37
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.750 
you make money with it. And you
and your team just said, well

38
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.980 
it's not about making money, it's about
something else. It's about having impact.

39
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.160 
So that for me actually that was a
great learning experience and I still

40
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.220 
am very fond of it. So thank you for that.
How would you define impact entrepreneurship?

41
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.350 
Yeah, that's an important and
interesting question because

42
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.970 
it is really defined
very differently. And

43
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.100 
I have a quite radical definition because
social entrepreneurs are impact

44
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.020 
entrepreneurs. I would rather
say a social entrepreneur

45
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.520 
because impact entrepreneur
impact, every company has an impact.

46
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.900 
That's really hard to do. Good point.

47
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.160 
But a social entrepreneur tries
to solve a social problem, a

48
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.040 
problem which should not exist
which is a systemic or systematic

49
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.740 
mistake or error, an error in the
system. And so in the end, our

50
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.340 
our goal is to to solve
this mistake and

51
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.150 
having a different system. So we
want to change the system and

52
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.230 
when we have changed the system,
our mission is accomplished.

53
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.830 
So we can turn
down our company.

54
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.090 
So that's quite
radical but

55
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.180 
I mean, just making example of
our company means that we want

56
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.450 
to have food, education in every
school and kindergarten and

57
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.470 
it cannot be that we are in the
twenty first century talking

58
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.960 
about a lot of

59
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.710 
sustainability issues and this
topic is not included in the

60
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.910 
in the educational
system. And

61
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.530 
why is it not the case? Because
there are a lot of problems

62
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.460 
and we try to solve these problems
and in the end we want to

63
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.760 
change the system that this is
just normal that when you are

64
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.570 
a parent and bring your kids to
the school or kindergarten,

65
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.770 
you are sure that this will be learned
like math or German or sports.

66
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.470 
And when this is solved, we can
shut down and solve another problem

67
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.580 
and we do not want to generate
we want not to take this or want

68
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.320 
not to have more problems
in this term and to

69
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.080 
have our business alive. We can
solve another problem. So, that

70
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.650 
is a big difference I think from
some entrepreneurs and you can

71
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.200 
see also the differences
although they have

72
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.310 
different definitions out
there. Yeah, that's true.

73
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.370 
So, I mean, what role do digital
technologies play for you? I

74
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.180 
mean, I would expect now you talked
about vegetables and actually

75
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.270 
probably working with the hands
right? I know that the school

76
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.450 
of my children also
have one of your

77
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.130 
Gemüse Academy. So, you know, it's always
about getting your hands dirty. So,

78
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.430 
I mean, is it
digital at all?

79
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.170 
Yes, so I mean, but it's a very relevant
question because especially

80
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.130 
the first years I got this
question "hey why this is really

81
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.310 
important?" I mean, we need digital education
and not making your hands dirty

82
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.150 
and but my answer was the more
digital life we have, the more

83
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.320 
important it is that the
kids know how things

84
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.990 
grow, vegetables grow, or also other
things which you do with your hands and

85
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.110 
which tell you a lot about real
life and real nature. And, but

86
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.180 
right from the start it was
important that we combine both

87
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.280 
worlds. We do not want to bring
the kids fifty years back and

88
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.360 
say, okay, now you are in
a different world.

89
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
Just take your smartphone with you
you can make photos of this, you can

90
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.820 
show your parents

91
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.870 
how big the vegetables are you have
grown or something like this. So

92
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.390 
we want to integrate this. We have
a digital learning platform

93
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.760 
for our teachers which is our main
target group and we want to address

94
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.360 
them with the new tools. We have
also cooperation with the HPI.

95
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.410 
So it shows that we want to
combine both worlds and with the

96
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.420 
Corona crisis it's even more important that
we have a lot of digital workshops.

97
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.760 
So it's a perfect
combination for us.

98
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.270 
That's actually an interesting point.
So what happened to all those school

99
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.240 
gardens and fields during the
pandemic? I mean were the kids

100
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.970 
still allowed to work? I mean, they
were not many of them were

101
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.260 
not in school for many
weeks, right? Yes.

102
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.550 
First of all, it's a big challenge
for us of course when the schools are

103
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:46.250 
closed but on the other hand
it's also a possibility and

104
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.020 
maybe it's an advantage that we
are outside. So, because it makes

105
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.210 
our topic even bigger and schools
and kindergartens now think

106
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.110 
okay, how can we extend our
learning spaces and

107
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.150 
the outside is
definitely, definitely

108
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.750 
something which is
underestimated.

109
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.790 
And on the other hand with
with our program, we can also

110
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.120 
bring the kids outside.

111
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.120 
Also in the pandemic situation
that we have a lot of kids who

112
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.540 
are still in school in
the so called 'Notbetreuung'

113
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.350 
and the teachers were really
happy that they could

114
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.350 
go outside and think that they
have something positive to tell

115
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.750 
and not saying
okay this

116
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.950 
class is also shut down
now. We have to

117
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.820 
we have to find
something else.

118
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:46.820 
This is a big advantage of our program. Yeah true. So what
are the challenges for social entrepreneurs?

119
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:54.120 
I would assume that many people you talk
to in the beginning but probably still

120
00:08:54.340 --> 00:09:00.010 
reacted similar as I did. So, you know
how did you earn money or

121
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:05.150 
we know that schools at least
in Germany are not very open

122
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.980 
usually. So, I mean, what were your
challenges and what maybe

123
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:16.090 
also would be your your wishes
to those stakeholders in this

124
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.890 
ecosystem? Yes, of course it's
quite new and not many people

125
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.950 
know the term social
entrepreneurship

126
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.690 
and we want to advocate more
for this especially, that this

127
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.210 
can also be big. Not just - okay, that
is a program for some schools

128
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.360 
in Berlin or something. So we have
the aim that we reach every

129
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.740 
school and for this we
need a really smart

130
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.880 
social business model

131
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.350 
because we from the first day
on we said we do not want to

132
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.890 
be a classical non-profit who's just
generating donations and

133
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:58.020 
can provide the service to so
many schools like they have gotten

134
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.060 
donations. So we have built a
business model which means

135
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.850 
that we get of course support from
ministries, foundations and companies

136
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.450 
but just for four years.

137
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:14.540 
In those four years, we bring all the
knowledge to the school, we teach them.

138
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.910 
We provide them with
all our assets

139
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.990 
and afterwards we are just there
with our digital platform.

140
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.080 
So they have the knowledge, but
we still support them with our

141
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.920 
platform. But this is
quite scalable and

142
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.490 
cheap. So they can provide just
the service fee for this and

143
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.050 
we do not need any donations
or any supporters

144
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.610 
and can grow further then. So
it's quite scalable, this model,

145
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.290 
but in the end, in our case, the
case of education, of course

146
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.510 
it's especially, in Germany,
it's of a course task and

147
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.360 
duty of the state. So we
need to have politics

148
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.050 
to get the politics in
the ministries in

149
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.390 
to have it really in the end at every
school in every kindergarten. Right,

150
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.190 
so,

151
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:12.320 
if you were to make a wish what
social entrepreneurship should

152
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:18.220 
become in Germany, what would be your
your wish? What would be your hope?

153
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.580 
It should be, of course, much more
mainstream than it is now.

154
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.100 
I mean, everyone wants to everyone in
the field of economics wants to

155
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.740 
found a startup a for-profit
startup and make an exit and so

156
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.570 
on gets finance from venture
capitalists and so on.

157
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.900 
But there we need more people who think
okay we can make the famous similar things

158
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.630 
with a much higher impact and with
really generating a social profit.

159
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.560 
It's in the end of course
not a private profit

160
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.980 
but I think and I hope that
more and more people

161
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.870 
think that this is not the most
important thing in your life. And

162
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.500 
then it's for me it's
much more interesting

163
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.020 
field than for-profit. For-
profit usually has a

164
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.280 
product and you have to

165
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.390 
find your market and then you
have to grow. It's of course a

166
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.320 
big challenge but solving a
social problem which have

167
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.780 
which has not been
solved in the past

168
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.080 
hundred years it's even a much
bigger challenge and you need

169
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.130 
much more different people to solve
the problem and this makes it

170
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:34.400 
everyday very exciting to work for
a real social entrepreneur or a

171
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.380 
social business. Right, I would
actually be more positive. So,

172
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.440 
if I talk to my students, my
impression is that they want to

173
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.160 
make that change or they want to
make that impact. So I think,

174
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.870 
looking at the young
generation, they really feel,

175
00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.670 
well, maybe not the need yet, but
they are inclined to become

176
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.380 
change drivers of change. So I
think they can actually they

177
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:13.030 
do imagine themselves to actually
do this. However what often

178
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.650 
lacks is
the courage

179
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:23.000 
to do. So, what would be your
recommendation to these young students?

180
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.680 
Because I know that many
of them they actually come

181
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.440 
to me saying well I think social
entrepreneurship or I want

182
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.040 
to become a social entrepreneur but I'm
afraid. I'm afraid, you know, because of

183
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.090 
not earning enough money, I'm
afraid of what my parents will

184
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.940 
say, what my you know what the
surrounding will say, I'm afraid that

185
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.510 
my impact will not be big
enough. So, I think the

186
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.910 
fears are actually a little
higher because it's not as

187
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.520 
established yet. So what would be your
recommendation for these young and

188
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.600 
hopefully old
people as well?

189
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.260 
Yeah, of course, just
do it. Just do it

190
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.780 
and don't hear your surroundings because
definitely if I would have done this

191
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.380 
I would not exist because everyone
was saying, especially when

192
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.540 
you have a young family, a kid and so on
that you should do something serious.

193
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.610 
But in the end you should really hear
your own and on your heart and

194
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.060 
there are very interesting examples of really
successful social entrepreneurship

195
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.310 
entrepreneurs. And they are
not in the mainstream media

196
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.610 
but they are existing. And if
you look for example to Ashoka,

197
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.810 
who's one of the pioneers in the
field of social entrepreneurship,

198
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.950 
you find a lot of
examples there. And

199
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.300 
they would give you
more courage and

200
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.790 
then, just especially now
in Berlin, there are a lot of

201
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.810 
good also good startups and examples
and get in touch with them and

202
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.310 
just try it out.

203
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.130 
I mean, I was in the end saying,
I was twenty nine when

204
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.800 
I was starting and

205
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.210 
I said okay, I can make this for five years
and then I'm a thirty four. I mean,

206
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.320 
even if this really crashed down,
and is a stupid idea, I'm not -

207
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.430 
there will be
something for me

208
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.060 
as the risk is not that high.
Right, well thank you so much.

209
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.720 
I think that was really inspiring.
So, thank you for taking your

210
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.750 
time today and I hope
to talk to you soon.

211
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.520 
Thank you very much. It was
a big pleasure. Thanks.

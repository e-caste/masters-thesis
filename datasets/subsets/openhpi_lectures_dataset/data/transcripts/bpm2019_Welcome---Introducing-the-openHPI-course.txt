00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.560 
Ladies and Gentlemen Iâ€™d like to
welcome you to our new openHPI

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.020 
course on business processes:
modeling, simulation, execution.

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.530 
In this video clip I like to introduce
you to the organization of the course.

4
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
I like to start with the course
Materials. The lecture videos

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.710 
are very important and we
will provide the content of

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.320 
the course in a series of short video clips
of about ten to fifteen minutes length.

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
You will also be provided with a
PDF files of the lecture slides

8
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.560 
so that you can work on the content
of the course in a bit more detail.

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.200 
Here and there we will also provide
additional reading material

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.740 
for you to deepen your knowledge
on the course content.

11
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.900 
I also like to remark that we reuse
lecture videos from our previous courses

12
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.200 
and this applies to weeks one,
two, three where we introduce

13
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.260 
let's say the foundations of
business process management, basic

14
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.900 
business process modelling and
the analysis and

15
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.060 
we analyze business
process behavior.

16
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
These parts did not change content
wise from the previous

17
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.760 
courses so we just can import these. But we
will also have updated and new material

18
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.310 
and this applies to week four, week
five and week six where we discussed

19
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.060 
business decision modeling. And
of course the two new weeks

20
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.910 
that are run by our partners
from signavio and camunda.

21
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780 
We will also provide tests
Assignments  and the final exam.

22
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.110 
Self test can be used to check
learning progress. After each

23
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.180 
video clip you will be provided
with self tests that you can use

24
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.970 
to deepen your understanding of what
you have witnessed in the video clip.

25
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.220 
The self tests are not graded and they
can be repeated as often as you like.

26
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.810 
There will also be weekly homework
assignments and once you

27
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.660 
started with a homework assignment you
have sixty minutes to complete them.

28
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.040 
Homework assignments are graded
and they cannot be repeated.

29
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.440 
And we offer a final examination
in week seven and that takes

30
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.370 
ninety minutes for
you to complete.

31
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.680 
There are different records on HPI that
you can achieve in this course.

32
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.350 
The first is that you can get a
confirmation of participation and

33
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.930 
you will receive a this record when
you visited at least fifty percent

34
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.640 
of the course material.

35
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.900 
You can also get a record
of achievement.

36
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.740 
This record you get when you
when you gain fifty percent

37
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.800 
of the overall score from the
homework assignments and also

38
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.540 
from the final exam. You can also be
awarded a qualified certificate

39
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.300 
that is from the what you have to
do the same as the one before

40
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.080 
as a fifty percent of the
overall score. But this

41
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.250 
qualified certificate has a participant's
photo and it also comes with a

42
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.790 
with a price tag. For more
information please take a look at

43
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.600 
the open web page where
further details are provided.

44
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.210 
You are in an online course with
hundreds or thousands of learners

45
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.200 
and you're not alone in this course,
so you can share your experiences,

46
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.300 
your questions with your our peers
in a discussion forum that

47
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.870 
is also provided by the platform.
So you can use the forum to

48
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.940 
discuss the course topics with
your peers and you can also

49
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.350 
provide feedback to us. But please be
respectful to your fellow course participants

50
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.630 
and also please be respectful and
positive to the teaching team.

51
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.630 
There's also a help desk that
you can pose your questions to.

52
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.760 
And you will find the help desk
button on the right border

53
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.230 
of your browser window.

54
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.550 
The help desk you can ask when
you have technical questions

55
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.230 
related to your log-in and your
registration or to technical

56
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.480 
issues with the submission of
your homework or your exam.

57
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.690 
You can also pose course specific
questions to the help desk

58
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.600 
and these are sent directly
to the teaching team.

59
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.460 
As a participant of
an openHPI course

60
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.870 
please follow the openHPI Honor
Code. So you are requested

61
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.550 
not to share your access to
openHPI with another person.

62
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.800 
You are requested to work on
homework assignments and exams

63
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.930 
on your own and without
the help of others.

64
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.040 
You are requested not to publish
or use course materials without

65
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.110 
written permission
by the author.

66
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.350 
You are requested not to make
available solutions to homework

67
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.050 
and exams in any way to other participants,
also not the forum or by e-mail.

68
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.470 
And finally you are requested
not to publish on openHPI any

69
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.330 
material unrelated to the objectives
of a social learning platform.

70
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.280 
There is a standard BPM textbook
and most course topics are

71
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.150 
actually covered by this textbook and
Springer-Verlag offers participants

72
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.660 
a twenty per cent discount on hard copies
and a fifty per cent discount on e-books.

73
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.570 
To use this offer please follow the
links in the internal pages of our

74
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.990 
openHPI course. However buying
this book is not required for

75
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.290 
successfully participating in
the course, it just gives

76
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.400 
you more information about what
is covered in the course.

77
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.500 
During this course we will also have
a number of process modelling tasks

78
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.690 
and I am very happy to announce
that Signavio provides free

79
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.080 
of charge access to this
Signavio process editor.

80
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.830 
You can register at this url
that you see here and the

81
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.500 
free access to the complete system is
limited to a period of sixty days.

82
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.320 
Again like to note that the use
of this Signavio process or

83
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.690 
editor is not required for successfully
participating in this course. You might

84
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.850 
also use another process
modelling tool for this.

85
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.620 
Finally I like to introduce you to
the weekly open HPI process.

86
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.750 
So on monday morning at ten
o'clock all the material will

87
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.020 
be published on the
openHPI page.

88
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.330 
So we have a publication of
lecture videos of the teaching

89
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.820 
Material, of the self test and of
the homework of the whole week.

90
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.430 
Your process starts from that time
on where you can watch videos

91
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.080 
you can do the
self tests.

92
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.050 
And it's a very good idea to
start with a homework only

93
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.200 
after you've watched all video
lectures of that week. Because

94
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.730 
once you started the homework you
have sixty minutes to complete

95
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.230 
the homework and you cannot
redo the homework again.

96
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.210 
the homework must be completed before
wednesday at ten in the evening

97
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.350 
of the following weeks so its
nine days after the publication

98
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.790 
of the course content. And it's
important that you take a careful

99
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.550 
look at the time zone that you're
in so all times are central

100
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.180 
european time and you need to submit
your homework before wednesday

101
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.750 
a ten o'clock in the evening
central european time.

102
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.580 
Solutions to the homework are
provided on thursdays on the

103
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.150 
next day at ten o'clock
in the morning.

104
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.100 
The final exam can be taken in the
seventh week of our course and

105
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.600 
that is from monday June twenty fourth
at ten o'clock in the morning

106
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.970 
and the deadline for completion is
a wednesday the third of July

107
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.300 
at twenty two hours.

108
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.620 
On this slide you will see a model, a
graphical representation of the

109
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.220 
course schedules. So
you see the individual weeks

110
00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:01.500 
and I hope that it's now clear
how the openHPI weeks work here.

111
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.690 
All right with that I like to
conclude this introductory

112
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.090 
video clip also on behalf of the
teaching team. We are really glad

113
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.840 
to have you on board and we wish you
a very good learning experience.

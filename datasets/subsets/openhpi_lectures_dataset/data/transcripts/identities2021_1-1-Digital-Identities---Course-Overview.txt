00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.950 
Now we want to introduce Digital
Identities. This is the topic of our

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.240 
OpenHPI course about
digital identities,

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.720 
and the question is Who
we are on the internet?

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.060 
Ofcourse with the physical
identities we know how to deal,

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.360 
this is what we do in everyday
life. But before we can use a

6
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.010 
web service on the internet, we have
to identify ourself to the service,

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.650 
because the service needs to be able
to recognize who we are,

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.450 
and when we come next time to
remember which permissions we have.

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.390 
As I mentioned in
the physical world,

10
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.610 
identification is easy. We identify
ourselves through our outer appearance,

11
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.210 
with our physical identity. So people
who know us can remember our face.

12
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.230 
our outer appearance. our voice and
then say, okay this is Christoph Meinel.

13
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.750 
But how we can identify
ourselves on the internet?

14
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.110 
To show a photo or video and to claim
this is Christoph Meinel it's very easy.

15
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.360 
But for the partner, it's completely
unclear whether it's only

16
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.100 
a photo or whether
it's a real identity.

17
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.100 
So we can't identify ourselves
through our physical presence, but

18
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.710 
what we can do we can represent and
identify ourself by a collection of

19
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.220 
electronic data. And exactly this is a
digital identity, a collection of

20
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.050 
electronic data, in more detail
of electronic attributes.

21
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.210 
Such attributes are for example, our
address, our password, our email address,

22
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.710 
our passport ID, our credit card, the
telephone number or the account number.

23
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.340 
So a combination of these data
identifies ourself and forms a

24
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.820 
digital identity.

25
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.920 
What we have to do
when we want to

26
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.550 
use a web service,
we have to prove

27
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.290 
that we own such a digital identity,
it is our data.

28
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
This telephone data and this
email data and others.

29
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.300 
So there are numerous ways to provide
such a proof, we can prove that we own

30
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.690 
a digital identity by knowing
something, for example knowing

31
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.500 
a secret password or
knowing a secret pin.

32
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.430 
We can prove the ownership by the
ownership of something, for example,

33
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.180 
a smart card or a token.

34
00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.850 
We can prove that we own this or we can show
biometric characteristics, for example,

35
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.460 
fingerprint or
face or iris.

36
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.630 
But most common and a very simple
method is the use of passwords.

37
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.570 
These are easy to implement with
little effort for the user,

38
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.180 
but we have to remember this use of password
for authentication is quite unsecure

39
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.730 
and holds great
dangers. Original

40
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.620 
approach to submit such
a proof by knowing a password

41
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.920 
was introduced when the personal computers
came up. So to prove to the computer

42
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.980 
that I am allowed
to access this data.

43
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.960 
But to use for authentication
of a web service,

44
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.790 
there are many problems and
weaknesses and we will discuss about

45
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.460 
this. The password must be stored
in the database of the service.

46
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.330 
So when we register and
we design a password,

47
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.580 
we have to remember the password
and the service has to remember

48
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.970 
the password. So the service stores the
passwords in its customer database,

49
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.610 
and later on the service
is able to verify

50
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.960 
that this password belongs to us,
to verify our digital identity

51
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.040 
during the
login process.

52
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.420 
In a professional way the data,
the password is not allowed to

53
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.670 
secured in the database in
clear text, but it has to be

54
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.060 
stored in hashed form so that
all the people working

55
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.310 
outside of the service are not able
to understand the password itself.

56
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.320 
There are many attacks
known to try to steal

57
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.100 
the user data. User data are most
interesting for cyber

58
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.350 
criminals, because with this user
data they can access a service

59
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.330 
and can interact with the
service under the stolen name.

60
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.610 
And the possibilities how attackers
can attack a service to

61
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.610 
steal user data, this is by exploiting
some software vulnerabilities.

62
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.020 
This is possible by
social engineering,

63
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.120 
for example, to play

64
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.590 
that they are an administrator of
the service and ask the user to send him

65
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.210 
or to tell him the password
to install something.

66
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.680 
So the stolen identity data can
in many different ways be misused,

67
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.990 
and the idea every time is to assume
a digital identity, and then

68
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.890 
interact with the service, use
the resources of the services

69
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.110 
in the name of that
identity. This is the

70
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.410 
field of identity theft
we will discuss

71
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.480 
in the course more about this.

72
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.890 
So such identity leaks
here is a short

73
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.220 
report of a very recent case,
under the name Collection

74
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.810 
number 1 to
number 5.

75
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:35.230 
Records were published on the internet
in January 2019,

76
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.610 
that contained a total of
2.1 one billion

77
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:47.120 
email addresses with the
corresponding passwords in plain text.

78
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:53.240 
So these are ofcourse identity data,
and this is a huge amount of identity

79
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.920 
data which were published in the
internet and the cybercriminals could access,

80
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.210 
could take this data and
then work with this data.

81
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.350 
In some cases the exact services
from which the identity data

82
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.180 
was stolen were specified, so that
it becomes very easy

83
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.020 
for the attacker to misuse
an identity for that

84
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:24.470 
particular service and the attackers can
quickly test identity access data

85
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.450 
for different platforms, simply because
the users often use the same password

86
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.610 
for different services.

87
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.290 
This identity leaks and
this identity theft

88
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.260 
is extremely dangerous, it's extremely
dangerous for the persons affected.

89
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.530 
Reason is their digital identities
remain vulnerable as long

90
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.370 
as the stolen password

91
00:07:53.510 --> 00:08:00.610 
are valid. So as long as they do not change the
password, the cybercriminals could misuse

92
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:06.360 
the identity in using the
service. Here is another case,

93
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.790 
in December 2018,
data and documents of roughly a

94
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.950 
1000 politicians and celebrities
were published in the internet,

95
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.200 
and these data include internal and personal
documents, as well as contact data

96
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.090 
such as email addresses,

97
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:32.930 
telephone numbers, or post address
of the celebrities concerned.

98
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.540 
And it caused a lot of discussion.
How was it possible

99
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.950 
for the cybercriminals
to a collect such

100
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.130 
personal data?

101
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.290 
So the more identity
data about a person

102
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.090 
comes in the hands
of the cybercriminals,

103
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.280 
the more easily these identities
can be misused. So it's a real

104
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.370 
problem and it's very
important to know more about

105
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.920 
digital identities, ways how they
can be established, the ways

106
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.830 
how to manage such identities
and how to use it.

107
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.980 
So what we want to do in our
course in the first week,

108
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:27.160 
we will speak in general digital
identities, who I am in the internet?

109
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:32.610 
And in the first course week, we consider
how digital identities are defined

110
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.620 
and we discuss the different ways
to manage such digital identities.

111
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.190 
So it is the topic of identity
management which is a in the center

112
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.990 
of the first week. And we
discuss how to prove

113
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.550 
that one has a certain
digital identity.

114
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.150 
And these our the discussions
of authentication methods

115
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.530 
we want to do in the first week.
And then in the second week,

116
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.270 
we deal with questions
which attacks

117
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:11.010 
are known on digital identities,
which attacks are possible and how

118
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.240 
best to protect your digital
identity. And in addition, we

119
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.410 
look at the problem of weak
passwords and give advises

120
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:28.300 
on how to choose strong passwords and
what influence strong passwords have

121
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:34.550 
on possible attacks.
Because the identification by

122
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:40.450 
passwords is very common in the
internet and we have to deal

123
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:45.960 
with this relatively weak
method in a best possible way.

124
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.450 
So to introduce the teaching team,
my name is Christiph Meinel, I am

125
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.640 
the head of the Hasso Plattner Institute
and run the chair for

126
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:01.140 
Internet Technologies and Systems.
This research focuses

127
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:07.990 
on security engineering, on learning and
knowledge engineering, digital education

128
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.190 
and innovation research.
And I am supported

129
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:18.940 
by my PhD students, Alexander Muhle
and Chris Pelchen. Alexander

130
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.280 
is working in his

131
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.770 
research for the thesis on Secure
Identities on peer to peer applications

132
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.910 
with certification process in
international consortium.

133
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:39.140 
And Chris Pelchen is working in
the field of security engineering,

134
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.450 
identity on the internet and has a
lot to do with this a a digital

135
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.520 
identity theft and our service
to inform you about this.

136
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.560 
So this is the
introduction to our

137
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.790 
new openHPI course, digital identities. We
hope you are interested to

138
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.080 
learn more about that.

139
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:09.600 
We are happy if you stay with us
and if you start to interact

140
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:16.390 
with the other learners by using
our discussion forum, by

141
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.090 
answering the questions
in the quizzes and in the

142
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.140 
homeworks. And hope also you
have fun with the course.

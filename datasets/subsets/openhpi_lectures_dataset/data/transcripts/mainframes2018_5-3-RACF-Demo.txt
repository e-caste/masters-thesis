00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.959 
Hello, it's me again.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.329 
Welcome, guys, from the European Union Academy.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.069 
And this next video clip, I want to give you a demonstration

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.049 
of the security and environment

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.389 
on the US system.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.099 
And in our case, I access our mainframe with

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.869 
Viertel. We are to listen and product

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.669 
from a French company to access

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.849 
the immolation trust with powers.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.559 
I don't need to install any toilet insulation

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.369 
on my workstation.

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.909 
So I select TIAs over here and I get a message from us

13
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.879 
all to end user ID.

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
I do this good WCR, then I have to give you my password.

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.459 
And this is already an interface to hackers because this password

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.649 
is now checked with the entry

17
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.229 
and if it's identical, I get access to our

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.749 
two year old and 20 years is now

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.319 
allows me to set up a session.

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.879 
The first message I get here, I see each in each

21
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.589 
case when they are come, the message with z/OS is the first three

22
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.479 
characters I h its message from Rucker's.

23
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.099 
And in this case, we see the message states that the last access

24
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.839 
was at twenty, twenty, forty two on Wednesday,

25
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.779 
November 28, 2008 18.

26
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.729 
And now I'm in our ISP environment, iSelect,

27
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.289 
our PDF environment and in our PDF environment.

28
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.089 
I go to our OR command

29
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.069 
menu and here I can give it its own commands and commands

30
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.959 
are O commands.

31
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.949 
And I told you in the last video clip

32
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.739 
that there are different profiles in

33
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.509 
F and there are commands to list such profiles and

34
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.089 
one command now two lists are terrible violence list user

35
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.899 
list user means. Give me information about the user

36
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.459 
profile and if I don't give in any parameter, I get information

37
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.769 
about my own user already.

38
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.209 
And normally each and every user can type in the list user

39
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.769 
command and gets information about his environment

40
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.359 
and all user can really just list his

41
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.710 
own profile.

42
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.779 
I do it now and list in this case, my own profile.

43
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.440 
You see, the user name is the Easy

44
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.079 
User ID is all WCR and there is the name.

45
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.179 
It's my name Wolfram Guys.

46
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.279 
And it's important that we get really

47
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.599 
information who is behind this user ID?

48
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.609 
And you also see the name when there are some messages

49
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.630 
on the console went and pressed into service and so on.

50
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.929 
The name of the user who uses

51
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.679 
this user profile is

52
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.399 
also within the log records.

53
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.289 
And I get a lot of information about the security environment,

54
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.529 
OK, because I'm a special user, I have a special

55
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.209 
authority. I can also list other user profiles.

56
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.369 
I want to do it and I can abbreviate list user with allu

57
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.109 
list user. And now I want to show you and other user I.D.,

58
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.609 
uh, a twelve or five

59
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.229 
and we see its user ID, a twelve

60
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.699 
or five. The name of the user is the to one of our

61
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.499 
attendees in our education at these times and

62
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.489 
it was created in 2017.

63
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.109 
The date is seventy five means the

64
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.159 
end of March, beginning of April and the default group.

65
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.899 
Each and every user has to have at least one group and this is the default group

66
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.259 
is email twelve year, May 12th.

67
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.849 
And this is code for our EMA

68
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.529 
education, the twelve year long term education.

69
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.529 
And this is a group. Within the scope, we can also have some

70
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.569 
resources for this group and all the attendees

71
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.429 
and the users of this group have the possibility to access

72
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.839 
group resources, there are some other information.

73
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.489 
Again, I don't go into too much detail here because I don't

74
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.309 
want to do security education here.

75
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.629 
It's just to give you an impression what kind of information is available.

76
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.349 
And we just saw that the group is

77
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.529 
the user belongs to it was Imar Emma 12.

78
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.299 
So I given the list scope command and say to

79
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.039 
F please list me the information

80
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.479 
about the Imar 12

81
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.559 
group. And here you see information for group.

82
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.669 
This is a profile now in my superior group is

83
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.269 
Imar. You mean these are our e-mail users?

84
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.339 
See attendees in our education and the owner is

85
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.899 
also email you some information and you see,

86
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.289 
um, which user I.D.

87
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.539 
are connected to this group?

88
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.719 
And these are the users. Now, here again is our email.

89
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.529 
Twelve hour, five hour chat show you it's Sebastian Sebastian.

90
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.969 
And he belongs, of course, also to this 12

91
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.970 
group.

92
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.109 
Now, I want to show you that there is another possibility to manage

93
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.819 
users, and this is with Jacir and

94
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.309 
Patch Jobs, we have a special possibility in z/OS environment

95
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.319 
to give in to his old commands in Petch.

96
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.209 
That's what I want to show you.

97
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.609 
So I go to the

98
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.559 
data set list. Many look at the data set name level

99
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.509 
of another user I.D.

100
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.949 
with which we set up our environment.

101
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.459 
And here below I have the data set users

102
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.619 
to see A.l and

103
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.380 
I think I'd soon find one oh six

104
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.159 
is one six.

105
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.399 
And this is now a backstop, as you can see.

106
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.099 
But this is for batuque. The program is called it's called

107
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.709 
EKG or one.

108
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.209 
And this is nothing more than the terminal monitor program of two years old.

109
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.739 
So I invoked he is all here and with the with the

110
00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.139 
data definition name syste as in I can give in

111
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.469 
now TIAs all commands and Wante is all commands.

112
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.059 
Now is it is an abbreviation

113
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.919 
for Adcorp. With this command

114
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.599 
I add a group to F and the group name is Imar.

115
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.059 
Twelth, it's C Corp.

116
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.499 
I showed you before with our one of our attendee's Sebastian

117
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.239 
Vint and the superior group is Emmanual.

118
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.209 
We saw it already when we listed the profile and

119
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.558 
the information about this group is Imar 11 calls.

120
00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:42.439 
And we also have an obvious information.

121
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.479 
OMV, as is the abbreviation for Open MB's.

122
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.849 
It was the first implementation of Unix within z/OS.

123
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.099 
Today it's called Unique System Services.

124
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.689 
And for accessing unique system services, we have to have group IDs

125
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:04.399 
for group access and I'll show you afterwards it for user access.

126
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.559 
And in this case, a group ID in this case is now at

127
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.949 
two one seven oh three one five.

128
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.809 
And some other information about as example,

129
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.309 
what classes can be accessed

130
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.279 
by this group.

131
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.729 
And with this change, will we

132
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.790 
add a profile for the group Ima Drouth?

133
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.260 
I show you another two years or

134
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.069 
batch emails, one oh eight

135
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.569 
with this pet shop, we set up our

136
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:55.039 
user IDs in this case, for the matter of course, and I go

137
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.829 
to Imar twelve or five because we already know this user.

138
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.219 
We saw the profile before.

139
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.469 
This is a user command email.

140
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.599 
Twelve oh five is the user ID.

141
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.949 
So Default Group is Immortal's, the group.

142
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.460 
I just showed how it was

143
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.709 
implemented. And Sinem is this case Sebastian Wind,

144
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.149 
he has access to a certain log on procedure and

145
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.949 
so on. And here that I want to mention again is you ID

146
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.009 
it's Eweida for Unix Systems Services.

147
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.729 
In this case there are some more parameters.

148
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:42.439 
Also the home directory browser user belongs to when he accesses

149
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.839 
Unix system services and the site is called

150
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.319 
and some other information and one command that has nothing to do with

151
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.229 
luck. If it's a defined alias command, it's the Command

152
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.899 
and Access Method Services Command to

153
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.779 
to do an entry into the Master Catalog's.

154
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.279 
This is a master catalog, so it's one dot user cut-throat um

155
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.139 
falsies EMA and three

156
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.829 
the name is in this case is a high level qualifier

157
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.719 
of uh, in this case the user

158
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.209 
Imar five again it's Sebastiano and with

159
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.129 
this TIAs or jobs we implement.

160
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.639 
And set up our user I.D.

161
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.730 
for our causes.

162
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.539 
OK. I think that was it for this demonstration.

163
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.129 
Hope you enjoyed it. If you have any remarks or questions, please use,

164
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.869 
as always, our forum and see openHPI

165
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.399 
platform. Thank you very much for attending and see you in one

166
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.049 
of our next video clips.

1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.670 
the number of students in mooc's have increased a lot in the last year.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.170 
however, it is still a struggle to finish in the course.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.180 
today we are going to be sent a work in progress work in which

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.980 
we analyzed how an intervention based on predictive data can

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.480 
improve learners' passing rates.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.920 
In particular i'm going to present an intervention in which we provide teachers

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.690 
with a dashboard showing what was the dropout

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.130 
risk of the students in the course, divided in three groups

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.910 
high risk low or medium risk and low risk. and in addition we

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.790 
provided them with indicators of this the characteristics of this

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.340 
week risk groups. the average time per session the percentage

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.620 
of video lectures. the percentage of exercise done and the percentage

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.370 
of average time invested.

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.210 
in addition to that, we provide them with template with feedback message.

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.770 
they can support the students with indicating how they could potentially

16
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.910 
improve their strategies to become more successful in the course.

17
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.900 
for evaluating these we ran a pilot study with a MOOC of six

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.580 
weeks introduction to beta with two teachers in which they were

19
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.030 
asked to send a weekly message to students during two month

20
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.080 
periods meaning that we ran the course twice.

21
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.220 
for understanding whether our intervention was successful.

22
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.840 
we take the data of these students on this pilot

23
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.020 
period, and compare it with the students' activity of those

24
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.910 
registered in the same course. but one year before, so that we

25
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.480 
could compare whether the percentage raised evolve.

26
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.630 
and this is what we did. the first result is that analyzing

27
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.920 
the passing rate we observed that the intervention course doubled

28
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.180 
the percentage of students finishing successfully the course.

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.210 
in addition to that we also observed that

30
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.210 
those students that were leveled as medium risk students were

31
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.470 
higher in the intervention group compared with those in the pre intervention group.

32
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.080 
the second result is that we also observed that the probability of

33
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.210 
of staying in the medium risk group was higher in turn in the intervention.

34
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.720 
we also observed that for example the probability of staying

35
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.130 
the high risk was higher in the pre intervention.

36
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.270 
the probability of passing of being a high risk student to

37
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.560 
a low risk student was higher in the intervention.

38
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.650 
and that the probability of staying as part of the low risk

39
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.940 
students in the intervention group was also higher

40
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.970 
meaning that somehow this intervention worked to improve the passing rates.

41
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.110 
however, we cannot be complexing with these results,

42
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.260 
because the students were not exposed to this intervention randomly,

43
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.590 
so we cannot infer causality. and also the pilot study was conducting

44
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.670 
during the covid pandemic in which we observed a rising number of students.

45
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.740 
and this could buy us a result. to solve this,

46
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.900 
we would like to run the same analysis using data from previous years

47
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.890 
and compare these results in different periods of the years,

48
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.550 
to see if these results are mounting.

49
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.570 
so as i said this is a small step toward understanding what,

50
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.210 
how could be the impact of providing timely and personalized

51
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.990 
feedback based on predictive data in MOOCs. thank you very much.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.939 
We come to the last item on the programme, a keynote, but before that something is supposed to happen.

2
00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:14.050 
Which was hard to write into the programme, because this is a surprise.

3
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.539 
We have the tradition at HPI,

4
00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.039 
Colleagues, friends of the house,

5
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.850 
who are in any relationship, a good relationship with us, to become HPI Fellows.

6
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.570 
That's exactly what we want to do with Dr Mei Lin Fung,

7
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.609 
Please join me!

8
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.539 
Yeah, so we'll do the clapping when she gets the badge then.

9
00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.049 
You still have the slide where they are all shown?

10
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.759 
Mei Ling, please come to me.

11
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.100 
What is the reason to award her with this fellow

12
00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.640 
medal?

13
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.900 
First, I want to introduce your degree in Maths and Finance at the MIT Sloan school then pioneer in developing one

14
00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.260

15
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.540 
She head the chair of the IEEE pre-standard workshop group, ICSIM - Industry Connections Social Impact Measurement (IC19-002).

16
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.469 
And this is the main focus of your work. In the context,

17
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:45.489 
as it was mentioned with communities, she belongs to the steering committee of the World Economic Forum for Internet, for

18
00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:49.780 
all the leadership initiative of the UN

19
00:01:49.790 --> 00:02:02.060 
Equals set up, you had set up in US, in Singapore, that's your homeland, and UK woman in

20
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.750 
Tech Task Force.

21
00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.540 
These are very important activities.

22
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.310 
We also have it in Germany and we organized an event in August 2015.

23
00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:24.729 
She was co-founder and chair of the People Centered Internet, co-chair together with Vint Cerf, Vint Cerf is the father

24
00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:30.520 
of the internet, now Google's Internet Evangelist.

25
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:42.349 
He is also for a couple of years, he became HPI fellow because he did different activities with us and in this position we

26
00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.650 
came together in the context of the clean-IT.

27
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:56.479 
initiative of the Hasso Plattner Institute and Mei Lin helped to also bring awareness on the political level. on the

28
00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:09.289 
political level that at the end is needed to give such initiative power by, for example, developing standards or by designing

29
00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.689 
labels or other things.

30
00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:18.199 
So we worked together and together we had a clean-IT

31
00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:30.259 
policy paper which was for the G20 process, discussion process, which runs this year under the leadership of Indonesia.

32
00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:41.180 
It is part of the discussion process there and I also think it's not finally decided that we also become part of the discussion

33
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.310 
process of the preparation process already.

34
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:54.159 
Yes, but in the final discussion process of the German led G7 process which also runs this year.

35
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.969 
So here,

36
00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:07.150 
I have this hidden, I want to declare you to become an HPI fellow.

37
00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:15.639 
Yeah, if you alow!

38
00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.149 
Okay.

39
00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:44.689 
So now you have to stop the applauses because I see you are asked to give a keynote and not to

40
00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.860 
upset you!

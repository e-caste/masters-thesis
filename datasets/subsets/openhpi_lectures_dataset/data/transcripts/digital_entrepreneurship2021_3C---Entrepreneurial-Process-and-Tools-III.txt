00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.429 
Welcome back. Now, today is the last part of our

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.517 
entrepreneurial process, instruments and methods, and you might

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.579 
remember in last session, I promised you we will now

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.599 
cover the last part of the entrepreneurial process.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.589 
It's actually about building a solution and making sure

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.980 
that a solution fits to the market.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.246 
So now it's really about building the business you might have been waiting for quite

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.870 
a long time.

9
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.109 
So what is this last part about?

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.999 
It's about reaching a final solution, and the way we do this

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.709 
is in a process that is by now called the lean startup.

12
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.569 
And the lean startup actually combines a multitude of different

13
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.236 
instruments in making sure to have

14
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.079 
a marketable solution.

15
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.350 
And you see some of them mentioned here.

16
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.999 
So the build, measure, learn framework, the scrum framework

17
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.620 
that actually is the foundation of agile development of those

18
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.359 
quick iterative sprints, making sure that you have

19
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.909 
something that is actually worthwhile pursuing.

20
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.769 
And it's about the business model canvas, a word you might have heard before.

21
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.840 
So how does it all fit together?

22
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.879 
The principles of the lean startup are quite simple.

23
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.510 
First, entrepreneurs are everywhere.

24
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.024 
Second, entrepreneurship is management, and you might remember that question

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.200 
about is entrepreneurship something you can learn?

26
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.790 
You can measure? Well, yes, part of it.

27
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.622 
Third, it's about validating learning processes.

28
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.220 
So you conduct experiments to actually test your assumptions.

29
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.389 
And this, again, might come a little bit as a surprise for you that, oh,

30
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.644 
we actually validate our learning, but I'll cover that in a little

31
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.709 
while. And the fourth principle is exactly the cycle

32
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.709 
of building, measuring, learning.

33
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.029 
And you see that it all fits together where you build your

34
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.779 
product or service. You then have an experiment and this is what

35
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.259 
your goal is to actually put your ideas into a product.

36
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.059 
We also call that a pivot.

37
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.070 
You measure your success or your not success,

38
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.642 
and then you start again. And it's all about really prioritizing your time and

39
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.539 
your task. And this is quite crucial for an entrepreneur.

40
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.750 
So let's see how those four things actually evolve.

41
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.138 
And I already mentioned that you use different tools in this lean startup process.

42
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.509 
You use the business model canvas, you use the principle of customer

43
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.139 
development that you can actually develop a customer,

44
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.869 
remember, in design thinking I told you it's about recognizing the user needs.

45
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.209 
It's about understanding the customer.

46
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.749 
And now I'm telling you, you can actually develop a customer.

47
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.900 
That's a little puzzling, isn't it? But we'll come to that.

48
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.999 
And the third principle, the agile engineering, it's this iterative, it's this quick

49
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.529 
building, and just doing.

50
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.629 
So, putting this all together leads you through that

51
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.510 
lean startup philosophy.

52
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.639 
We're not going into detail in the business model canvas because that,

53
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.300 
again, could cover at least a whole session.

54
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.426 
So if you're interested, there is some more literature on what actually the business

55
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.058 
model canvas is, what it does and how you use it to sketch out

56
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.289 
your hypothesis. You then go into the customer

57
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.759 
development, and this was the little riddle I gave you.

58
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.180 
So we understand users and now we develop them.

59
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.919 
But this is exactly what it is. And the founding father of the Lean

60
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.889 
Startup principle Steve Blank, once said no business

61
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.820 
and no business plan actually survives the first contact with the customers, you

62
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.800 
need to get out of the building and talk to your customer.

63
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.250 
And here you see that actually is also one of the principles of design

64
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:23.089 
thinking. Go out, ask people what

65
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.839 
they think about your idea and the way you're doing this.

66
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.039 
And this is now where it is different from the design thinking, remember I told you in

67
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.730 
design thinking it's about understanding the problem and it's about observing.

68
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.760 
Now, you have done this observation.

69
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.459 
You have already developed your first ideas.

70
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.576 
We're now in the third part of that entrepreneurial process and you have assumptions

71
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.124 
about the jobs to be done, what people want to

72
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.040 
do with your product, your service.

73
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.884 
It's about their pains and gains. And you take those assumptions and you ask

74
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.240 
your customer, what's your biggest headache?

75
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.910 
What's your biggest pain? How can I help?

76
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.449 
And in this interaction with potential users and customers,

77
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.759 
you listen, you learn, and then you go back and you update

78
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.847 
your assumptions. And here you see that again is the scientific

79
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.777 
approach, because we use the data

80
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.344 
we collected in those interviews and we put them back to

81
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.336 
our assumptions. So then we know these assumptions are confirmed, these

82
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.549 
are not. So it's a learning process and this helps

83
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.860 
you to then check again and build a first prototype

84
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.294 
to actually see and tell the customer, is this

85
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.339 
really your problem? And this is actually a crucial step because in many

86
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.369 
times the customer tells you something.

87
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.980 
And at that point in time, this person thinks that this is really their problem.

88
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.700 
Now, you have gone through that process.

89
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.349 
You have your assumptions, you validated your assumptions.

90
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.000 
You're building a first prototype in a prototype can just be a little piece of paper.

91
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.799 
And you go back to that customer and you check with them and ask

92
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.649 
them, that's the solution, address your problem.

93
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.550 
And many times the customer will tell you.

94
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.459 
Oh, this is what I told you, right?

95
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.320 
Actually, this is not my problem, actually, my problem is completely different.

96
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.569 
So this step of prototyping and then checking again with a customer

97
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.720 
is very crucial in your entrepreneurial process.

98
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.649 
And this already starts this Agile product development.

99
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.769 
We are iterating quickly. Right. So we're jumping back.

100
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.210 
We're developing a new idea or maybe just a slightly different version

101
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.949 
of our prototype and then we check back with the customer.

102
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.869 
So what you see, this whole notion of validating,

103
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.647 
learning, testing and again and again, the scientific

104
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.532 
approach to collect enough data to actually make decisions

105
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.709 
that are based in data.

106
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.454 
This is what the lean startup is about, and you see that along that process,

107
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.269 
using interviews, surveys, videos, experiments,

108
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.949 
the prototyping, then a split testing, for example, using an A B landing

109
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.629 
page or you name it.

110
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.519 
That all helps you from coming, just having an

111
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.970 
idea or maybe a solution to a problem to a minimum

112
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.448 
viable product MVP, as you can see on the slide, to actually a

113
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.119 
real product, which you then can accelerate.

114
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.489 
But you're using the same process over and over of discovering,

115
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.720 
validating, learning and then growing and optimizing.

116
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.809 
So this really, really brave and quick introduction

117
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.279 
into the lean startup approach has hopefully shown you that the

118
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.779 
entrepreneurial process, although we tried to actually split it in different

119
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.830 
phases, is very closely interrelated.

120
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.218 
But applying a foresight perspective, then

121
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.347 
a design thinking perspective and a lean startup will

122
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.880 
help you not only in digital entrepreneurship, but

123
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.639 
in all endeavors you might hope you might be willing to

124
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.510 
do in the future to actually come from nothing to something.

125
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.885 
So try it out, check our materials if you want to learn

126
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.659 
more about each and every one of these steps.

127
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.830 
And I'm looking forward to welcome you back to the next session.

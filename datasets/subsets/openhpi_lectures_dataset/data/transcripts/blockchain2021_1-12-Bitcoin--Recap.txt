1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.780 
Let's have a recap about the
bitcoin system in our openHPI course

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.900 
"Blockchain:
Revealing the Myth".

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.700 
In compact seven steps we have covered
the complete complex bitcoin solution.

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.640 
There was a lot to do,
many different things

5
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.230 
and we need to understand this
to get a better understanding

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.990 
about what the blockchain technology
provides and how it works.

7
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.930 
And in this explanation we
started with the origin problem.

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.390 
The origin problem was "How can
we take advantage of paying

9
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.430 
by physical currency on the
Internet without a trusted third party?"

10
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.740 
Today this is only possible
by means of banks and

11
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.500 
intermediaries from the financial
world and we want to do this by

12
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.870 
cryptographic
technologies

13
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.860 
in a direct peer to
peer interactions.

14
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.720 
Then we could continued with
concrete individual solutions.

15
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.610 
We showed what is a
framework of coins,

16
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.240 
framework of coins which are a
sequence of digital signatures,

17
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.380 
we introduced a system for participants to
agree on a single chronological order

18
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.100 
in which the transactions received
to give a common understanding

19
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.470 
in this distributed world, in this
world where also malicious user

20
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.750 
are working to provide a common
truce and this common truce

21
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.340 
is a single chronological
order of the transaction.

22
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.590 
We solved the problem to
prevent double spending

23
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.520 
in our peer-to-peer system, we did it by means
of timestamping techniques and hashing

24
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.940 
and we considered how users
can be incentivized

25
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.010 
to comply with the rules and
to provide proof of work to

26
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.350 
run the bitcoin system. And then
finally we gave some ideas

27
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.230 
how the bitcoin system

28
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.020 
were made more flexible.

29
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.100 
Now let's consider what is the
advantage what is the disadvantage

30
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.520 
what have we reached with
the bitcoin system.

31
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.030 
Here it's important to see as
well the user's perspective as

32
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.160 
well as the system's perspective on
the advantage of the bitcoin system.

33
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.190 
So let's start with
the user perspective.

34
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.730 
For the user an electronic
payment system is provided

35
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.580 
which allows any two willing parties
to transact directly with each other

36
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.320 
without the need of a trusted party, without
the need of a bank or anyone else.

37
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.870 
The users they do not meet,
they do not have to meet

38
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.510 
any conditions
joining the systems.

39
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.370 
There is not a special check,
there is not the identity

40
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.650 
requested or others. Without any
conditions they user can meet

41
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.680 
the system and can leave
it whenever they want.

42
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.960 
To use the bitcoin systems, the
users only need to use

43
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.260 
the corresponding app.

44
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.900 
The corresponding app -

45
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.450 
there are two versions, one for the full
users and one for the lightweight users

46
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.050 
and beside containing all rules and
functions, the app also has a database

47
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.750 
with a copy of all resources.
For the full users these are all

48
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.930 
the blocks with the transactions and
for the lightweight user these are

49
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.720 
only the block headers with
the respective transactions.

50
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.720 
And then when users join or
when users rejoin the system,

51
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.540 
the database is updated
by simply uploading

52
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.740 
the missing information.

53
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.900 
In this way the app
communicates with all other

54
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.130 
users apps, all data are
exchanged, transactions blocks

55
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.960 
and such things, the data
are checked and saved.

56
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.010 
This is what's done on side
of the full users and then

57
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.850 
the system is running.

58
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.760 
The user is not aware of the details that
happened in the past, all this complex

59
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.890 
checking, proof of work
and other things

60
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.000 
is done by this app.

61
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.720 
The users are flexible in the
choice under which conditions

62
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.350 
bitcoin may be spent.

63
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.950 
This is also an advantage of the user's
perspective from the user's perspective

64
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.480 
of the bitcoin system.

65
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.490 
The users can earn money. They can earn
money by supporting the system

66
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:38.730 
to run and by spending CPU time
to give a work of proof by

67
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.500 
creating a new block for
creating new brook

68
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:49.310 
this was the core based transaction and the
earning from eventually transaction fee

69
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.820 
when their block

70
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.100 
becomes part of the
longest chain.

71
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
And then the users can be sure
that as long as most of the CPU

72
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.510 
power in the network is in
the hand of honest users,

73
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.780 
the majority most of the CPU power is
in the hands of honest users,

74
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.620 
the system will remain
free from fraud.

75
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.890 
Independent of third parties and
as resistant of censorship,

76
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.560 
nobody knows who are the users
nobody knows who is the

77
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.700 
person behind the address of a
receiver of a transaction, so

78
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.970 
third parties are
not involved and

79
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.050 
censorship is
not possible.

80
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.250 
This is the requirement. Most of
CPU power is in the hand

81
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.220 
of honest users, you remember
most of the number of users most

82
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:59.650 
of the IP addresses this is not a good basis
for majority decisions because it's simple

83
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.420 
for fraud, for
malicious users

84
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:13.430 
to cheat by taking many
many IP addresses for themself

85
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.390 
and let the
other user think

86
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.870 
that there's many users.

87
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.770 
If we look from the
system perspective,

88
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.570 
there are also a lot of advantages of
the bitcoin system. Let's start with

89
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.030 
the system perspective
on the network.

90
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.470 
So it's a system for electronic
transactions without relying on trust,

91
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.250 
works here the
network is robust.

92
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.570 
It is unstructured,
it is very simple

93
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:57.520 
to provide, users work all at once
with little coordination,

94
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.430 
there is a kind of
competition to earn the

95
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.160 
coins which are mined

96
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:13.980 
in the code based transaction, so for
the administrator systems runs well.

97
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.040 
They do not need to be identified
since messages are not routed

98
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.830 
to any particular place.

99
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.240 
Neither the users nor
the administrators

100
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.390 
no administrators are

101
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.260 
needed. The users

102
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.940 
have this peer to peer network,
they can work together, no one

103
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.190 
needs to be identified. And
users can easily leave

104
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.890 
and rejoin the network at will accepting
the current state of the system.

105
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.090 
The current state is described
as a longest chain as proof

106
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.870 
of what happened while
they were gone.

107
00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.020 
If we mention the advantages
from a system perspective

108
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.930 
with respect
to the order

109
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.350 
to avoid missing transactions all
transactions are publicly announced.

110
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.520 
This is a basis of the
bitcoin system.

111
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.480 
In a trust based system this
regulation

112
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.360 
is only possible by a central
authority. The user do not see

113
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.950 
the other transactions of other users.
Here in the bitcoin system everyone,

114
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.830 
every user can see
every transaction.

115
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.830 
The chronographical
linking of the contents

116
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.360 
determines the single chronological
order in which the contents, in

117
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.990 
bitcoin its transactions and bitcoin
content is blocks were received.

118
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.420 
And this order which
is cryptographically

119
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.860 
linked, the different
blocks the order of the blocks

120
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.910 
that give the truth of what
happened in the system, what kind

121
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:10.600 
of transactions are done, what
bitcoin are free to be spent.

122
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.410 
For producing the
single chronological order

123
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:21.740 
the users votewith their CPU power
by providing a proof of work.

124
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.110 
A proof of work needs to be
invested to form a block,

125
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.630 
forming a block one
can have a chance to

126
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.620 
bitcoins then the block becomes
part of the longest chain

127
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.710 
and the proof of work consists
in solving a very difficult

128
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.500 
computation, a question,

129
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:52.690 
you remember this was to find a
hash value of the block, hash

130
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.510 
of the block and a nonce which
was below of the target so

131
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.380 
that it needs about ten minutes
to produce such a new

132
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:07.860 
block. So the correct order will then
be the one with the most votes.

133
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:17.370 
This is the longest chain and it is proved
by that here in this longest chains

134
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.390 
the greatest proof of work
effort was invested.

135
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.540 
This work deters the attackers
as they have to redo

136
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.690 
the same work. So they ought
to find it more profitable

137
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:38.350 
to play with the rules instead of
trying to generate new

138
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:45.060 
blocks with fake transactions
because they have to manage to

139
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.820 
reform and bring their fake
blocks to make them part of the

140
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:58.110 
longest chain. This is quiet impossible
as long as the majority of the CPU power

141
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.890 
is in the hand of
the honest user.

142
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.780 
Then the system is secure as long
as the honest nodes collectively

143
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.670 
control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attackers.

144
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.700 
This is a pre
assumption

145
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.340 
and this all the mechanisms
provided and implemented in

146
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.680 
the bitcoin system are
based on that assumption.

147
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.370 
And then if we look for the
advantage of the bitcoin system

148
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:36.100 
bitcoin system from the system
perspective, also the framework of coins

149
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:44.440 
provides a lot of advantages. Coins are
made from digital signatures. So coins

150
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:51.790 
are a sequence of digital signatures
of which proof what was

151
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:57.950 
done with this coin by the different
users. So it gives a strong control

152
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.500 
of the ownership of the
values behind the coin.

153
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.880 
So the coin in the system has a
property of being spent or unspent

154
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:15.680 
the active coins are represented
by UTXOs, these were the unspent

155
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.210 
coins and the coins are
reminded decentrally.

156
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.620 
So the bitcoin system

157
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.320 
consists of separate
individual segments,

158
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.900 
there is a permissionless peer to peer network
there is a security consensus through

159
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:43.980 
proof of work. There are the transparent
order of the contents in this proof

160
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.880 
and there are
frameworks of coins.

161
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.280 
After having understood
the block chain system,

162
00:13:53.870 --> 00:14:00.870 
we can step back in the beginning when we
asked how to define block chain technology.

163
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.720 
Blockchain technology that is
not bitcoin. Bitcoin system

164
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.050 
is based on blockchain,
block chain technology

165
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:17.220 
allows bitcoin to work in this
way as we have described. So

166
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.770 
let's try to define the underlying
technology of the bitcoin system

167
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:31.020 
and moving away from the field
of cyber currencies because

168
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.230 
this blockchain technology can be
applied in many different other areas

169
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.910 
with the same success.

170
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.250 
Here we invite you to share
your ideas on a definition

171
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.280 
and you share your ideas
with other learners

172
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.920 
of our openHPI course. Please go
into the forum and discuss

173
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.820 
what you have
understood,

174
00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.170 
what you have understood when
we speak about blockchain.

175
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:06.900 
Here a definition, this is coming
up from what we have learned

176
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:13.930 
from the bitcoin system and this says
the blockchain technology provides

177
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.830 
permissionless peer
to peer network.

178
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.130 
By using of work

179
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.930 
that means solving a difficult
questions in our case

180
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.590 
there could be other

181
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:36.920 
things to apply block chain technology
to record a public history of contents.

182
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.540 
In our case the contents were
transactions and blocks,

183
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.210 
in other contents it
may be other things

184
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:49.760 
that quickly comes computationally
impractical for an attacker

185
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:56.360 
to change if honest nodes control
the majority of CPU power.

186
00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.570 
This is very important because
we have no judgment in our

187
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.360 
network. We have no
mediator, we have no

188
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.810 
trusted third party. Everyone distrusts
everyone else and nevertheless

189
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.180 
we need a common truth
computationally that is difficult

190
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.340 
to break difficult
to sheet.

191
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:30.080 
All is done without any trusted
third party, does not require trust

192
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:36.420 
between the peers. So this is what we have
learned from the bitcoin systems - the

193
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:43.060 
importance of the bitcoin system
is to provide a successful

194
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.470 
application which proves that
this technology is working.

195
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:55.130 
To summarize up, I congratulate
you that you have made it

196
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.460 
this far. It's
really complex

197
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.460 
and it's a huge system.

198
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.450 
The bitcoin system after
grasping the bitcoin system now

199
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.700 
we move to other application areas. We
will see how they can be disrupted

200
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:19.560 
by blockchain technology similarly like

201
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:26.430 
a financial industry was disrupted or is
disrupted by the blockchain technology

202
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:34.310 
and by cryptocurrency and what we do,
this bitcoin system was the beginning

203
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.690 
of the blockchain technique. Meanwhile
in the last ten years a lot

204
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:45.680 
of evolution happens
with the blockchain technology,

205
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.540 
with its use in other areas. So it
came meanwhile the role into

206
00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.520 
the role of a decentralized world
computer but more in the next

207
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.970 
clip and in the
next week of our openHPI course.

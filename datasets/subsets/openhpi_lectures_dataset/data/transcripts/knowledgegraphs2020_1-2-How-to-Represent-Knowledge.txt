00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.860 
This is Knowledge Graphs lecture
number 1, knowledge graphs

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.710 
in the web of data. In this part
of the lecture, we are going

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.850 
to ask ourself how can we
represent knowledge?

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.300 
So you might remember from
the last lecture 33.6

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.430 
is just a number, just a data point, we
have no idea what exactly it means.

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.410 
As soon as I give you more information
like for example meters,

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.840 
then we might already know okay so this
data means this is kind of a length.

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.910 
But the length of what? For that
we need even more information

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.550 
like 33.6 meters is the
length of a Blue Whale.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.910 
However, we might want to express
much more knowledge connected

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.660 
to the single data point which, of
course, is already implicitly there

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.020 
in the term blue whale
for example. So,

13
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.320 
what we are going to do is we want to
express more information, more knowledge.

14
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.900 
For example, a blue whale is
a specific kind of whale,

15
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.790 
and the whale is a mammal and
mammal, of course, is an animal.

16
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.390 
We know that whales live
in the oceans, and we

17
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.240 
know an ocean is a
body of water.

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.630 
However, we could also talk about
a rather specific blue whale

19
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.680 
that we know personally. So let's
talk for example, about Moby

20
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.450 
and Moby is a specific blue whale. He
lives in the Atlantic ocean for example.

21
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.180 
So let's go back to
our data point 33.6,

22
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.290 
we know that the longest ever
measured blue whale had a length

23
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.870 
of 33.6 meters.

24
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.410 
What does that mean? This
means that up to now

25
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.590 
and unless we may
find a longer one

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.500 
the largest blue whale ever
measured was 33.6 meters,

27
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.030 
or this also means that no blue
whale is longer than 33.6

28
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.490 
meters.

29
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.180 
Which also means, we can deduce
that simply by the simple

30
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.970 
fact, if Moby is a specific blue whale
we can deduce that moby is also

31
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.140 
not longer than
33.6 meters.

32
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.940 
And if you happen to
find a longer whale

33
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.650 
then either it is not a blue whale or we
have to change our previous assumptions.

34
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.340 
So this is all knowledge and you
see what we are able to express.

35
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.490 
How did we
express that?

36
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.840 
we were using language, natural
language, english language. So

37
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.480 
for example, we can say now
natural language is a way

38
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.800 
to represent knowledge and we
will see it's a specific

39
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.090 
way to do that, but not
necessarily the best one.

40
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
I will tell you why this is the
case but first, we have to define

41
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.870 
of course, what is natural
language? So what is language?

42
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.090 
Language by definition is a system of
conventional spoken, manual, or written symbols

43
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.650 
that combine to convey meaning
and by means of which we human

44
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.870 
beings as members of a social group
and participants in a culture,

45
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260 
we express ourselves with
it, so this is language.

46
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.130 
And one of the most important functions
of language that is also clear,

47
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.290 
that is communication.

48
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.270 
How does language and
communication work?

49
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.910 
rather simple. So just assume that you
want to convey some information.

50
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.750 
So you have some information in
your mind and what you do is

51
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.610 
you are going to encode it into a
message, which means I'm a sender

52
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.450 
you are the receiver. So I'm trying to
transform my idea into spoken language

53
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.520 
and this language, the message, the
spoken language, is communicated

54
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.700 
across the communication channel
which is simply the air

55
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.170 
via speech. And the receiver, so
you are at home you received

56
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.410 
the message with the help of your
ear and it has to be decoded

57
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.230 
so your brain has to decode language
and by doing that of course,

58
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.450 
you can make several mistakes. So
there are several challenges

59
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.870 
in doing that, first of all, of
course, the communication channel

60
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.240 
might be noisy and there is
information loss. So just imagine,

61
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.360 
a room full of people speaking
with each other and you try

62
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.100 
to communicate with somebody
who is speaking rather low.

63
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.340 
That might be problematic so
you might not hear everything

64
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.370 
and understand everything, so this is the
first problem noise and information loss.

65
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.620 
Second problem
of course,

66
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.420 
my mindset and your mindset might
be completely different and

67
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.250 
then we have a problem either I do, if
I want to convey a message to you

68
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.770 
encoded insufficiently so that you are
not able really to understand it.

69
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.740 
Or you are going to decode in an
insufficient way that you are not able

70
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.050 
to find out what I was really thinking
and trying to convey, so you see

71
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.180 
communication is a rather difficult
problem and there are many challenges

72
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.010 
that have to be solved. But this is only
the communication process, we have more

73
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.230 
difficulties in language itself,
So how does it really work

74
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.950 
if we want to communicate the meaning
that we want to get across?

75
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.010 
Probably you have already seen
this kind of a triangle, this

76
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.930 
is called semiotic triangle.
It was introduced by

77
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.010 
Ogden and Richards in the
1920s, but dates back to the

78
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.180 
writings of Aristotle even.
So when we have a language,

79
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.690 
there we have symbols or the
words for example, and each of

80
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.980 
these symbols they stand for
objects in the real world. So for

81
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.700 
example, if I
say Jaguar,

82
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.340 
then this stands for a specific
object, so either I mean by that

83
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.900 
the car or the beast, or
you know I'm a computer

84
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.020 
scientist I also might mean a previous
version of the apple mac operating system.

85
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.040 
But you have no idea simply
by seeing that single word

86
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.220 
which of these
meanings I refer to.

87
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.170 
The other thing is, as soon as you
hear that symbol or read that symbol

88
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.000 
in your mind, the concept pops up.
So for some of you immediately

89
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.550 
the car was there for others of you
probably the beast was there,

90
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.350 
and only for a few of you, of course,
the operating system was there.

91
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.010 
However, successful communication
between receiver and sender

92
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.320 
is only possible if we are
talking about the same

93
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.150 
concept. So this uniqueness, it's
really important. Otherwise,

94
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.470 
we cannot talk about understanding and
communication or correct communication

95
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.330 
of meaning. So,

96
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.750 
what makes natural language so
difficult and it is already found

97
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.840 
out by Ferdinand de Saussure,
who is a rather famous

98
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.550 
linguist, a swiss linguist
from the 19th century and I

99
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.700 
let him see here a nice
sentence he says,

100
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.250 
I'm a linguist, I love language
more than most people.

101
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.590 
And you might already realise
that this kind of sentence I

102
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.290 
can interpret in
different ways. So

103
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.890 
you see the basic problem here is
2 fold with natural language.

104
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:31.330 
On the first hand, I am able to convey
exactly the same content, the same meaning,

105
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.590 
with different terms in different ways
with different sentences. So this first

106
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.480 
challenge means Paraphrasing,
I'm able to paraphrase.

107
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.010 
And the second thing, it's quite the
opposite which means the same term

108
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.890 
might have different meanings, you
remember Jaguar, so this has

109
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.470 
of course the meaning of the beast, the
car, and so on. So this is ambiguity,

110
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:01.600 
so paraphrasing and ambiguity not only
on the word level, but on multiple

111
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.020 
levels of abstraction make the
literal language so difficult and

112
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.350 
this is what linguists,
especially computer scientists

113
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.750 
who are working in natural
language processing have so much

114
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.530 
challenges to solve. So, therefore,
language is really difficult.

115
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.650 
What we are going to need
therefore instead of an informal

116
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.440 
knowledge representation like
language for the computer to

117
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.980 
make the computer understand
what we are meaning,

118
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.420 
we need a kind of formal knowledge
representation where we

119
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.120 
have really unique
representations for meanings.

120
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.490 
So this exactly we are going to try. So
what is formal knowledge representation?

121
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.740 
Usually, formal knowledge representation is
an entire field of Artificial Intelligence

122
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.110 
which and this is important,
unambiguously captures the semantics,

123
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:57.590 
which is the meaning of concepts of
properties of relations and entities,

124
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.460 
and these entities come from
specific knowledge domains,

125
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.710 
which means fields of interests
or areas of concern.

126
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.610 
And they want to represent this
as structured data because

127
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.120 
computers are able to understand
structured data, so this is

128
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.070 
what formal knowledge
representations are going to do.

129
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.760 
Important here is that machines,
so we're talking about computers

130
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.390 
of course, in general, must be able to
understand formal knowledge representations,

131
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.120 
not only to be able to read them
like you know a password is

132
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:34.470 
able to read HTML or something like
that. Now this is about understanding,

133
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.010 
and what does understanding mean in
that case, or in that perspective?

134
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.820 
For us to understand a
knowledge representation

135
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:52.510 
the machine must be able to interpret it
correctly and to act consequently correctly,

136
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.650 
so the correct interpretation is essential
for understanding if I interpret

137
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:05.000 
a message or whatever in a wrong way then,
of course, I did not understand it. So

138
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.000 
correct interpretation, keep this in mind
this is really really really important.

139
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.900 
Therefore in the next part of the
lecture we are going to ask

140
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.590 
ourselves how does this understanding
works in the art of understanding?

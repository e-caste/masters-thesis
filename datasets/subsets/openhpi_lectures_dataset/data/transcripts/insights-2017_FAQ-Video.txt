Hi there! This video shall help you to navigate

2
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:12.120 
through the openHPI

3
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:16.070 
platform. I'll give you some technical and helpful tips

4
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:18.010 
what you need for this MOOC.

5
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:23.070 
So let's start on the general

6
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.580 
course page where you can find the general

7
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:27.060 
course structure on the left.

8
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.840 
Each week you can see a row of icons

9
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:33.270 
right next to the general course structure

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.170 
indicating the weekly structure.

11
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:39.600 
The icons illustrate the process line of your learning

12
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.280 
and stand for the corresponding learning material.

13
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:45.510 
Here is a list explaining all items.

14
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.700 
You might also want to adjust the emails

15
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:54.050 
you get from the course

16
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:55.890 
according to your personal needs.

17
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.800 
Let me show you how you can change your email notification settings.

18
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.960 
You can do this by clicking on this button.

19
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.350 
For example, openHPI’s

20
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:10.740 
automatic setting is to send you an email notification

21
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:13.910 
each time someone posts to the discussion forum.

22
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:16.940 
You can turn off this function here.

23
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:22.180 
Throughout the course

24
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.780 
we’ll provide you with templates for exercises

25
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:25.670 
and assignments.

26
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:27.830 
Please consider these as optional

27
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:29.800 
and feel free to design your own ones.

28
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.890 
You should only make sure that

29
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.600 
the categories are the same ones to help your peers

30
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:35.540 
review your work.

31
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.520 
All videos have a subtitle function

32
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:43.660 
which you can find below the video frame.

33
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:47.220 
You can either display subtitles within the video

34
00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:49.600 
by clicking on the closed captions button,

35
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.980 
or you can read the video script

36
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:53.280 
by clicking on the list

37
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:56.940 
icon next to it. To switch off the subtitle function,

38
00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:58.650 
just click the icons again.

39
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.330

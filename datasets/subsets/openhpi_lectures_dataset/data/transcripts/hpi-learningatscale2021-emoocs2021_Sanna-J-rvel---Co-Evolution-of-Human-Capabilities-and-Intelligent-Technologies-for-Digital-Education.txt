00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.650 
My talk is about co-evolution of human capabilities and intelligent technologies for

2
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.340 
digital education. My name is Sanna Järvelä and I'm a professor

3
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.310 
in learning sciences and educational technology at the University

4
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.390 
of Oulu, Finland.

5
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.390 
In my talk, I would first like to start discussing about what

6
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.820 
kind of skills and competencies are needed for the future, especially

7
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.400 
reflecting about the recent changes in our society.

8
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.700 
And especially thinking about the digitalisation perspective.

9
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.750 
Since I am a learning scientist

10
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.850 
I would like to build my arguments on my own research

11
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.990 
and I need to stress few issues about what do we know how people learn.

12
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.340 
And especially going to stress about a need for regulation in learning.

13
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.020 
I will discuss about the co-evolution of human capabilities and intelligent technologies

14
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.610 
and I would like to end my talk about a bigger perspective and propose that

15
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.960 
human sciences in general should be more active and participating and shaping

16
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.240 
digitalisation.

17
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.240 
I would like to start with this picture

18
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.100 
pointing out that we are currently balancing these two worlds.

19
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.830 
On one hand our life is changing quite a lot about all this

20
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.420 
things digitalisation is bringing to our teaching and learning

21
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.730 
and education and everyday life. All these adaptive support by the

22
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.570 
algorithms and artificial intelligence and all these patterns

23
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.710 
and models and efficiency that technology can give us.

24
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.820 
But on one hand,

25
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.190 
we as humans have not really changed it that much something very unique, we

26
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.870 
have, as being humans, like being able to metacognitively

27
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.620 
monitor our minds,

28
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.300 
being able to be flexible in our thinking and create,

29
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.130 
our ability to participate on socio-emotional communication and interpret interactions

30
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.130 
and also all these emotional and motivational issues that we

31
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.000 
as humans are able to express and also interpret in interactions.

32
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.140 
So, how we balancing these two worlds is a so big issue and

33
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.050 
I think we should take all the power of these two worlds

34
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.990 
to breeds them to break traditional boundaries of learning how we learn

35
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.930 
but also work hard for more bold and ambitious implications,

36
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.130 
for supporting and increasing human competencies for the twenty

37
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.330 
first century.

38
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.220 
Still the fact is that

39
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.660 
digitalisation and all these automation and artificial intelligence,

40
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.810 
it will shape our workplaces and this is something

41
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.840 
we should consider in details in our current education

42
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.410 
because the skills needed already now but especially in few years

43
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.100 
in different

44
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.940 
positions and tasks and workplaces are very different, since

45
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.270 
there are a lot of jobs for example that we don't still know.

46
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.600 
And it is quite clear that

47
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.590 
we are in new formations of learning and education.

48
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.720 
This is something which is changing and we have to participate on that.

49
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.920 
Also the skills and knowledge learnt in education need to change

50
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.250 
and I am pointing out here for example to

51
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.970 
interdisciplinary intelligence,

52
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.390 
something needed to be trained in education so that

53
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.640 
the students who are now studying are capable and participating

54
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.430 
to collaborate and and work together with different disciplines

55
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.470 
and people to solve future problems.

56
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.980 
I'm pointing to hot cognition,

57
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.990 
something what I contrast to cold cognition.

58
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.540 
I am pointing to emotion effects, motivational issues those

59
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.630 
very unique human competencies.

60
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.190 
pPobably more important in future than only

61
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.170 
putting focus on cognition and knowledge and understanding.

62
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.330 
Also human capability for metacognition and meta-knowing

63
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.030 
knowing what we know, knowing how we feel

64
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.740 
is very important.

65
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.140 
And it seems that we are currently

66
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.760 
working hard to find out ways how we can keep on education

67
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.850 
in different conditions and all these kind of future ongoing learning models

68
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.970 
are currently under explorations and we

69
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.140 
really need to develop those more.

70
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.790 
One issue which I have to mention of course is the year and

71
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.610 
the year and a half we have been living through.

72
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.230 
But I would like to point out that even though of course

73
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.520 
our pandemic has been a very serious health crises but it has also

74
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.240 
been a global work and educational crisis.

75
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.700 
And it has pushed our way to develop more flexible ways

76
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.690 
to organize education and the places and context and technologies

77
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.410 
where people learn.

78
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.460 
But the deeper question we have to think currently is that how and what

79
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.460 
to educate and train in this uncertain world

80
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.060 
for a future that we really can't predict.

81
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.700 
My answer for this question is that

82
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:50.810 
we should consider a new set of uniquely human skills and competencies, those that

83
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.750 
that our technologies masses or our artificial intelligence cannot replicate

84
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.450 
because we have to empower humans

85
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:09.220 
and I have four issues which I think are are important from my research perspective.

86
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.230 
First of all one of the critical skill is ability to adapt

87
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.410 
to new situations and challenges and help people to learn how to engage

88
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.180 
in complex problem solving together with other learners.

89
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.910 
Secondly, since communication, collaboration and interactions

90
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.170 
are so important in between humans, social skills necessarily

91
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.880 
for communicating and collaborating productively and proficiency

92
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.870 
is an important future skill.

93
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.410 
Thirdly, socio-emotional skills and empathy for example

94
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.220 
is something which empowers humans and they are necessarily

95
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.170 
tackling challenging problems, so that the tolerance of being

96
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:05.410 
and engaging being part and keep on working is still

97
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.510 
valid and exists.

98
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:17.020 
And fourth, human agency needs training. This is an ability to take

99
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.990 
initiative, set goals and and also monitor

100
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.350 
how we are able to progress to active the goals by ourself,

101
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.950 
but also with the other people.

102
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.970 
So being a learning scientist, I build on my understanding

103
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.760 
to our current research and

104
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:48.270 
I have to stress something very fundamental and something very core

105
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.020 
process in human learning and that is metacognition.

106
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.210 
Metacognition is something which helps you

107
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.390 
being a kind of little learning scientist in your mind,

108
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.610 
kind of experimenting with your own learning.

109
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.930 
Metacognition is ability that we as humans only have and

110
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.670 
therefore we can monitor

111
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.840 
what do we know, how do we learn, kind of scan our internal and external

112
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.630 
factors, our existing knowledge and something which we don't understand.

113
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.150 
All the resources our environment and how they could help our

114
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.910 
understanding.

115
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.830 
And the best ability with the metacognition is that that makes

116
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:42.640 
us aware about those missing issues and gaps and then

117
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.670 
it helps us to regulate and adapt.

118
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.790 
So we have a theory which is

119
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.960 
old but very strong and it is called self-regulated learning theory.

120
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.980 
Self-regulated learning theory is something which

121
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:09.440 
actually describes those issues I just described. It describes

122
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:15.960 
the active and proactive learning, active mind, how active mind works.

123
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:24.060 
Already decades of very strong research on self-regulated learning

124
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.500 
has evidence that those learners who are able to self regulate their learning

125
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.310 
usually succeed in their learning.

126
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.540 
And the self regulated learning theory describes the process

127
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.880 
of learning how you monitor, evaluate and regulate your own thinking,

128
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:48.350 
your own motivation, emotion, behavior and ultimately your learning process.

129
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.360 
A very good thing is that

130
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.480 
we know from research that self regulated learning is an adaptive

131
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.680 
process that you can develop and refine over time. So

132
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.030 
this is something you can always train and

133
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.690 
develop from the very early

134
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.580 
years but keep on developing until the old age.

135
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.810 
Self regulation is a kind of cycle in your mind. So, basically this

136
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.740 
describing the process that how we can approach in a strategy and

137
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.070 
a way to progress in our learning and how we can make adaptive

138
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.920 
changes in terms of our cognition, motivation and emotion

139
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.690 
and metacognitive monitoring. This is something which is

140
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.970 
observing our task, understanding and how do we set goals and

141
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.940 
how do we enact our strategies. And then according to monitor

142
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.710 
adaptive changes, if something goes wrong.

143
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.050 
But self-regulated theory is

144
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.260 
rather individual

145
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:06.420 
perspective on how people learn and therefore

146
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.360 
it is important to consider

147
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.440 
collaborative learning.

148
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.710 
We know that collaborative learning is a very prominent model

149
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.390 
for learning. It is in the best cases a very successful learning model

150
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.610 
but we also know that

151
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.800 
it is quite hard and quite often

152
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.050 
groups also fail.

153
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.830 
Mainly because the collaborative learning

154
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.240 
consists of rather demanding mental

155
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.780 
processes in social interaction.

156
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.390 
In the best cases, it consists of socio-emotional interactions, transactions

157
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.530 
and knowledge building processes in between

158
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.030 
the learners

159
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.650 
and in the best cases

160
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.470 
they are successfully shared in between collaborating partners.

161
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:12.300 
Therefore, collaborative learning is a complex process, always in learning situation

162
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.580 
issues dealing with cognition motivation affect

163
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.270 
emotion and metacognition are playing a role.

164
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.940 
It's never only a cognitive knowledge building process

165
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.970 
but in collaborative learning this is something which goes on

166
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.130 
in between other people, other learners and their interpretations

167
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.280 
and existing understanding knowledge.

168
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.600 
And also in these days always with various kind of technologies

169
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.980 
and contextual affordances.

170
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.340 
So understanding collaborative learning and supporting collaborative learning,

171
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.960 
we should understand all this complexities.

172
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.170 
Therefore I have been working together with my research group

173
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.850 
to extend these self-regulated learning theory

174
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.830 
in the social context and we have been considered

175
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.830 
a regulation in collaborative learning.

176
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.710 
According to our several empirical studies,

177
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.890 
we know that successful collaboration requires

178
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.450 
not only self-regulation, regulating oneself,

179
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:33.150 
but also co-regulation, supporting each others, supporting peers in a group.

180
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.440 
And ultimately regulating together, so

181
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.490 
activating socially self regulation processes.

182
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.990 
So, we know that achieving success in collaborative learning

183
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.980 
it depends on goal constructing, shared task representations,

184
00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.680 
shared goals and shared strategies but also regulating, learning

185
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.480 
by activating metacognitive monitoring and controlling the

186
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.270 
cognition, motivation, emotion and behavior in groups.

187
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:18.040 
So, then moving to the co-evolution of human capabilities and

188
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.710 
intelligent technologies.

189
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.310 
I have been working almost more than twenty years with different

190
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.610 
kind of educational technologies and still in this day,

191
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.490 
I haven't find any technology which is so intelligent that

192
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.610 
it can fluently help people to learn

193
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:44.880 
but it's always a matter of implementing technology which supports

194
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.470 
and activates students' minds and their learning

195
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.010 
processes. So therefore, we have to build

196
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.890 
implementing technologies to the knowledge how

197
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.820 
we know, how people understand and how people learn.

198
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.540 
This is something

199
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.250 
what we have been doing, of course, in global

200
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.270 
research during the past decades.

201
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.080 
About twenty years ago this co-evolution with computers and learners started with

202
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.300 
taking these wonderful machines called computers to the classrooms

203
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.250 
and during that time, we put one student working with the

204
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.890 
computer with different kind of learning programs.

205
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:39.260 
And the questions we asked was that how students learn by

206
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.280 
with and through computers.

207
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.940 
And thinking about the motivational, cognitive and social interactions

208
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.920 
issues the research progressed.

209
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.610 
And at the same time we were very aware about the role

210
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.960 
of the teacher and that research also contributed on thinking

211
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.960 
about the teacher's role in participating this computer

212
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.830 
based learning.

213
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.070 
When technology is developed and we had several kind of opportunities for developing these

214
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.090 
learning environments and network technologies,

215
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.910 
the focus moved on groups.

216
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:20.500 
And for example, computer supported collaborative learning

217
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.040 
has produced very many prominent ways to help

218
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.220 
learners to study globally and locally.

219
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:35.530 
So the question researchers started to work was how groups

220
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.250 
learn supported by various technologies.

221
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.280 
And we know quite a lot about collaborative knowledge building.

222
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.980 
We know how important it is to work for shared understanding

223
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.250 
and also we know quite a lot about group interaction processes.

224
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.090 
And therefore the role of the teacher to support

225
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.560 
was on designing and scripting and orchestrating this

226
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.850 
collaborative and group processes with technologies.

227
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:16.710 
Currently, we focus on active, strategic and adaptive learner.

228
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:22.490 
Since their research on regulation has progressed, we focus

229
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.410 
on metacognition, self-regulation, co-regulation and socially shared regulation

230
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.680 
and especially because of new technologies, we also implement

231
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.160 
various kind of new data channels to collect data.

232
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.450 
And this is called multi-modal data.

233
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:47.470 
And this kind of approach to study collaborative learning processes

234
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:53.820 
and in general learning and regulation has been very innovative for us,

235
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.920 
mainly because all this digital world provides

236
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.170 
various ways to capture learning process.

237
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.300 
And we call them different data channels which we are able

238
00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.810 
or actually modalities which we are able to combine and look

239
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.970 
at the learning process. For example, collect

240
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:20.480 
video data about how students work and interacting context,

241
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:26.440 
implement more by eye-tracking to look at the focus of attention in students' work,

242
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:32.340 
collect physiological data by the multi sensors for example

243
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:38.940 
EDA or heart rate and always implement various technologies

244
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.530 
to collect log data, situated questionnaires and so on.

245
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.640 
For example this is a

246
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:53.950 
situation in our past year data collection which we have currently

247
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.680 
in our hands, in analysis we have been working with

248
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.530 
collaborative science inquiries in physics with secondary school

249
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.980 
students and collected with different data channels,

250
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.250 
data while students have been working and collaborating, for example

251
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.620 
physiological activation or video data and so on.

252
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.840 
All these kind of data collection blasts all this digitalisation gives us

253
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.070 
something what is currently in our hands.

254
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.110 
So this is data in digital learning and education

255
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:40.150 
currently the ways we use artificial intelligence

256
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:45.260 
in education and use data is from my perspective rather narrow.

257
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.610 
And we should push the field to consider

258
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.880 
how we can use all these opportunities with the data

259
00:20:55.290 --> 00:21:00.680 
in a more deeper way to really help students, for example,

260
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.820 
are we able to create such kind of artificial intelligence

261
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.980 
agents who are able to collaborate with the learners and help

262
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:15.870 
learners feel and for example in their metacognitive activities and processes.

263
00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.780 
And also a serious question to be studied and discussed is that

264
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:28.070 
who or what does originality modelling, is it the learner or a system.

265
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.580 
But these are the questions under discussion and investigation

266
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.120 
because a fact still is even in this digital world that learning

267
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.650 
is always contextualised in the lived experiences we have in those

268
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.060 
situations where we interact with the other people and all this

269
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.500 
this in context whether they are in school or somewhere else.

270
00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:01.020 
So, my perspective as a learning scientist is that all these future opportunities

271
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:07.350 
in AI and with adaptive systems they provide, they are excellent

272
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.980 
for helping learners to be aware about their learning processes,

273
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:16.390 
but what we want is that learners themselves learn to be adaptive.

274
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.660 
So therefore we are working in order to develop this theory of

275
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.070 
socially shared regulation and perhaps also metrics to measure that and

276
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.860 
help learners to be more adaptive.

277
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.840 
Also all this data and analytics we have available at the moment.

278
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:45.010 
it is very helpful in many sense but what is important is that this is using

279
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.500 
that all these availabilities

280
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:55.810 
will be used for helping people to be meta cognitively aware, so that

281
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.720 
these digital affordances would help to put smart

282
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.870 
working in the center and give for example visual feedback

283
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.870 
and support for learners.

284
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:15.790 
Also what we are doing is that we are currently

285
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:21.310 
working for finding digital solutions for active learning.

286
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:27.030 
This is concerning all these socio-technical environments including

287
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.720 
spaces, whether they are

288
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.790 
in distance are face to face or hybrid. But that the

289
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.520 
core thing is that we steer digitality to kindle learning

290
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.340 
not really to pass it in the forms of digital

291
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.390 
environments or digital or learning material so that all the

292
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.730 
activities students do they would facilitate they activate learning

293
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:56.970 
asking questions arguing and making inquiries with complex phenomena.

294
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.970 
Finally I would like to end an and close my talk with a bigger picture.

295
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:10.410 
This is something we currently work in a older university. We have a

296
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.890 
big profiling project GenZ

297
00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:22.650 
which is focusing on studying co-evolution of human capabilities and intelligent technologies.

298
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.380 
We are working hard in a multi-disciplinary way

299
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:32.440 
with different disciplines to strengthen human capabilities,

300
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:41.460 
mainly because our argument is that some years ago we were approached

301
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:47.720 
after some educational technology or intelligent technologies were already developed,

302
00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.330 
and we were asked to use or observe how learners use them.

303
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.720 
But this is not possible anymore.

304
00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.290 
We have to participate as human scientists to this co-evolution

305
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.180 
of human capabilities and intelligent technologies and bring

306
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.060 
all this knowledge, how we understand how people learn,

307
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.790 
interact and all these

308
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.450 
understanding and research knowledge we have about humans.

309
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.780 
And finally I would like to end my presentation with a short video.

310
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.570 
This is from Oulu but

311
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.190 
unfortunately our

312
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.670 
life is not, or fortunately our life is we have four seasons

313
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.750 
in Oulu and this is a picture

314
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:43.450 
some times ago. Now we have a wonderful summer in Oulu but

315
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.860 
this picture is Oulu in the winter skin and also

316
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.640 
I described the idea how do we work in this GenZ.

317
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.660 


318
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:07.160 


319
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.180 
And finally I would like to thank you for listening.

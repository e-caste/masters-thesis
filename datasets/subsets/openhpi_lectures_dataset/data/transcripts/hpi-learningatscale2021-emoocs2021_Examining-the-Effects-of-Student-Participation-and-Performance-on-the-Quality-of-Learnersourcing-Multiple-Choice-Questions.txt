00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.410 
for everyone my name is steven moore

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.720 
and i'm here to talk about

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.930 
our work on examining. the effects of student participation

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.720 
and performance on the quality of learnersourcing multiple
choice questions.

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.410 
so as you may know multiple choice questions also known as

6
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.230 
mc q's are the most popular form of assessment likely due to

7
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.630 
the efficiency of scoring.
the way you can create objectively

8
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.990 
and the great analysis you can perform on them additionally.

9
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.150 
mc q's generally assess recall such as asking you to define a word,

10
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.410 
or picking which historical figure participated in a certain activity.

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.820 
but they can also be designed to test application,

12
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.880 
or you actually have to do some computations and apply knowledge

13
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.850 
in a different way previous work has leveraged learnersourcing

14
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.210 
to construct mc q's. but in a less natural context so to formally

15
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
define it learner sourcing is a form of crowdsourcing in which

16
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.670 
students contribute novel content for future learners while

17
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.660 
engaging in a meaningful learning experience themselves

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.190 
systems. you may be familiar with such as peerwise quizzical

19
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.070 
and ripple have utilized learnersourcing by having students actually generate mcqs.

20
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.290 
however these are kind of less natural context as they're external

21
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.450 
systems they require students to go from wherever. they're working

22
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.030 
such as canvas or some other instruction system into the system

23
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.080 
to make multi-choice questions.
and then back into the instructional system.

24
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.850 
so there's a little bit of a context shift there.

25
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.590 
so what we want to do is to naturally engage students in the

26
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.210 
mcq generation process as prior work has shown that there is

27
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.640 
a great benefit to student learning, when they generated mcq 's

28
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.850 
so through this we wanted to better understand, how students

29
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.840 
can participate and interact with generating mcq 's and ultimately.

30
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
we wanted to improve this process, so we can benefit student

31
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.340 
learning and also kind of increase the quality of the questions they may generate.

32
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.340 
so to do this we had two hundred one students enrolled in online chemistry course

33
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.160 
fifty seven of those two hundred one students chose to participate

34
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.980 
in our activity by generating a multi choice question. and this

35
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.960 
was presented to them in a completely low-stakes and optional

36
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.250 
manner. so you could just skip it you could go over they didn't

37
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.210 
have to do it we then had three experts using nineteen item

38
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.620 
rubric to review the quality of the questions students generated.

39
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.220 
we also had those same three experts evaluate the cognitive

40
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.180 
level of the question either recall or application.

41
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.090 
and here's a picture of the actual question to use again very

42
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.150 
brief instructions to input the question text appear in the

43
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.310 
four answer choices below very bare-bones.

44
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.890 
so we evaluated the quality of these mcqs using
a rubric developed by prior work.

45
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.530 
we used a nineteen item rubric that was a four item writing

46
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.960 
flaws that previous work is used and has criterias like hey

47
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.500 
make sure you use absolute terms never always make sure you

48
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.740 
don't repeat a word in the question text in the correct answer to christensen.

49
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.680 
and we also had experts actually use the nineteen rubric they

50
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.690 
assessed the current level the question saying.
it was recall or application based

51
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.240 
so to argue one we wanted to know how does participation in

52
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.190 
online course materials impact students' contribution to learnersourcing activities.

53
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.610 
we had about twenty eight percent of the students admitted

54
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.210 
mcq fifty seven of two hundred one

55
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.960 
having said thirty seven of the two hundred one did not interact

56
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.020 
with any activities.
so that's not a bad participation rate

57
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.760 
for a completely optional inescapable learnersourcing activity

58
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.040 
of the fourteen activities are present in the course on average

59
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.730 
nine point seven five were done students tended to have this

60
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.150 
behavior of not really doing any activities maybe just the

61
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.350 
first few or doing all the activities.
so usually on the extremes

62
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.230 
and our students often completed all of the steps present the

63
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
activities embedded throughout the course they were also more

64
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.370 
likely to do the mcq generation task, so again if you were a

65
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.040 
student that tended to do all the activities one of those activities

66
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.580 
ended up being the mcq generation task.

67
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.930 
so also toward participation we found students spent roughly

68
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.920 
eighteen and a half minutes working on the activities found

69
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.870 
through the course in total.

70
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.550 
and the students that did the mcq generation task spent about

71
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.430 
thirty two minutes on activities while students that did not

72
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.730 
do the test met about eighteen minutes. so there's about a fourteen

73
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.460 
minute difference between the student that did the task and

74
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.190 
those that did not however the actual task itself took on average

75
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.630 
about two and a half minutes. so the extra time students spent

76
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.260 
on activities wasn't just devoted to the mcq generation one

77
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.890 
suggesting. they may have spent more time on other activities

78
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.740 
or learning or just giving a little more effort.

79
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.050 
so far q two we wanted to know what is the quality of student-generated

80
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.460 
multiple choice questions from an optional and low-stakes learning environment

81
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.190 
and these are the results of the item-writing flaws rubric.

82
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.920 
we applied as you can see about two thirds of the student questions

83
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.810 
had either one or zero flaws meaning they were acceptable for use they could

84
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.320 
be inserted right back into the course as formative assessments.

85
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.030 
it is very rare to get three or four errors in a single question.

86
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.990 
these are the top five flaws we had for this in questions that

87
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.910 
make up about seventy percent of the identified flaws mcq is

88
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.620 
as you can see ambiguous or unclear information and implausible

89
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.910 
distractors were very popular

90
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.660 
also related to rq two we wanted to assess the cognitive level.

91
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.780 
the question as you can see an overwhelming majority were this recall

92
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.860 
although we did have eight of the fifty seven questions target application

93
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.070 
and interestingly the application level ones had either none

94
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.760 
or one area. we didn't have any one two three four suggesting

95
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.540 
that students maybe that made these application questions kind of a

96
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.960 
were a little better at constructing the mcq 's.

97
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.480 
so for final rq we wanted to know if certain student interactions

98
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
in an online course were associated with the quality
of multiple-choice questions they generate.

99
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.640 
we didn't find any correlations between the quality of the

100
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.230 
question and student participation on tasks again there could

101
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.440 
be a ceiling effect of students either doing barely any of

102
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.180 
the activities or doing all of the activities.

103
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.190 
and we didn't find a correlation between the time students

104
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.040 
spent on the activity and its quality so no real difference

105
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.150 
was conducted in a case where student eight minutes on this

106
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.360 
activity versus maybe one minute.

107
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.020 
however we did find a correlation on the quality of the student

108
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.490 
question and performance on other tasks, so if student made

109
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.780 
more incorrect responses at the course they tend to have a

110
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.130 
lower question quality and vice versa.

111
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.200 
and very relatedly we found a positive correlation between

112
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.120 
the first attempt correct students made on problems and the

113
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.850 
quality of the question, so if a student got a question right

114
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.950 
on the first try more likely than not that the mcq generation

115
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.010 
task had a higher quality.

116
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.540 
so participation rates were higher than expected
for an optional low-stakes learnersourcing activity

117
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.010 
about twenty percent of the students chose to participate in

118
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.790 
it which is pretty good for learnersourcing admittedly.

119
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.840 
the task was met naturally right we didn't use any other systems.

120
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.550 
we just took some free responses short answer boxes, so hopefully other

121
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.690 
tech systems could utilize it since we didn't have to use any

122
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.380 
other tool or make any linking like that.
it's kind of like a hacking together

123
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.730 
of the existing infrastructure and while
there was some association between participation

124
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.170 
on the task and other activities again the course only had

125
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.550 
fourteen kind of activities altogether.
so again maybe there's a ceiling effect，

126
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.010 
since we're able to generate mcqs that could readily be added

127
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.090 
to a course and used as a formative assessment.

128
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.070 
so majority the questions had zero one item-writing flaws which is pretty

129
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
high compared to other words. and those sixty-seven questions

130
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.530 
could readily be added back to the course with no edits

131
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.920 
an overwhelming majority these questions were the recall level.

132
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.420 
but that is to be expected as they are multi-choice questions

133
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.630 
and just the nature of the questions lends itself more to recall

134
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.750 
although you can target application with it.

135
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.510 
and we can wonder if we could provide explicit instructions

136
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.210 
or training to try to have students correct these common flaws

137
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.120 
made or to elevate the cognitive level,
in the future we love to automatically evaluate

138
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.930 
questions by applying the item-writing criteria to it.

139
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.950 
we love to engage students of all levels not just students do all the
activities.

140
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.310 
but maybe students skip the activities because already

141
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.870 
know it we would still love to grab them in. but again we don't

142
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.760 
want to necessarily force anyone to have to do this task.

143
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.380 
and finally we love to get students to dream cq the higher

144
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.150 
cognitive level of application not just recall.

145
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.390 
so conclusions don't participation and performance with activities

146
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.770 
did correlate with contribution on the mcq task. they were in general

147
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.990 
evaluated high quality against sixty seven percent of them

148
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.900 
were high quality having just one or no errors. and again this

149
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.180 
task was completely low-stakes and optional so pretty good

150
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.040 
turnout rate for that and we did have those recall or application levels

151
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.350 
and there were some soon behaviors in the course that correlate

152
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.280 
with both of those that's all.

153
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.950 
thanks for your time and see everyone learning at scale.

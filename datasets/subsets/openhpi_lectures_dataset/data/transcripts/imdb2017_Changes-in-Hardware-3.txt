1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300 
Ok, so now that we've
been talking about CPUs

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.700 
let's move on and talk about
the rest of the hardware.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.110 
So, this is a really
simplified system

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.140 
and if you take the time
you can probably find

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.160 
a lot of things that are
really wrong with that

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.190 
but it helps us to give
a little structure to

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.230 
the things that we're
discussing. In the middle

8
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.260 
we have the CPU, we've been
talking about that right

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.290 
now and then we have two
parts of components we

10
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.320 
have the orange components that
are the components that store

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.360 
data, we have storage like HDD
and SSD and we have main memory,

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.410 
and then we have the red parts
that process data in some ways

13
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.440 
we have the CPU, which of
course processes is pretty much

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.470 
everything, we have the network
interface and now we have all

15
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.500 
different types of accelerators
and what we want to do in

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.550 
the second part is go around
all these four parts and discuss

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
how these will or might
change in the next years.

18
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.620 
So the first question
that we want to ask is why

19
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.650 
do we actually have two
components that store our data?

20
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
So we have the main memory that
has all the data that we actually

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.750 
work with and then we have
storage like HDD and SSD

22
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.780 
that keeps the data that
we don't use at the moment.

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.820 
So that's the storage hierarchy
that we've been talking

24
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
about in the
morning, I chose a

25
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
different approach to
visualizing it here, so when

26
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.920 
you look into DRAM on the left
side and then HDD on the right,

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.940 
there are certain dimensions
in which you can compare those

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.990 
four, (correction) those two. You
have four dimensions, first one would

29
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.103 
be the latency, so how long does
it take to get a single piece

30
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.106 
of information and as you just
said the DRAM is really fast

31
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:49.109 
here so we have low
latency. We also have

32
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.112 
a high throughput, so we can get
a lot of data within a certain

33
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:56.116 
time frame. So these two
red things are dimensions

34
00:01:56.116 --> 00:02:00.120 
where DRAM is really good, now on
the other hand we have capacity

35
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.124 
and as you all know when
you bought your computer

36
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.127 
HDDs and SSDs still have
higher capacity than DRAM

37
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.131 
and the second advantage
of those is of course

38
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.134 
the price when you go into
hardware store your SSD will be

39
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:18.138 
much cheaper than DRAM. So
this is actually something that

40
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.141 
still keeps some people from
moving all of the data to

41
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.144 
DRAM, because they say
DRAM is so expensive,

42
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.148 
that's because of the
storage hierarchy.

43
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.153 
Ok, now as you saw before
I left a gap here and

44
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.155 
this what I want to talk
about in the next minutes.

45
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.158 
There's something
coming up called

46
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:42.162 
NVM, non volatile memory,
NVRAM, storage class memory

47
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:46.166 
or others that is
filling this gap so

48
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:51.171 
in pretty much every dimension
here it's coming between DRAM

49
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:56.176 
and SSD. So it's not as fast as
DRAM but it has higher capacity

50
00:02:56.176 --> 00:03:00.180 
than SSD's. So I'm going
to skip the numbers

51
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.183 
for the most part
just to show you

52
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:08.188 
there are no final
numbers in here yet but

53
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:12.192 
you can see the numbers
that are in the media

54
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.195 
already they range somewhere
in between DRAM and SSD.

55
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.197 
So you can see how that is
a really good gap filler.

56
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.201 
Now the thing that I've not been
talking about is the NV part

57
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.204 
of NVRAM, which stands
for non-volatile

58
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.207 
and that's actually one of the
biggest changes compared to

59
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.211 
DRAM because other than DRAM
and NVRAM doesn't need power to

60
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.214 
be refreshed all the time.
The problem with DRAM

61
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.217 
is because of the internal
structures that it uses,

62
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.220 
it loses energy over time so
when you store a one or zero

63
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.224 
at some point that one becomes
closer to zero because the energy

64
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:48.228 
level degrades and to avoid that
you have to refresh it, I think

65
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:52.232 
every 64 milliseconds, so you
have to pump in new energy.

66
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.236 
First, that costs you a lot
of energy that is not used for

67
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.239 
anything so one number that
I read once was that 30%

68
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.243 
of the energy usage
of your data center

69
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.245 
is just for the DRAM
refresh and that's

70
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.248 
something that's completely
wasted, so you are wasting 30%

71
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.251 
of your energy and then the
second problem is once you turn

72
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.254 
of the power and that's not
getting refreshed, everything is

73
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.256 
gone and you know that from
your own computer when you turn

74
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.257 
it off, that's all gone.

75
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.262 
Ok, so what we want to do
is when we get this new

76
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:26.266 
type of memory and we look into
databases, we want to understand

77
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.269 
how we can make use of that,
how that fits into our storage

78
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:33.273 
hierarchy and for that we've
been looking into the advantages

79
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.276 
and disadvantages of
NVRAM compared to DRAM.

80
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.279 
So, on the left side we
have all the advantages

81
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.283 
of DRAM, so as we heard
before DRAM is still faster

82
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:48.288 
than NVRAM and it has a
balanced read write latency.

83
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.292 
So, with everything
that you find about NVM

84
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:57.297 
for the upcoming products
online they always assumed

85
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.300 
that writing stuff is more
expensive than reading.

86
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.304 
So the advantage of DRAM here
is that it takes the same time,

87
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.308 
so writing is not
more expensive.

88
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:12.312 
With NVRAM, people expect that over
time it's going to become cheaper than

89
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:16.316 
DRAM because you can fit
more data into one DIMM

90
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:20.320 
and because they're still
opportunities in the manufacturing

91
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.324 
process, you don't
need any energy

92
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:30.330 
so you don't waste that
30 percent on refreshes,

93
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.334 
its persistent, and
you get more capacity.

94
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:39.339 
So when we look into four
classifications of data

95
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.342 
structures we can try to
decide if that's something

96
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:47.347 
that's good for DRAM or
NVRAM. We've seen how the

97
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:51.351 
types of data structures that we
use have an influence on whether

98
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:55.355 
they should go on DRAM or NVRAM. (Hasso
Plattner) I understand that computer

99
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.358 
scientists always want to
solve it from inside out

100
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.361 
so inside the database
they want to solve

101
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:08.368 
problems of types of acess,
access frequently, read

102
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:14.374 
sequentially needed for recovery.
I look at this from an application

103
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.074 
point of view

104
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:20.380 
and you easily can define,
from application point of view,

105
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.384 
which which data is accessed
frequently, which is

106
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:29.389 
written frequently, which is
not written at all or changed

107
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:35.395 
at all. So there is a clear
application definition between left

108
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:40.400 
and right, if we don't do aggregates
anymore, if we just recall

109
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.404 
transactional data and then
we know exactly how long

110
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:48.408 
transactional data can be
changed, as long it can be changed

111
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.412 
we keep it on the left side
as soon as it can't be changed

112
00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:56.416 
anymore, next sync point,
next reorganization time

113
00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:01.421 
we move it to the right side.
So in the long term hopefully we

114
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.423 
don't have to make that
choice anymore, depending

115
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:07.427 
on who you ask NVRAM
will, at some point,

116
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.429 
become as fast or
even faster than DRAM

117
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.433 
and people say that might
be because the technology

118
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:17.437 
is not exhausted yet. So when
you look into DRAM, scaling

119
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.440 
it down further and further
becomes increasingly difficult.

120
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.443 
There are people who start
to stack it, there are

121
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:27.447 
more ideas but with
NVM we're opening up a

122
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.450 
whole new set of possibilities
and we might actually end up

123
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.453 
somewhere over here where all the
advantages are on the NVRAM side

124
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.456 
or whatever new
technology comes around.

125
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.460 
Ok, so we talked
about main memory

126
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.464 
HDDs, SSDs, and NVRAM
that's coming in somewhere

127
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.467 
here so what we can do in this
picture is we replace everything

128
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.470 
with NVRAM in the perfect world.
Now we only have universal

129
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.475 
memory and we don't have
to keep those two copies

130
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.479 
of data anymore. Now let's
go over here to the right,

131
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.482 
so I'm sure pretty
many of you have heard

132
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.485 
that GPUs are not used
only for games anymore

133
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:09.489 
but for things like machine
learning, for things

134
00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.492 
like mining bitcoins, so actually
the price of GPUs has gone

135
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.495 
up because people are
mining bitcoins now

136
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.498 
and they're buying all the good
GPUs and there are still a lot of

137
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.500 
things they can do with it and
that's something that Chris

138
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.500 
will talk about.

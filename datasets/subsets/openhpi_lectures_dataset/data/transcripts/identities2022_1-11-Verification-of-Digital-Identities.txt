00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.090 
In our openHPI course about digital identities,
now we want to consider in more detail

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.810 
the verification of
digital identities.

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.800 
The verification, that means the
binding of a digital identity

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.790 
to a physical one.
Let's consider the

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.260 
situation when a new digital
identity is created.

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.150 
This is the case when a user registers
him- or herself to an online service.

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.870 
To this end, a number of
data have to be given

8
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.440 
name, address, telephone
number, bank number and these

9
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.850 
attributes, this data form
the digital identity.

10
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.360 
Now the service want or even need to know
whether this information is correct,

11
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.620 
whether it's really
belonging to a real person.

12
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.530 
But that's not enough.

13
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.980 
The service also need to know whether
these data really belong to the person

14
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.780 
that is just registering.

15
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.180 
So the question how the physical identity
is binded to the digital identity

16
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.290 
needs to be considered
and to be solved.

17
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.720 
Let's consider the case of an
online banking account

18
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.630 
and that a person wants to create
such an account and wants to apply

19
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.970 
for a credit card. Then the user and
his data, his name, address and so on

20
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.160 
on the bank's website and a
digital identity is created

21
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.570 
from these data. The bank now wants to
know whether the entered data

22
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.300 
really belong to the
specified person.

23
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.010 
And for this purpose it is
necessary to securely connect and

24
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.950 
confirm a digital identity
with a physical identity.

25
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.260 
The user must prove his identity
to bind his digital identity

26
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.090 
to his physical identity. This is
what we call the verification

27
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.520 
of a digital identity.

28
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.570 
And often this verification,
this binding of a digital

29
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.420 
identity to a personal identity is
part of the registration process.

30
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.430 
Such digital identities can
be linked in different ways

31
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.580 
to the physical
identity

32
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.710 
that actually exist. For example,
there are possibilities to

33
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.770 
do this with a Post-Ident
procedure or with a video

34
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.840 
identification.
VideoIdent is a

35
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.810 
popular service, which is
provided by a web ID, or the

36
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.550 
smart identity cards. So there
are different possibilities

37
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.140 
and mostly this is done this binding with
a cooperation, with an external service,

38
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.090 
with an external trustworthy provider
which is specialised in doing this.

39
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.270 
So for example with the post office
branch, with a trusted online service,

40
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.190 
with an electronic ID card
technology, or others.

41
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.270 
We want to consider, to
explain this in more detail,

42
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.780 
we want to consider
the two methods of

43
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.380 
providing such a binding by means of
web ID and smart identity cards.

44
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.800 
Let's start with web ID, the
video identification service

45
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.530 
and how it works. There are
several such services in place.

46
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.650 
Very popular is the
identification via web ID.

47
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.180 
The prerequisite what is needed to
use as the web ID service is

48
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.990 
one needs a computer with a camera, with a
microphone, with access to the internet.

49
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.560 
And then a valid identity
document is needed.

50
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:37.160 
An identity card or a passport. And
then third, a browser or web ID app

51
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.590 
is needed to be stored if for
example one doesn't use by means

52
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.540 
of a smartphone.

53
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:55.630 
Then how it works to identify
myself with a web ID? First,

54
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.700 
I have to enter the data into an
online service, for example the bank.

55
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.990 
Then the user will re-direct
it to the web idea website

56
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.250 
and here the user starts a video
chat. A video chat with

57
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.330 
an employee of
the web ID.

58
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.260 
And in this chat the user
must hold his ID card

59
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.630 
into the camera and
answer some questions.

60
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.540 
This is to prove, to find out is this
the real person, is the real person

61
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.330 
that belongs to that identity card
and at the end the web ID service

62
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.640 
confirms to the bank, yes or no, he is the
right person or not the right person.

63
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.380 
After the chat has ended, web
ID transmits the results

64
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.090 
to the online service and thereafter
the user is entitled to use

65
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.340 
the online service,
for example,

66
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.510 
to get access to
a bank account.

67
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.420 
So this is one way the video
chat with a real person

68
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.940 
which tries to find out

69
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.690 
whether there is a real

70
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.210 
correct binding between
this person and the data

71
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.570 
of that person.

72
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.820 
What are the advantages? Advantages are
that the identification is possible

73
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.960 
at any time, on day or night, every
time you get access,

74
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.150 
it's possible to
interact with web ID.

75
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.770 
Then the video chat only takes a few
minutes. So it is quite a simple way

76
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.410 
compared to the Post-Ident where
you have to go to the post office.

77
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.650 
Here it can be done from the
computer in a couple of minutes.

78
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.910 
And another advantage
is that it can

79
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.480 
that this can be done from home.
It's not necessary to go to

80
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.260 
a post office or to
another authority.

81
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.820 
What are the disadvantages? The
disadvantages is that trust is necessary

82
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.550 
in the web ID company and
in the web ID procedure.

83
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.910 
So the service that wants to identify,
it wants to verify a digital identity

84
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.960 
has to trust the
web ID company.

85
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.540 
And then the video chat
employee learns personal data,

86
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.250 
personal data of that person from the
ID card and which service is used.

87
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.170 
So although this can be considered a
disadvantage of that approach to

88
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.620 
identify a digital identity
by means of a web ID.

89
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.070 
For that reason I want to introduce a
second approach. The identification

90
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.870 
by means of a smart
identity card.

91
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.230 
In some countries, in many countries
meanwhile the identity card

92
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.920 
also provides an online functionality
and such identity cards

93
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.300 
which provide online functionalities
are typically called smart

94
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.520 
identity cards.

95
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:16.330 
To this end, the smart identity
cards include a digital identity.

96
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.310 
So the digital identity, beside the
physical, the digital identity

97
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.270 
can be used for accessing
online services.

98
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.210 
To give an example from
Germany, this is a German

99
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.510 
national German identity card and
this identity card is a smart one,

100
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.330 
there is

101
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.650 
also in a digital
identity stored on it.

102
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.730 
This card was introduced
in two thousand ten

103
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.870 
and can be used also for
online registration.

104
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:58.190 
And there is a number of supporting
online services but still

105
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.430 
very small, so that this approach
is up to now not so familiar.

106
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.190 
If we look to Estonia then we
see a more popular service.

107
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.880 
The e-Estonia is a movement
by the government of Estonia

108
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:24.660 
with the aim to facilitate the interaction
between state authorities and

109
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:32.030 
the citizens by means by use of
electronic online solutions.

110
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.620 
So there are various e-services
that can be accessed via such

111
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.930 
a smart ID card that's valid
in Estonia, so i-Voting,

112
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:50.290 
e-Tickets, e-Tax board, e-School. So it's
very impressive what's possible.

113
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:57.870 
And also here the access to the services
is based on the digital identity

114
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.840 
that stored on the
smart identity card.

115
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.600 
If one is using such a
smart identity card for

116
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:14.440 
authentication, then it is needed
that the card has such an

117
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:21.950 
e-ID functionality, that the card is
that the service is activated

118
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.210 
the on-line functionality. Then
a card reader is needed

119
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.790 
to make this accessible and
then of course the software,

120
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.600 
for example, the app

121
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.050 
that controls the

122
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.450 
use of the data out of
the smart identity card.

123
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.070 
The smart identity card

124
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.570 
and the usage of that is based on
a public key infrastructure.

125
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.500 
We discussed already the functionality
of such a public key infrastructure

126
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:03.570 
which provides for all the
participants the possibility to have

127
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.960 
these two keys and to certify

128
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.910 
the public key of each
of the participant of the PKI.

129
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.730 
If we look to the
German smart identity card,

130
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.570 
then a number of state authorities
serve to the PKI. You remember,

131
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.510 
PKI is a relatively complex
infrastructure, so the federal office

132
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.930 
of information security in
Germany, the BSI, this

133
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.870 
acts as the Root-CA
certification authority.

134
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.810 
The federal administration office
with the issuing authority

135
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.350 
for our authorisation
certificates, the VfB,

136
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.380 
this works as a registration
authority for the services.

137
00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:02.440 
And then we have an authorisation
certificate provider

138
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.260 
which issues the
technical certificates

139
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.660 
and here the D-Trust

140
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:19.540 
company works which is a hundred
percent daughter of the federal

141
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:27.190 
printing office and so, this
PKI is run and each user,

142
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.960 
of a smart
identity card

143
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.950 
in Germany, is participants

144
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.680 
of the PKI and
so that smart

145
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.990 
identity card contains
a certificate.

146
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.540 
Besides the user attributes
and the private key in

147
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:53.570 
identification, certificate is also
stored at the identity card.

148
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.990 
So a digital identity, these are the user
attributes that form the identity

149
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:04.290 
together with an certificate, a
certificate for identifying

150
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.170 
the user, for connecting
the public key

151
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.170 
is stored on the card.

152
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:18.100 
Then the identity card first checks
the authorization certificate

153
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.980 
of the online service for
a request. So it is checked

154
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.480 
whether the authorisation
certificate provider,

155
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.270 
whether the authorisation
certificate is valid

156
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.310 
and it checks the
validity of the Root

157
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.050 
certification authority.

158
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:42.500 
Then the authorisation certificate
also specifies the data

159
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.100 
required by the service and
displayed this to the user,

160
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:53.950 
only after the user's consent.

161
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.930 
And this consent is
given by entry pin,

162
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:05.010 
the required data will be transferred,
signed with the private key

163
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:12.040 
from the smart identity
card to the service provider.

164
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.050 
So the online service can
then verify the signature

165
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.530 
by means of the identification certificate.
In the identification certificate

166
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.150 
that's also stored on the
ID card, there is the

167
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.860 
public key of the user stored
and with that public key the

168
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.360 
signature can be decrypted
and can be checked.

169
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:43.470 
The advantages and disadvantages of the
smart identity cards are the following.

170
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:49.080 
Advantages - there is a high protection
of the digital identity data.

171
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:55.170 
It's a very secure, very complex
system. The combination of the

172
00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:00.370 
identity card, this is the ownership,
and the pin, this is the knowledge, is

173
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:07.370 
needed to use it. There is
a mutual identification

174
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.730 
by receiving the authorisation
certificate on and check whether

175
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.490 
the service is allowed to
read data from the badge

176
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.580 
at all and there is an
end-to-end transmission

177
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.740 
which is completely
encrypted.

178
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.980 
Another advantage is that such an
identity card everyone has at hand.

179
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.570 
It is needed for several application
and so it can be used also to

180
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:42.770 
to use an online
service in the digital world.

181
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:49.650 
The disadvantage is a card reader,
a special device is needed

182
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.020 
to use it and in
some countries,

183
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.300 
in some countries
only few services

184
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:03.890 
support the identity card. So that's
not so attractive for the users

185
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.920 
to use this way for a
daily application.

186
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.130 
So to summarize, this

187
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.340 
verification of digital
identities discussions -

188
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.480 
in different context, verification
of the binding of a digital

189
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.450 
identity with a physical identity
is necessary, particularly

190
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.950 
in such high security context
like online banking

191
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:38.660 
or others. There are different ways
to do this, to do this verification,

192
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:43.520 
to check the binding between a digital
identity and a physical identity.

193
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:49.300 
One is by video identification,
as a Video-Ident

194
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.070 
procedures, for example with a
web ID that is easily possible

195
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.890 
and another approach is using
a smart identity card.

196
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:07.990 
Here the users need a card reader and
the online service requires valid

197
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.070 
authorisation certificates. It
need to be registered in that

198
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.710 
PKI in that smart identity
card can be used.

199
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:23.050 
The user must authorize the
transmission of identity data

200
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:29.820 
with the pin. So he can control
what kind of data are transmitted

201
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.100 
and in this way
it's possible to

202
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.570 
jump from the physical world into
the digital world and acting

203
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.320 
in the digital world by means
of a digital identity

204
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.550 
and connect this identity to
the physical identity here in

205
00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.590 
our physical world.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.340 
In our openHPI course about "Blockchain: Revealing
the Myth", now we want to discuss

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.180 
how the efficiency of
blockchain system can be raised.

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.330 
This is will become a longer
discussion over several clips

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.410 
and the starting point for this
discussion is the scalability trilemma.

5
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.480 
More efficiency can only be got

6
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.180 
by less decentralisation or security.

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.300 
In an attempt to make blockchain
based system more efficient,

8
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.230 
that means to raise the performance, to
allow more people to use the system,

9
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.350 
either the decentralisation or the
security of the system gets lost.

10
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.980 
In this context, we often speak
about the so-called trilemma.

11
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.830 
The trilemma which says that we can
have only two out of three aspects.

12
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.450 
And speaking about efficiency
in our course, we mean one of

13
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.050 
the most important properties of
decentralised networks besides security,

14
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.270 
namely the scalability,

15
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.750 
the number of users.

16
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.780 
And this efficiency
is measured

17
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.290 
how the performance varies when the
system is resized and whether

18
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.770 
the system can grow without loss, if more
and more people are interested to do this

19
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.490 
and of course we have already
seen that as well the bitcoin

20
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.850 
system as the Ethereum
system and other

21
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.750 
blockchain systems become more
and more popular and more and

22
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.240 
more people want
to use it.

23
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.980 
The term scalability
trilemma came from Vitalik Buterin,

24
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.460 
founder of Ethereum, and it describes
very well what happens. It

25
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.790 
states the scalability trilemma
that one can have only two out of

26
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.190 
either decentralization,
completely peer-to-peer network

27
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.900 
about scalability efficiency or security.
So trade-offs are almost unavoidable.

28
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.260 
And of course all three are
desired, as all important

29
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.510 
characteristics of a system but only
two can be assured simultaneously.

30
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.440 
And the third aspect will see a
dramatic decrease when

31
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.830 
we look to this three angle, then
decentralization, scalability, security.

32
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.940 
Of course security, this is the basis
of the system so here we will not

33
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.720 
lower the security level.
So there are

34
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.490 
conflict, the high level for
security and decentralization

35
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.320 
and we miss efficiency
for bitcoin Ethereum system.

36
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.300 
And when we optimize for security
and scalability provide efficiency

37
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.600 
then we have to play with decentralization
and decrease decentralization

38
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.350 
and Hyperledger Fabric and
Ripple, they are example of that.

39
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.200 
Let's have a short look on the decentralization.
We will see that it's important

40
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.010 
trigger for different modifications of the
blockchain systems. The trilemma says

41
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.440 
that one possibility to increase
the scalability, the efficiency is

42
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.070 
to reduce
decentralization.

43
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.820 
That means the system
can be more scalable

44
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.390 
if there are some users that
have more rights than others.

45
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.220 
We have already seen an example
when we discussed in the last

46
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.350 
clip the proof
of authority.

47
00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.830 
Here there was a group of users
that got the right to form

48
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.720 
to form blocks that are the right to
control the change, other users cannot.

49
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.190 
Other users have
to trust them.

50
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.380 
So in thea block chain scene this is
called the degree of decentralisation.

51
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.560 
Or the degree of decentralisation
that can be different in

52
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.260 
different block
chain solutions.

53
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.220 
Here in our course, now we will not
start to discuss the advantages

54
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.720 
and disadvantages of
decentralisation because

55
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.070 
the original goal of the block
chain system was a complete

56
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.830 
decentralized peer-to-peer network. But
later on when we discuss application

57
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.620 
then we will
see a lot of

58
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.930 
alternative solutions

59
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.730 
that play with a degree of
decentralisation in order to increase

60
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.860 
scalability, in order to increase
the efficiency of the

61
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.530 
blockchain based system.

62
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.990 
In summary, any attempt to make
blockchain system more efficient,

63
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.120 
either the decentralisation or the
security of the system gets lost.

64
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.640 
Security in this context
cannot be discarded, this is a

65
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.670 
constitutional example. So
scalability can be treated with the

66
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.300 
decentralization. And decentralization
can be reduced to increase scalability.

67
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.390 
The full extent of
decentralization

68
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.140 
pure peer-to-peer network

69
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.010 
is not really
scalability. So

70
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.620 


71
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.400 
the possibility to make blockchain based
system more efficient is to play

72
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.240 
with the degree of
decentralisation.

1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.770 
So, does gender play a role for
funding? Can entrepreneurship

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.490 
researchers observe differences
when it comes to female and

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.630 
male entrepreneurs acquiring
financial support and funding?

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.600 
And if so, what are the possible reasons
behind these observed differences?

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.280 
Welcome to the session
"Funding Female Venturing".

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.540 
For this video, Valeska and I
will discuss a widely popular

7
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.860 
research stream on female entrepreneurship,
namely gender bias in funding.

8
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.190 
We want to share some insights
from this research area with you,

9
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
not only because of its popularity
but also because the gender

10
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.670 
bias in funding has widespread implications
for the gender gap in entrepreneurship.

11
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.610 
In two thousand and five,
entrepreneurship researchers Susan

12
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.830 
Marlow and Dean Patton stated in their
study on female entrepreneurs' funding

13
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.230 
that "women entrepreneurs experience
barriers related to their

14
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.810 
gender when
seeking finance".

15
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.950 
Barriers can, for example, include
structural constraints which

16
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.190 
include not having access to
the relevant funding networks.

17
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.290 
Many years later, and this
quote still holds true today.

18
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.710 
Besides the topic's currency, it
is relevant for us to take a

19
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.690 
closer look at this topic because
when female entrepreneurs receive

20
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
no or little funding, their
business ideas may never come to

21
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.640 
life or their ventures present weaker
performance and success rates.

22
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.790 
This outcome then leads to an increased
under-representation of female-led ventures

23
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.020 
and widens the gender gap
in entrepreneurship.

24
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.660 
So what have researchers found out
about the potential challenges

25
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.320 
when it comes to funding
of female ventures?

26
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.990 
Entrepreneurship scholars differentiate
between two research streams

27
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.040 
when trying to explain the
gender bias in female funding:

28
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.550 
Entrepreneurship-driven research
and investor-driven research.

29
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.140 
The entrepreneurship-driven research
focuses mainly on the entrepreneur

30
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.350 
and the objective when asking
for external funding.

31
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.240 
Research has found that female entrepreneurs
tend to ask for less funding

32
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.350 
because, usually, they plan less
capital-intensive businesses

33
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.880 
and are less motivated
by high-growth goals.

34
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.550 
This observation aligns with other
studies on female entrepreneurship.

35
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.040 
Research has shown that female
entrepreneurs tend to focus

36
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.080 
less on expansion goals and economic gains
and rather on building a social enterprise.

37
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.390 
Often, they aim to fulfill social
goals that are relevant for

38
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.090 
society with their
businesses.

39
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.670 
In that sense, women are more likely to
start "hybrid"-businesses, which combine

40
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.540 
economic goals with complementary
non-economic goals such as social goals,

41
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.410 
self-fulfilment or
product quality.

42
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.290 
Due to the different objectives,
these types of ventures should

43
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.170 
be measured differently
than high-growth ventures.

44
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.740 
Entrepreneurship researchers suggest the
inclusion of non-economic indicators

45
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.170 
and social outcomes to better analyze
female-led businesses and their performances.

46
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.680 
The second research stream,
investor driven research,

47
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.550 
looks at how investors' biases can
pose barriers to receiving funding.

48
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.820 
Meaning, how investors base their decisions
on the entrepreneurs characteristics,

49
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.270 
for example, their speech patterns,
attractiveness and gender.

50
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.130 
Research shows that investors tend
to rely on stereotypical beliefs

51
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.670 
about how an entrepreneur should
look like and developed biases

52
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.120 
towards female entrepreneurs
and their competencies in the

53
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.990 
evaluation and
decision process.

54
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.300 
In a study from 2018,
Dana Kanze and her

55
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.190 
colleagues analyzed investor related questions
posed to female and male entrepreneurs.

56
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.390 
Their study shows that venture
capitalists asked different questions

57
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.760 
depending on the
entrepreneur's gender.

58
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.910 
Male entrepreneurs were mostly asked
so called promotion questions

59
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.590 
which focus on the
potential for gains.

60
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.700 
Such questions aim to promote the
business idea by asking, for example,

61
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.610 
how the entrepreneur will use the investors'
money to grow their business further.

62
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.470 
Whereas female entrepreneurs mostly got
asked so-called prevention questions.

63
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.490 
Prevention questions focus on the
potential for losses by asking

64
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.700 
how the entrepreneur plans on not
losing the investor's money.

65
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.560 
These types of questions lead to
female entrepreneurs having

66
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.330 
to defend their business idea more
than their male counterparts.

67
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.560 
Kanze and her colleagues further
found that those female founders

68
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.980 
who received
prevention questions,

69
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.660 
for the most part, ended
up with less funding.

70
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.140 
Quite interesting is also that their
research shows that this behavior

71
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.180 
applies both to male and
female venture capitalists.

72
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.500 
If you are curious about this article,
we will link the references below

73
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.500 
as well as a TED talk by Dana
Kanze introducing her research.

74
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.190 
Both, the entrepreneur driven and the
investor driven research streams show

75
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.280 
how female entrepreneurs raise
significantly lower external funding.

76
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.060 
According to the current Female Founders
Monitor, more than five percent

77
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.600 
of the surveyed female adventurers
in Germany received more

78
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.450 
than one million Euros
in external funding

79
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.780 
whereas more than twenty seven
percent of the male-led ventures

80
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.580 
received such an amount.

81
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.150 
Jorge Guzman and Aleksandra
Kasperschick show in a study

82
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.510 
of startups in the US that
female led ventures

83
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.230 
were sixty three percent less likely
to receive external funding

84
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.410 
than male led ventures.

85
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.370 
Research on female entrepreneurship
has shown that this funding gap

86
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.970 
has led to female entrepreneurs being more
dependent on the informal networks,

87
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.690 
such as friends
and families,

88
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.520 
as an alternative to receive
the necessary funding.

89
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.310 
To address this gap in funding,
entrepreneurship researchers

90
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.410 
have called for policies to intervene
and enable a more supportive

91
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.370 
environment for female entrepreneurs
in the funding phase.

92
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.970 
Policy interventions could, for
example, aim at venture capitalists

93
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.840 
or bank loan officers and offer educational
training to prevent potential gender biases.

94
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.280 
Others have suggested to develop more programs
in order to increase the financial literacy

95
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.240 
of female entrepreneurs and to
provide the necessary access

96
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.090 
to relevant sources
of capital.

97
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.770 
Generally, it is important to contextualize
this important issue in perspective.

98
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.710 
A study by Foss et al.
from 2018 reveals that

99
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.780 
the majority of publications in female
entrepreneurship include policy implications.

100
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.080 
However, the authors criticized
that they are oftentimes too

101
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.670 
broad and do not focus on
tackling structural conditions.

102
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.110 
The rising importance of
digitalisation in entrepreneurship

103
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.350 
has provided the opportunity to support
female entrepreneurs further.

104
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.450 
Initiatives such as the online
start-up accelerator "Grow F"

105
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.980 
aim to support female- led ventures by
providing them an educational program,

106
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.640 
access to funding networks,
and expert feedback.

107
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.690 
Such an online program shows
how digitalisation can function

108
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.770 
as a facilitator for
female entrepreneurs.

109
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.570 
Researchers call on policymakers to
use digital tools and technologies

110
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.300 
to adopt even more approaches to
stimulate female entrepreneurship.

111
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.310 
We hope that these research insights
on female ventures' funding

112
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.860 
gave you an idea of how entrepreneurship
researchers are currently

113
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.270 
studying this
research area.

114
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.770 
We look forward to seeing
you in the next video. Bye!

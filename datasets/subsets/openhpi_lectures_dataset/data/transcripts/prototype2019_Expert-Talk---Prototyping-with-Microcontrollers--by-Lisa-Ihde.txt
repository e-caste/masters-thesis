Hi! In this video we
want to learn about

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.630 
prototyping with microcontrollers
and this is why Lisa Ihde is here.

3
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.700 
Lisa is a computer engineer and
an expert on microcontrollers.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.290 
And can you maybe shortly explain
what a microcontroller is?

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.840 
Yes. A microcontroller
is a tiny chip with

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.340 
a specific task. So you
have a RAM and a CPU

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.990 
and it is really cheap. You can
find a microcontroller in

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.920 
different devices like a
toothbrush, coffee machine

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.110 
or a pacemaker. And here
you can see this tiny

10
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.120 
microcontroller board. - Okay, and how
can you prototype with something

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.820 
like this? - To prototype with it,
you combine it with components

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.980 
like a sensor, or a motor, or an LED,
and you can for example measure

13
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.280 
the temperature, and then
turn the light on.

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.390 
Okay, and can you show us an
example of a prototype like this?

15
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.680 
Yes of course. So this is an
example from the Advanced Track,

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.050 
and there we had the Power Cut
Challenge. And there we identified

17
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
a power cut, and then turned the
light on, on this smart module,

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.740 
and inside there is a microcontroller,
and then when it identifies a

19
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.340 
power cut, it sends an
email to the head office

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.550 
so that they know 'Oh okay!
There is a power cut!',

21
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.900 
and find out why there is a power cut.
- Okay, cool, so you actually used

22
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.150 
this as a prototype in a design
thinking process. Nice. - Yeah.

23
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.430 
And you also did an online course,
a MOOC, on programming these

24
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
microcontrollers. Can you share
some examples of what students

25
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.440 
did in the course? - Yes. So here
we have three examples: the piano

26
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.190 
made of fruits, the thermometer, and
a car with remote control, and

27
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.640 
it looks really sweet. And
here is the reality.

28
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.380 
So the piano made of fruit is
the first, and there you can

29
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.920 
see that each tone is an apple,
and so you can play simple

30
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
melodies with it. And the second
is the thermometer, so you have

31
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.520 
on this curve the different values
and can measure the temperature.

32
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.650 
And the last is a car with a remote
control, and there you can see the

33
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.490 
packaging is made of apple
juice, of the packaging

34
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.440 
of apple juice, and you can
then drive with the car.

35
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.360 
Great. So this course is still available
in archive mode, right? - Yes.

36
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.440 
If people want to
visit it, they can

37
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.860 
still look at the videos
and learn a bit about it.

38
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.810 
Yeah. And we also add the slides
and the subtitles in English

39
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.040 
so you can really enjoy our course.
- Cool. So if you're interested

40
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.590 
to learn a bit more about
programming microcontrollers, and

41
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.020 
now you know how you can use it
for prototyping, then go to

42
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.120 
the course. Thank
you so much, Lisa!

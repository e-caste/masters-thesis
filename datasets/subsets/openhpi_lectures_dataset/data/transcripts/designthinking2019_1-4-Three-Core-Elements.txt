00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.740 
Let's now move back to our
graphics, to the metaphor

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.090 
showing the Brockhaus, the
network environment, the mode

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.770 
and the IQ and the WeQ mode, and
let's think of how to get

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.800 
from Brockhaus to Network,
and how to move on the

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.160 
Grey arrow. When I
returned from Stanford

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.350 
12 years ago, I was trying to
note down what I have realised

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
there. I always basically new
answers to 3 core questions,

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.750 
and the First question was, How do
we work together in the future?

9
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.500 
and the Second was where we were
together? and the third was

10
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.080 
which kind of processes will be
used in the future? and That

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.590 
lead me to the three core elements,
which we want to focus on

12
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.630 
through the next 3 upcoming weeks.
Looking at those 3 core elements,

13
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.720 
We're first moving towards how
we work together. We moved

14
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.540 
away from focusing on the
individual creative power, we are

15
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.490 
focusing very much on the
creative power of teams.

16
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.540 
Not a large team, small team,
4-6; and we are appreciating

17
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.520 
every kind of diversity, like Gender
diversity, Different backgrounds,

18
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.680 
Different cultural backgrounds,
also and we are focusing on

19
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.150 
something which we call, "The team
of teams mode". So the second

20
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.760 
element is focusing on the space,
and if you look at the learning

21
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.140 
and working environments we are in
right now, most of them are designed

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
for an analog world, for the Brockhaus
world. They don't really work

23
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.200 
in the digital age and so we had
to redesign nearly everything,

24
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.130 
we had to redesign the tables, came
up with highly flexible furniture,

25
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.100 
everything on wheels, new
whiteboards, new environments,

26
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.420 
and make it as flexible as
possible, because teams need

27
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.480 
an environment which
is able to breathe.

28
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.100 
And the 3rd element is, the
process, is actually the method,

29
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.520 
how we do things in the future. And
the important part here is not

30
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.340 
the six steps which you see
here: the understand, observe,

31
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.560 
building a point of view, the
ideation, prototyping, and testing.

32
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.940 
Yes that is important but more
important is actually the little

33
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.670 
lines indicating that we do
this over and over again.

34
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.530 
But if you look at the 3 core
elements of Design Thinking

35
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.650 
as a whole, you'll figure out there's
nothing really new, there's

36
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.390 
nothing digital involved as well.
But if you really, intensively,

37
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.130 
redesign your way of working, your
place to work, and also your

38
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.300 
processes to work, in a way we're
describing that here. You're

39
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.820 
fundamentally doing
something different,

40
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.780 
to the culture of learning in a
learning environment and to

41
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.970 
the culture of working in
a working environment.

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.990 
In our openHPI course
Cyberthreats by Malware,

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.490 
now we want to introduce
Rootkits and Backdoors.

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.370 
Imagine your system has
what is called a backdoor.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.750 
Such a backdoor makes
it possible that an attacker

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.590 
can gain access to your computer,
can work on your computer,

6
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.190 
can see the data, can start
programs, can do anything.

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.730 
The problem is a backdoor means
that the owner of the system

8
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
is not aware that there is someone
else who can also work on

9
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.830 
his computer and can see all
things that are happening.

10
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.990 
So, if an attacker with administrator
rights could use a backdoor

11
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.900 
to remotely control your computer,
then he could do anything.

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.010 
He could install malware,
he could steal

13
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.320 
data, he could

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.140 
deactivate systems - for example install
malware, the antivirus software,

15
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.540 
the attacker
could record

16
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.570 
tap keystrokes
and others.

17
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
So backdoors are really a very
dangerous thing in particular

18
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.310 
when people are
not aware

19
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.280 
that there is a backdoor in their
computer and if the cyber attacker

20
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.920 
can use this backdoor with administrator
rights, with the highest

21
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.150 
rights, with the highest authority to
do things, then he can completely

22
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.270 


23
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.270 
reorganize the system and do all
things that can be done as such.

24
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.340 
The problem with such backdoors
is that the anti-virus programs

25
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.210 
they cannot detect
such a backdoor.

26
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.500 
So with the backdoor
the name says this that the

27
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.530 
attacker can access into your system
and can, like you, do all things

28
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.810 
you can do if you have no administrators
and he has administrator rights

29
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.910 
then he can do even
more than you.

30
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.890 
Rootkit - what
is a rootkit?

31
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.060 
The word is a composit of 'root' -
and this is typically designed

32
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.940 
for the administrator rights and
'kit' - this is a software component

33
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.390 


34
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.030 
to develop any tool. So such
rootkits is software

35
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920 
that could grant
administrator access

36
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.460 
for a victim system, for an attacker
or for an unauthorised use.

37
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.290 
What is required?
Required is

38
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.520 
that on the target system a
rootkit is installed to work.

39
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.280 
By means of such a rootkit
software, the taker can

40
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.580 
get access
to the system.

41
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.040 
Of course such rootkits are designed
in a way that they are hidden

42
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.470 
and that they are not detectable by the
system components, by the system owner.

43
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.530 
They contain tools that allow
cybercriminals to perform actions

44
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.520 
as administrator, to disable
security components, to install

45
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.440 
backdoors to
the system or others.

46
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.010 
So this is a
key component and

47
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.910 
to do such things on a computer
if the attacker is possible to

48
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.040 
place such a
rootkit on your

49
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.390 
computer and can do this.

50
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.900 
Speaking about backdoors, we
already did this. This described

51
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.000 
a method for secretly
gaining access to a system,

52
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
to bypass security measures. This
is important and dangerous in

53
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.270 
the systems. So the anti-virus
scanners or the firewall

54
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.700 
systems - they are not able
to detect this and the

55
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.200 
user of such a backdoor, the cyber
attacker can gain a higher privilege,

56
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.510 
for example root
privilege.

57
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.380 
By means of such a rootkit and if
such a backdoor in the beginning

58
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.790 
only it's allowing to the attacker
to get access to the system.

59
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.880 
By means of the rootkit, the
attacker also can gain root privilege,

60
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.890 
the highest privilege to
interact with the system.

61
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.190 
Backdoors can be created through
different methods, for example

62
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.370 
by exploiting program errors, bugs
or vulnerabilities in the system,

63
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.260 
the attacker checks what kind of
systems are running, checks what

64
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.210 
is known about the vulnerabilties and
then can exploit them to misuse this

65
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.200 
vulnerabilities to create a
backdoor, for example.

66
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.190 
It can also be done
intentionally,

67
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:36.390 
to install a backdoor for
example to maintain to help troubleshooting

68
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.010 
by the administrators
to the system, to the

69
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.650 
system users. Such backdoors can be
installed by malware, for example

70
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.090 
such as Trojan
or worm.

71
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.760 
To have a better understanding
for such rootkit and backdoor,

72
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.930 
here is an example - the Sony
Rootkit from 2005.

73
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.520 
Sony Extended Copy
Protection Rootkit -

74
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.680 
this was a software tool that
was developed by Sony and the

75
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.640 
idea was to prevent audio
CDs from being copied.

76
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.480 
It was in the beginning where with
this new digital technology all

77
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.610 
music and movies are distributed
over the internet and the

78
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:38.430 
seller Sony wanted to make sure that
if some people have bought the CD,

79
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.850 
then it's not possible
to copy the

80
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.130 
movies or the songs on a computer and then
later on distributed over the internet.

81
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.490 
And the idea of the functionality
of said Sony rootkit was

82
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.610 
when inserting
an audio CD,

83
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.530 
the consumer had to agree to a
license - this was shown to him.

84
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.830 
But in the background secretly,
it also installed a rootkit.

85
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.020 
And the idea and the functionality
of this rootkit was

86
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.230 
to prevent that any
copy software

87
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.950 
from a black list of
copy programs can get

88
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.470 
access to the

89
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.250 
compact disc drive. So
the rootkit was able

90
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.030 
to check when a program

91
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.250 
wants to get access
to the CD drive,

92
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.520 
whether it is a copy program and
then the rootkit prevents that

93
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.090 
the program can get
access to the drive.

94
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.900 
This Rootkit also hides all
files that contains

95
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.130 
this 'sys' string

96
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:15.070 
which contain the string in
their name from anti-virus software

97
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.240 
and malware scanner because they
like to prevent that this software

98
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.550 
was detected by the anti-virus
malware by the scanners.

99
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:33.440 
A big problem was also the scanners
where it hides all the real malware

100
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.160 
before being
detected by the

101
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.030 
anti-virus scanners
software.

102
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.680 
So, there were some programming
errors in this rootkit and this

103
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:52.650 
led to a system crash and
led to data loss and

104
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:59.140 
in this way people become
aware of this. It was not an

105
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:05.620 
attack by a cyber criminal, it was
using the methods of cyber criminals

106
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:12.570 
by a company to do something what is
acceptable, to prevent copying,

107
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.430 
but in this way and in
particular because it was

108
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.660 
done not in a correct way
due to the programming errors,

109
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.740 
a huge number
of computers

110
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:32.980 
twenty two million were infected
including all the military systems

111
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.680 
because all people that
want to see or want to

112
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.910 
run such an audio
CD on their computer,

113
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.460 
they got infected because they
have to agree to the licenses,

114
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.860 
this was a visible part and

115
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.700 
secretly behind there was a rootkit
installed to prevent this copying.

116
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.190 
What are protective measures
against rootkits and backdoors?

117
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.510 
Use your computer only with an account
that does not have administrator rights.

118
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.510 
Even if it's your own laptop and even
if you have administrator rights

119
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.620 
on that laptop, for the daily work you
should establish another account

120
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.270 
without such
administrator rights,

121
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.080 
because then some things are not
possible from that account.

122
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.070 
So it is much more difficult
for the attacker to

123
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.750 
get the administrator
rights, if he

124
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.310 
can only access accounts
that do not have

125
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.210 
administrator rights.

126
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.460 
Another protective
measure is -

127
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.580 
this is a very general

128
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:55.770 
protective measure - is that you should
carefully check and install genuine software.

129
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:03.980 
Look what kind of software, look what kind
of apps you install on your smartphone.

130
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:11.870 
Take it from secret sources - sources
like the official app stores,

131
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:20.890 
of the android or the apple
systems because they care for

132
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.180 
security checks, there are many other app
stores and there it's not clear

133
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.670 
whether the software you can take
from there is carefully checked.

134
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:38.260 
Then regularly you should install security

135
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.190 
and software updates.

136
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:47.550 
In several places we already discussed that
software updates are typically designed

137
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.220 
when the vulnerability is
detected in that software.

138
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:58.970 
Then the vendor tries to repair it, so
that this vulnerability cannot be exploited,

139
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.170 
cannot be misused
by the attacker.

140
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.410 
And then always is this is important
particularly with the

141
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:12.890 
internet of things, smart devices
you should change all default passwords.

142
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:20.380 
Also in laptops and other things, you have such
a default user name password combination,

143
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.590 
this is at
the start

144
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.340 
to work with the system.
Then one has to configure it

145
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.830 
and definitely
one has to

146
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.490 
close all the
default accounts.

147
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.430 
About more protective measure we will
discuss at the end of the week

148
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.600 
when we have considered more
types of malware.

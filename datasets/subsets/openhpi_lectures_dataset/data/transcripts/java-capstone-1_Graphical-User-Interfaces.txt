00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.920 
(inaudible)
No, actually it's graphical
user interfaces and

2
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.170 
we will have a look at
a couple of libraries

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.760 
that we can use to create those.
That already sounds like a history lesson!

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.920 
It is. So we'll start
in the middle ages

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.230 
with the Abstract Window
Toolkit (AWT),

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.330 
which is outdated. It was
replaced by swing somewhere

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.820 
in the renaissance or so.

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.540 
But some of these basic libraries
are still existent

9
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.970 
and used with Swing,
so it's kind of..

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.060 
If you think about your brain
or one of these things that

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.680 
kind of steer, eating and drinking
and so on.
One of your weird metaphors

12
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.020 
again. Yeah, let's just
commence. The somewhat newer

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.210 
GUI libary Swing:
so, it more or less mostly

14
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.140 
replaced AWT and in Swing
everything you see, so everybody

15
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.400 
button you see every text field
you're seeing there

16
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.900 
is basically drawn by Java.
Java is running around and

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.640 
drawing every
pixel in there and

18
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.250 
this also allows that it might
be seemed, so you can have,

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.520 
like, a mac-seemed Java
program on a Windows computer

20
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.780 
or you can apply the
so-called steel seem.

21
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.850 
It looks strange
on every platform.

22
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.990 
So, that was the default
seem for Java programs.

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.560 
Basically, it doesn't look strange,
it looks like a Java program.

24
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.360 
Yeah, so that it looked like a
Java program program. But Swing is not

25
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.240 
used any longer or to
such extent any longer.

26
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.040 
Right? I mean, it's still
pretty common but there's

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.150 
a new kit in town and that's
JavaFX and

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.810 
in contrary to Swing and in
AWT where you really

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.730 
program the GUIs with
the Java code you have

30
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.230 
the possibility here to write
an XML dialect, FXML,

31
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.310 
so if you have a background
for example it's

32
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.890 
way easier to
switch to the

33
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.390 
XML language and write
the GUIs there; and also

34
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.490 
it's easier for non-programmers,
so, designers, people

35
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.860 
that know how programs
should look like,

36
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.840 
to write these things and
then pass it on to the

37
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.680 
programmers and let them
do the kind of

38
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.320 
function. Ok, and you said also
it's better with graphs and diagrams

39
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.390 
and can be combined with
Swing so I thought:

40
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.190 
why don't.. do we use it? Why don't
we use it? I haven't seen it on your

41
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.730 
computer! We won't use it; maybe
I'll show you a (inaudible)

42
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.070 
quick example in
one of the upcoming videos

43
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.340 
but we will, or we plan
to do an extra workshop

44
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.210 
on JavaFX as one of
the follow-ups here.

45
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.150 
For now, as we said we want
to do a game and there's

46
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.540 
kind of a really cool tool for
getting into it and really

47
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.220 
easily getting started
and that's Processing.

48
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.460 
Processing is, as I said, easy
to use, easy to get started

49
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.780 
and it really is cool at doing
animations and user interactions.

50
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.090 
Okay, if it's so easy and if it's easy
to get started, let's get started!

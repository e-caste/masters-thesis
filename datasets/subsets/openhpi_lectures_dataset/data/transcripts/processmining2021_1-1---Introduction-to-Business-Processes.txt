00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.680 
Welcome to this video clip in which
we will introduce business processes.

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.090 
So, business processes are everywhere.
So as clients, we trigger

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.360 
business processes, for instance if we
apply for a permit to build a house

4
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.050 
or if we apply for a credit to
finance property and we also

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.270 
trigger the execution of a business process
when we submit an insurance claim.

6
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.010 
In our professional lives, we
participate in business processes

7
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.650 
and often we are even responsible for
these business processes. For instance,

8
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.460 
we check if the requirements for
building a house are actually met.

9
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.850 
We need to assess the risk of granting
a certain credit application

10
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.970 
and we also check whether a claim is
covered by the insurance contract.

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.840 
So, we are very much interested
in the process and we can use

12
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.230 
models to describe it.

13
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.660 
So, here you see a sketch drawing of a very
simple model of this claim processing

14
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.750 
process that I was talking
before in the last slide.

15
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.280 
So, here we have a
client and we have

16
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.330 
an insurance company and you'll see here
that the client sends a claim message

17
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.030 
to the insurance company and the
insurance company runs a business

18
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.530 
process. And many things happen to this
claim inside of the insurance company

19
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
pool that we see here.

20
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.880 
Ultimately and finally, a decision
is taken whether to grant the

21
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.460 
claim or whether to not grant the
claim and in these cases, either

22
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.370 
a letter of approval is sent or
a letter of rejection is sent.

23
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.050 
So, here we have a very
simple, very abstract model

24
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.380 
of a process in which mainly the two
players are represented and also

25
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.760 
the message communication
is shown here.

26
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.750 
We can go a little bit deeper. For
instance we can use BPMN

27
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
business process diagrams to also
represent the internal structure

28
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.970 
of the process and you see this
here on the lower left side.

29
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.370 
So, this is a BPMN
business process diagram

30
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.510 
in which you have the pool of the
insurance company, where the

31
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.280 
claim is received, you need to
register the claim, decide on

32
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.590 
claim coverage are the next activities
and then there is a branching. So, either

33
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.490 
you prepare a letter

34
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.330 
of approval and you send it or
you take the lower branch and

35
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.200 
you prepare a letter of rejection
and then you send the rejection.

36
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.090 
So here is a business process model
that tells us which activities

37
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.340 
have to be executed and in
which order these activities

38
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.120 
have to be executed.

39
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.820 
Now, if you want to know more about
BPMN, about BPMN process

40
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.370 
models and also
about the

41
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.710 
fundamental concepts behind it, including
petrinets, you are really invited

42
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.050 
to look at an earlier openHPI
online course that we did. So,

43
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.760 
if you search this URL,
if you search for bpm2019

44
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.970 
you get access to this course and you
still can watch the whole video

45
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.050 
clips that we have in
this MOOC as well.

46
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.270 
Alright. So, what is the role now
of these process models, or

47
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.030 
what is the meaning and why do
we use this process model? Well,

48
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.940 
traditionally process models serve as
blueprints for process executions.

49
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.120 
So, that's a very important usage
of process models and that's all

50
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.060 
very fine.

51
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.640 
The assumption being here, that the
process is executed as defined,

52
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.520 
that means the activities are
observed in the order defined

53
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.600 
in the process model.

54
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.380 
So, assume we have now this process
model represented here in the

55
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.430 
BPMN business process diagram.
We can use this as what we

56
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.340 
call a blueprint process model. Because it's
a blueprint for all process instances

57
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.710 
based on that model. So, we have here
the blueprint process model and that

58
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
has a very strong effect on the
process execution environment.

59
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.310 
The process execution environment
is where all the things that

60
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.680 
happen during a business process
are actually conducted.

61
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.740 
And now a very important observation.
We can now make a very important

62
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.670 
observation and that
observation is as follows -

63
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.370 
unfortunately, the assumption that the
process is executed exactly as defined

64
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.720 
is not always met. It's
actually very often violated.

65
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.060 
And this is where process mining
comes into the picture. So,

66
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.720 
in process mining we find out
what really happened during the

67
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.980 
execution of a business process. And we
use data that it was created during

68
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.390 
business process executions. And if
you look at real world scenarios,

69
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.620 
we find that data is stored in a
lot of heterogeneous data sources.

70
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.360 
So, we extended our sketch from
the last slide a little bit

71
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.590 
in the sense that we see it during
business process executions or

72
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.740 
business process execution
environment creates a number of

73
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.930 
files and documents. So, here
we might have text files,

74
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.760 
we might have also database tables
and we might have spreadsheet

75
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.360 
documents and forms and what have you. So
it's a very very broad and open field

76
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.680 
of elements, of data
sources that we find

77
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.310 
in these scenarios.

78
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.670 
It's important that we can do process mining
if we have this blueprint process model,

79
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160 
but we can also do process mining if we
do not have it, because we might have

80
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.720 
a situation where we do not have
a blueprint business process

81
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.450 
model. We just have the process
execution environment and even

82
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.350 
in these cases we can use process
mining to find out what a

83
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.810 
process model would look like. And then we
can derive important valuable information

84
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.370 
from the data.

85
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.730 
So, process mining provides methods
and techniques to investigate

86
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.910 
what really happened during the
execution of a business process.

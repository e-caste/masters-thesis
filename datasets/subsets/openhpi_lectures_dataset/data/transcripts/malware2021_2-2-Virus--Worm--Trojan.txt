1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.330 
In our openHPI course Cyberthreats by
Malware, now we consider the different types

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.690 
of malware and the characteristics.
There is virus, worm and trojan -

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.870 
and there's so many
different malware. And they,

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.210 
every day you can read in the newspaper
from a new attack that was

5
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.930 
created or forced by malware, whether
it's computer systems that

6
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.060 
are taken down by a virus or
here also a corona virus spam mail

7
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.240 
enterprises[Whitepaper]. So there are so
many activities and what we

8
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.670 
want to do is to have a closer
look in the course of this week

9
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.000 
to the different types of malware.
So here it's the first overview.

10
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.330 
So malware from type virus. Virus -
it is a malware that attaches

11
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.560 
itself to a program
or to a file;

12
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.780 
this is called the host, and then spread
further to other program files

13
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.270 
when this program is started
or when this file is open.

14
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.140 
So, the user has to do something
in case of a virus infection.

15
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.300 
He has to start the program or he has
to open the file and in that moment

16
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.380 
the infected
host, the virus

17
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.640 
infects the whole
system of the victim.

18
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.810 
The severity
ranges from some

19
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.700 
only causing annoying effects up
to a real damage of data or

20
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.040 
of software or
even of hardware.

21
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.940 
Often a virus is also
used as a general

22
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.260 
name, as again general
term for malware. So the

23
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.780 
definition is not so
clear, but in the

24
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.500 
experts' discussion virus are
such small attachments that come

25
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.630 
together with a program or a file and
that start to do there infection

26
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.410 
by some action
of the user. So,

27
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.470 
when people speak
in general

28
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.670 
instead of malware, they speak
of virus it's also okay and is

29
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.130 
also done in the public.

30
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.270 
Another type of
malware are worms.

31
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.810 
The worm is a malware that can
spread its copies over the internet,

32
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.100 
over the network or
the internet on its own.

33
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.930 
In contrast to a virus,
here is no activity from the side

34
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.630 
of the user necessary.

35
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.760 


36
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.170 
The attacker starts infection by exploiting
some vulnerability of the target systems

37
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.380 
or the victim
is tricked to execute

38
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.220 
malware or follow
a link or

39
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.440 
open an attachment and then the
worm infection starts and then it

40
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.990 
copies itself over the
internet by its own.

41
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.260 
So it functions independently.
It does not need a host

42
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.430 
or human to replicate
to do something

43
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.430 
and often worms spread much
faster over the internet than

44
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.170 
viruses. Here is
an example

45
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.170 
where you can see the infection
and the speed of the infection.

46
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.210 
It was code red from two thousand
one and you see from single

47
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.720 
machines over a short time, all over
the world the infection is spread

48
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.570 
and more and more
systems are infected

49
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.930 
and really damaged. This is
not an animation.

50
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.220 
This is really a simulation how this
called red spread out over the internet

51
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.860 
in two thousand one.

52
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.060 
To give an example of
such a worm malware,

53
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.660 
this is the ILOVEYOU form that
became very popular and famous

54
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.210 
due to the
damage it did.

55
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.760 
ILOVEYOU was a worm that uses
social engineering techniques

56
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.990 
to infect users
via email.

57
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.650 
And it was emails which were
sent with the subject ILOVEYOU.

58
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.850 
and if a human gets
such an email, then

59
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.830 
he is curious. What is it,
who sent it and what is it.

60
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.870 
And this ILOVEYOU email
had an attachment

61
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.660 
of an alleged

62
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.570 
love letter for you. And
here you see something

63
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.360 
special. So typically, if it's only
text then it should be finished at

64
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.540 
text but it is a vbs

65
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.570 
which shows that it is not a
text, that it is a basic script,

66
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.610 
a visual Basic script and this
visual Basic script contains

67
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.040 
that when it's executed, then
the malicious program code,

68
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.500 
when the attachment is opened, the
malicious code is started to be executed.

69
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.060 
The file extension
here tells you,

70
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.810 
one could check that this is not
a text, that is not a love

71
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.960 
letter as it claims to be,
that this is a script.

72
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
So typically people are not aware of this
and then they are interested of course,

73
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.290 
who sends me a love
letter and then

74
00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.990 
the ILOVEYOU worm
does its infection work.

75
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
And what is the
functionality, what is done

76
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.500 
the malware looks to the
email address of the

77
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.310 
infected system

78
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.980 
and then sends its love
letter to all the

79
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.960 
contacts that are
in the email address

80
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.600 
book of the
infected user.

81
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.640 
So then the email comes of course
with the sender address

82
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.900 
from the email, so always
a real person.

83
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.150 
The address is the name of the
infected user that's not aware

84
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.770 
that his system sends such love letters,
such love letter malware attacks

85
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:54.080 
to the people, he knows and he works
together and which are stored in his

86
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.870 
or her address book -

87
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.560 
email address book.

88
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.540 
Another here is a Safety
Mask that is a worm,

89
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.110 
a worm with a similar concept
as ILOVEYOU. Here it

90
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.840 
is a safety mask, it sends
you a message - get safety from

91
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.380 
corona virus by using face mask,
click on this link. Click on

92
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.020 
this link and download app and order
your face mask. And of course this link

93
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.310 
is not a link to a shop selling
mask, it is a link

94
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.440 
to a website
prepared by the

95
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.030 
cybercriminals and if
the link is clicked,

96
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.900 
then the maalware, the
infection is done.

97
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.280 
So the target will receive an SMS and
download and install an application

98
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.500 
from the attached links and
now the phone address book

99
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.910 
of the smartphone is used to distribute,
is used by the worm by the malware

100
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.970 
to distribute
itself via sms,

101
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.750 
to contact people of
the infected system.

102
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.690 
Another famous type of
malware is our Trojan.

103
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.220 
A Trojan is a malware

104
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.260 
that disguises itself as a
genuine and useful application

105
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:25.810 
but it is not. It is a trick. It is
a trick to force a target

106
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.980 
to install it and later
on the Trojans, the malware

107
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:36.870 
does its work. Also the Trojans
can infect all types of devices,

108
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.540 
as they contain hidden
malicious functions

109
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.070 
unknown to the
target. They

110
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.550 
come to tell - here is a functionality
that's very helpful for you,

111
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.370 
and behind that

112
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.670 
useful functionality, the malware
is hidden, installed, so

113
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.210 
like a Trojan Earth, there is
something inside coming with

114
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.630 
this Trojan Earth,
which are, you know,

115
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.050 
are the soldiers, in that
case it's a malware

116
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.420 
and this malware download,

117
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.720 
then even other malwares
open backdoors or do different

118
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.850 
malicious things. So the malicious
function is executed in parallel

119
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:31.030 
to the expected functionality. So
the user is not aware. The user

120
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.830 
looks for a
functionality, it

121
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.520 
clicks on to start this
functionality and this click also

122
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.920 
is a click to start
download of Malware

123
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:53.290 
Trojan. So here, different
to worms its not replicating

124
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.100 
itself or its not
infecting other files,

125
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:06.090 
it is a functionality. It hides the functionality
behind some useful functionality

126
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.900 
that is malicious.

127
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.610 
To look to an example,

128
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.310 
the trojans they have very
different objectives,

129
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.780 
like for example installing a back
door. Later on we will discuss

130
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.320 
back doors in more detail. Back
doors open the possibility,

131
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.730 
make it possible for the attacker to
get access to the victim's system,

132
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:37.800 
remote access to the victim,
cybercriminals can even remotely control

133
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.270 
the system of the user and can
install software, open files,

134
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.160 
look to data or do others. So
with the intrusion such a back

135
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.170 
door can be installed
or Trojans can

136
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.170 
lead to installing the spyware.

137
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.110 
The spyware which monitors and sends
information off the victim's

138
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.390 
systems by capturing keyboard
typing or by gaining access to

139
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.070 
microphone or webcam or others.

140
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.650 
Also Botnet aims

141
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.240 
to infect systems, to make
them bots of a botnet. It

142
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.260 
can be done by such
Trojan malware.

143
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.190 
And the idea here is to
add the victim's system

144
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.850 
to a network of other hijacked
and remote control systems,

145
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.610 
then to launch other cyber attacks for
example denial-of-service attacks or others.

146
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.200 
Another functionality, hidden functionality
in a Trojan it could be a downloader.

147
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.420 
A downloader for
installing other malware to

148
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.330 
affected systems. For example
such as ransomware or worms or others.

149
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.530 
As an example, I will

150
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.480 
introduce a BlackNET Trojan.

151
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.970 
This was a Trojan, or is a
Trojan that usually utilizes

152
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.940 
the COVID-19 pandemic situation.

153
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:22.840 
So it utilizes a phishing website that
encourage users to download software

154
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:28.460 
to protect their computer against
a COVID-19 virus.

155
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.980 
Of course this is not true. So
what the designer of the Trojan

156
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.100 
want to reach is that the user
makes a download from that web.

157
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.030 
Now to download here the
offered corona antivirus,

158
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.880 
and of course this is a malware and
in the moment the user downloads it,

159
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.330 
it infects the system. So
you see how perfect this

160
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.650 
cybercriminals are
to misuse the

161
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:04.190 
problems people have with such
a pandemic, to promise something

162
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:09.850 
we will help you. He simply
downloads the software,

163
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:15.260 
other offers are for example
download software to get statistics

164
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.740 
about infections
around you or others.

165
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.870 
Then when the software has been
installed from that malicious website,

166
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.540 
then the infected computer becomes a bot
that can be controlled by the hacker.

167
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.890 
We will speak about such botnets
in more detail in another clip.

168
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:43.610 
So BlackNET RAT is capable of launching
distributed denial-of-service attacks,

169
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.880 
taking screenshots from your computer,
stealing passwords, cookies

170
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.210 
and bitcoin wallets.

171
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.240 
This gives a first overview about
the different types of malware

172
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.900 
and about the attack vectors of
that malware. Most modern malware

173
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.840 
comes with a mixture of
such functionality.

174
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:13.180 
We will discuss this in
more clips in this week.

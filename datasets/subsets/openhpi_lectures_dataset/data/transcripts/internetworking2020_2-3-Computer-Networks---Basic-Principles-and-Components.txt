00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.460 
In our openhpi course "A Half
Century of Internet" we continue

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.260 
to look to computer networks and consider
some basic principle and components.

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.400 
These are the devices belonging to a
computer network. The end device

4
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.890 
or basic components,
intermediate systems

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.390 
and the physical
connections.

6
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.810 
If we have a closer look
then end devices,

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.520 
typically these are the basic
components. These are the smart

8
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.970 
devices, the laptops where the
user wants, where the user

9
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.500 
put in information and
get out information

10
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.220 
which are which they exchange
with other devices.

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.480 
Technically this systems
are called hosts.

12
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.320 
Hosts are the end devices of the network.
Then we need intermediate systems,

13
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.420 
infrastructure
components for

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.050 
cabling the computer
to the networks

15
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.330 
and provides some other services
for example interconnection

16
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.820 
with the routing which compute the
transport paths through the internet

17
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.450 
with switches and repeaters that a
technical system need to organize

18
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
the communication over
such computer networks.

19
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280 
And then as a third basic component
we need a physical connection.

20
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.810 
These are the
carrier medium.

21
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.160 
Typically this is wiring, radio
connections, in ethernet

22
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.720 
we already know it's cable, in wifi
it's radio. So these are the

23
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.690 
basic components.

24
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.460 
How is the organization? The
communication is organized between

25
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.530 
the host, between the host and
the intermediate system.

26
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.490 
Aand when we look to the computer networks
and the predominant communication

27
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.920 
principle is so called
client server paradigm.

28
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.470 
Here we have an image of such a network and
in such networks the different devices

29
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.350 
play different roles.
There are two roles.

30
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.990 
The one role for a host is the
role of a server and the other

31
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.080 
role which a host can play
is a role of a client.

32
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.830 
The server that's a component that
offers resources, for example

33
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.260 
offers a website or
offers a space for

34
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.760 
a space for saving

35
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
and they offer services for clients
and the clients on the other side

36
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.760 
they are the service users which use
the services offered by the server.

37
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.580 
And now to model a communication
between the different

38
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.180 
systems connected to such a computer
network as a client server

39
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.960 
paradigm describes modelizes a
communication in the following way:

40
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.250 
the client every time takes the
initiative and requests services

41
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.780 
which are offered by a server. So the
client connects to the server and request

42
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.090 
a certain it is certain the
resource which is offered by

43
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.480 
the server, a website, the search
result, a database query.

44
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.360 
So the client can contact different
servers for different resources

45
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.560 
and the servers can offer their
services for different clients.

46
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.970 
But the server every
time is waiting

47
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.360 
that it is contacted by a
client and then it responses.

48
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.710 
But of course the server also checks
whether the client is also authorized

49
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.370 
to use the servers before
sending the servers.

50
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.880 
So this is a simplification of the
very complex communication process.

51
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.790 
The two components client server,
client is active part he starts

52
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.070 
to request some resources from
server, server is waiting for

53
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.180 
such kind of repairs and
answers with replies, with

54
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.480 
the sending back the resource
which was requested

55
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.030 
by the client. And then next
communication cycle can become.

56
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.810 
So there is a simplification
of the communication.

57
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.040 
Of course which role a host is
playing that can change during

58
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.120 
over the time. So a host in
certain situation can be

59
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.290 
he can be a client requesting
information from another host

60
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.710 
and in other situations the hosts
can play can be the server

61
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.720 
that request to other clients
by a certain resource.

62
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.350 
How are the communications line used?
And here we have two principles,

63
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.400 
the line switching and
packet switching.

64
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.930 
In computer networks typically
we see the package switching

65
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.520 
in telephone networks, in analog
telephone networks we see

66
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.380 
the line switching. Let's have a
closer look to the line switching.

67
00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.330 
The two communication partners which one to
connect and one to exchange information,

68
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:11.300 
they are connected via a line
and this line is only it's

69
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.380 
only be used by this to sender and receiver
by the two communication partners.

70
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:26.380 
Even if they do not exchange information,
this line is a connection is in place.

71
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.680 
So messages can be transmitted of
any length. It does not play

72
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.890 
any role, whether it's a long message
or shorter message the both partners

73
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.360 
can do this in this
line switching

74
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.910 
situation as they want.

75
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.140 
So what they need to do in the
beginning to start communication

76
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.400 
is to establish such a line,
such a communication line and

77
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.480 
then they can send
and receive data.

78
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.400 
This is similar like you know
from a telephone call. You

79
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.200 
call someone and then you are
connected, you can call as long

80
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:13.360 
as you like, you can send information you
like, important is that you and the

81
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.810 
receiver of this your partner
have the same understanding

82
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.450 
of such kind of
information.

83
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.190 
The other principle is the packet switching
and in case for packet switching

84
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:36.180 
this is in place when the various
hosts use connection lines together

85
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.620 
and use it simultaneously
for their information.

86
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.660 
Before being transmitted in case
of packet switching the message

87
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.210 
are broke down into
short data packets.

88
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.650 
The data packets have a specified length
and they have a specified structure.

89
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.190 
This length and structure is defined
by the communication protocol

90
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.610 
of this packet
switching technology.

91
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.230 
And then these packages are sent
over such kind of network.

92
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.220 
You see there are different
connections and here for example

93
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:22.220 
is the first packet is sent, and then over
this path it is reaching the receiver.

94
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.810 
The second package goes over this path
and then we have a third package

95
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.660 
and they are transmitted
over the net.

96
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.550 
So the users can send data package
via the network infrastructure

97
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.330 
regardless of which message
this package belonged to.

98
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:48.870 
This has the advantage that here I
showed only to sender and receiver

99
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.300 
two partners in such a network,
but typically in such an for

100
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.390 
example ethernetwork there are hundreds of
people that want to exchange information

101
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:05.250 
and in this way by having this package links
the infrastructure the network infrastructure

102
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:12.080 
can be used a very efficiently. Everyone can
send is packaged as soon as possibility

103
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:19.250 
of a free a of a free line and
there are intermediate systems

104
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.380 
and the intermediate system can
store this packet before sending

105
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:29.490 
on the next step. So this is typically
how computer networks are organized

106
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:36.730 
and if you compare then it's
comparable to sending parcels on the

107
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:46.060 
post office. So reminder, the data
package the informations and messages,

108
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:52.590 
which are sent over the infrastructure
they are encoded as bit sequences,

109
00:09:52.910 --> 00:10:00.350 
as sequences of zero and ones,
and the zero and ones were

110
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.450 
organised were sent in form
of physical signals.

111
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.250 
So the one is represented by a light
or electrical impulse and zero

112
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.490 
by no light no impulse.

113
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:21.250 
So to send a message to send a bit
sequence over a computer networks

114
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.030 
the following needs
to be done.

115
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.450 
This bit sequence need to be
translated in a sequence of

116
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.370 
physical signals

117
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:40.190 
translation. By the way this is done in
your computer network card because

118
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.300 
inside the computer the computer
is working with a bit sequence

119
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.790 
but the network and the cable
connection or the radio connection

120
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:56.010 
they can only transport a
sequence of physical signals.

121
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.530 
So the bit sequence need
to be translated in a

122
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:08.800 
a sequence of physical signals. Then
the signal sequence is transmitted

123
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.880 
over the carrier medium. This
could be a cable, this could be

124
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.590 
a cable system, this could be a wire,
this could be a radio information.

125
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.930 
And then the receiver can
receive this information, can

126
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.560 
receive this sequence
of physical signals.

127
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.520 
The network card of the receiver can
translate a sequence of physical

128
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:40.180 
physical signals into bit
sequence and the bit sequence

129
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.610 
then can be processed.

130
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:49.260 
If we look to the carrier media then really
there are very different possibilities.

131
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:56.120 
Very often we see a copper cable or fibre
optic cable but also radio waves,

132
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:04.270 
infrared even a war or other kind
for a binary system could be used

133
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.420 
to transport
information.

134
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:13.390 
So the different carrier media are adapted
to the case of application, to the

135
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.910 
characteristics the
user wants to have.

136
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:27.900 
So physical transmission media never
work without arrows because when the

137
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.090 
bits are transmitted
into signals.

138
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.820 
For example light signals or
electrical signals then during

139
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.070 
the transport through the carrier
something could happen.

140
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:48.800 
So additional mechanisms are needed
for error detection and correction

141
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.740 
to make it possible that the
receiver receives the data

142
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.670 
in the right way or at least as
a receiver can recognize that

143
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.890 
some of the information was damaged
during the transport case.

144
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:12.860 
The physical signals weaken during a
transmission. This is also one reason

145
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:20.480 
for some problems. So the distance is
very important for the right distance

146
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:26.700 
so that the receiver can receive
the data in a way that he

147
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:33.230 
without any error can translate this pack
into a zero one signals. Here you see

148
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.120 
it's a radio a it's a radio connection
and when the distance is too long

149
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.590 
the signals become weaker weaker
weaker weaker weaker, and it's

150
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.130 
for the receiver system

151
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:51.000 
difficult or impossible
to understand the

152
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.250 
bits zero and one
behind the signal.

153
00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:01.760 
For that reason intermediate stations
are needed to refresh the signal

154
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.060 
if it has to be sent over long
distance so that the receiver can

155
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.570 
errorless interpret
the signal.

156
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.580 
So this intermediate systems are
installed in network nodes,

157
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:24.640 
they perform relay or amplifier
functions and decide

158
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:31.710 
also on the further transport
paths of such a data stream

159
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.240 
we will have a closer
look later on.

160
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:40.250 
Now let's have a look to
the network adapters,

161
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:47.540 
also called communication interphases,
network card, network interface

162
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.580 
there are many
names in place.

163
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.840 
This hardware devices
are required

164
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.650 
to connect host computer smart
device to a computer network.

165
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:07.010 
The network adapter has to
perform different tasks.

166
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.870 
First the network adapter
translate some message

167
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.690 
the bit string to
be communicated

168
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:25.010 
in a sequence of a in a
sequence of physical signals

169
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.490 
and to help the receiver to
understand when was the beginning

170
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.580 
this sequence need to be
a very specific format.

171
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:41.050 
So the translation of the message in
such type of network specific format

172
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:48.190 
is the first task, then the data
package this network format

173
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:55.050 
is a sequence of zeros and ones needs
to be translated in a signal sequence

174
00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.400 
and then this signal the physical signal
sequence is transported is sent out

175
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.650 
and transported via the carrier
meeting to the receiver.

176
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:14.200 
If you look to a laptop then your
laptop has different type of network

177
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:20.770 
adapters. For example if you have a windows
system then a network connections

178
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:26.760 
are done in IP config, there are
bluetooth network connections

179
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.200 
there is ethernet type,
there is wifi connection.

180
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:38.290 
If you have a MAC OS computer then
there are wi-fi there are bluetooth

181
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:45.060 
there is uthunderbird bridge, if
you have a linux. So each type of

182
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.010 
computer of course otherwise you could not
connect your computer to the internet

183
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.430 
has different types of network
adapters and this different

184
00:16:54.430 --> 00:17:01.410 
types of network adapters use different
type of carriers for sending

185
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.490 
the data and receiving the data
inside the network from a source.

186
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.990 
So these are some basic
principles and components

187
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.530 
which make it possible
that bit strings

188
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:25.290 
can be transmitted over networks in form of
a strings of sequences of physical signals

189
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.860 
to another computer, to another
smart device which is able to

190
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.400 
re encode this sequence of physical
signals into the bit string

191
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.960 
which encodes
your message.

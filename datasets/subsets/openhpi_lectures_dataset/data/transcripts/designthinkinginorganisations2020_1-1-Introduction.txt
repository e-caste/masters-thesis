00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:17.090 
Welcome to our OpenHPI course
on mastering Design Thinking.

2
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.920 
My name is Falk Ubernickel, I'm a professor
at the Hasso Plattner Institute

3
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.600 
for innovation research
and design thinking.

4
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.810 
And my name is Danielly De Paula,
I'm originally from Brazil

5
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.330 
and I have a background in computer science
and a PhD in industrial engineering

6
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.190 
from the National University
of Ireland in Galway.

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.110 
Now I am a postdoc here at the
Hasso Plattner Institute.

8
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840 
Based on our experience, this Open
HPI course will help you to

9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.950 
become a better leader in managing
design thinking in your organization.

10
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.310 
In particular, we have the following
learning objectives, first,

11
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.660 
a comprehensive overview of how Design Thinking
is implemented in different organizations,

12
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.180 
secondly, we will address an
understanding of how to implement,

13
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.790 
enact and embody design thinking and
organizations based on successful cases.

14
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
Thirdly, we will talk about how to
support and empower employees

15
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.990 
to use design thinking to promote
change. And lastly, we will

16
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.120 
talk about how to measure and customize the
process to account for business goals

17
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.720 
in organizational
culture.

18
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.050 
To cover all topics our team
has developed during the last

19
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.560 
year a comprehensive framework
for the management of design

20
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.320 
thinking, as you can see on the
graphic, each dimension of the

21
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.170 
framework is important for a successful
design and implementation.

22
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.040 
Let's have a quick look
at each dimension,

23
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
the first dimension of our
implementation will be a strategy

24
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.700 
in this model, we will learn
about how to set up a strategy

25
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.190 
of how design thinking can
unfold in organizations

26
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.290 
for instance, what are the main
drivers for design thinking on

27
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.640 
a strategic level and what are the
critical success factors and inhibitors

28
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.050 
for setting up a designing strategy
for this dimension. We have

29
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.090 
invited doctor Tamara Carleton from
Stanford University to share

30
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.080 
her experiences
on the topic.

31
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.150 
In the dimension of education,
training, and resources we will

32
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.990 
cover the fundamental practices
that support the development

33
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.950 
of a long term internal design
capability and we hope that

34
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.320 
you will be inspired by
new ways of working.

35
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.030 
For that, we also talked with
Christian Steiger from the Haufe

36
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.960 
group, where he shared his main
learnings about the transformation

37
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.480 
that his company
successfully went through.

38
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.930 
In the dimension of organizational
inquiry and business model,

39
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.990 
we will learn about how to shape
the business model for design

40
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.080 
thinking and innovation in
organizations. In the dimension of

41
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.640 
spaces and team composition, we
will discuss how the future

42
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.600 
of spaces for look like and how
to compose your dream team.

43
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.270 
For this topic, we have
talked to practitioners

44
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.270 
to discuss the future of space, we talked
with Raphael Gielgen from Vitra

45
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.990 
and we also talked with professor
Christine Thong from the

46
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.550 
Swinburne University about the
topic of the dream team.

47
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.680 
In the area of application dimension,
we will explore the different

48
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.980 
implementation areas of design
thinking processes and practices,

49
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.380 
will have an overview of our
designing process and understand

50
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.310 
the principles of
design thinking.

51
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.980 
To have a practical perspective
on the topic we talked with Dr.

52
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.420 
Florian Huber from PWC. As a part
of the leadership dimension,

53
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.430 
we will learn about how the organization and
culture can nurture design thinking successfully

54
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.620 
and also about the different leadership
styles for managing design thinking.

55
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.780 
For this, we talked
to Dr Hoseph Press.

56
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.900 
In the dimension of impact and
measure, we will learn about

57
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.440 
the different views on the topic
of measuring design thinking

58
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.550 
and discuss some ideas of what
could be measured and how,

59
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.140 
for this topic, we talked with
professor Pietro Micheli from

60
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.110 
the university of Warwick and professor
Jeanne Liedtka from the Darden school.

61
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.750 
In addition, we have set a model addressing
the potential of new technologies

62
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.370 
such as artificial intelligence,
we would like to give you an

63
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.190 
idea on what a combination of
high tech and design thinking

64
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.010 
can look like in
the future.

65
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.550 
Our guest speakers will be Dr
Christian Dremel from the University

66
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.350 
of Bamberg and Dr Li Jiang
from Stanford University.

67
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.450 
As you can see, we have prepared
some very special content for you

68
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.500 
that covers not only theory but also the main
learnings from experienced practitioners.

69
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.910 
A scientific foundation for the
proposed model we have conducted

70
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.980 
over the last year, a study with over five
hundred participants from global organizations.

71
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.570 
Later on, in the course, you will
see for most of the dimensions

72
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.470 
the results of
those studies.

73
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.160 
For each dimension, we have a
lecture and an interview with

74
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.920 
a thought leader in the field
prepared. In total each unit will

75
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.690 
take you roughly sixty minutes
per day. In addition, we will

76
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.660 
provide more materials at your
hand in case you want to learn

77
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.830 
more about the specific dimension.
In case you've finished a

78
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.960 
course successfully, you will
get a certificate at the end.

79
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.330 
We are now excited to start the
learning journey together with you.

80
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.620 
See you soon and enjoy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400 
After having so much research
heavy machine learning this

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.700 
morning,
blockchain is now

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.120 
also kind of the hyped topic
of the moment. I would like to

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.150 
give you a general overview
about the topic so that everybody

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.180 
can learn something on it and
for those of you who are more

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.220 
advanced already maybe there is
some nugget that you might take

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.260 
away as well. The whole
setting we are working in is

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.300 
the problem of
decentralizing trust. Then

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.340 
as you already know bitcoin,
cryptocurrencies are the main use

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.360 
case, the most popular
use case that made

11
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.420 
blockchain as widely spread
as it is at the moment.

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.450 
Of course we have
to discuss them,

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.490 
discuss a bit what is the
cryptography in cryptocurrencies

14
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.530 
and what is the new thing
about it, so the consensus

15
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.570 
algorithm. Then having this use
case we will turn more to the

16
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.610 
architecture, so blockchain as
a platform, an architectural

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
concept and then discuss
possible applications also in

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
the business context
beyond cryptocurrencies

19
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.730 
and discuss maybe some engineering
tradeoffs that we face if

20
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.760 
we want to design an application
on top of blockchain.

21
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.820 
Finally some discussion on use
case evaluation in the blockchain

22
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.860 
topics, which use
cases can we tackle

23
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.890 
with the blockchain technology,
what are the value drivers, where

24
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.940 
should we be careful, and how is
SAP positioned in this context.

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100 
Since you all know
bitcoin, I will be short

26
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.106 
on the motivation.
Basically if you consider

27
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:52.112 
money transfer so transfer
of money from one party to

28
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:56.116 
another one, see here Alice
and Bob. Then if they can meet

29
00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.119 
the problem is solved, if
they cannot meet, then they,

30
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.122 
for example because they're in
different positions different

31
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:06.126 
continents, then usually they
have to find a way in order to

32
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:10.130 
transact the money. Now
bitcoin provides a solution

33
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.135 
to this via an open peer to
peer network on the internet.

34
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.139 
Ideally we would like to have
a transfer from Alice to Bob

35
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.143 
via a series of
intermediaries on this network

36
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.146 
that help them to
transact the funds.

37
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.150 
Now on the
internet it's not a

38
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:34.154 
very trustworthy environment if
it's an open peer to peer network

39
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:38.158 
and even Alice and Bob might not
trust each other because actually

40
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.160 
they might not even
know each other. Now

41
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:45.165 
lets say the classical solution
to this kind of dilemma, that

42
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.167 
was already there
before the digital age,

43
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:51.171 
is the use have a central
intermediary. Banking

44
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:56.176 
arose in medieval age and
there it helps, so banks help

45
00:02:56.176 --> 00:03:00.180 
to create a chain of trust.
Alice trusts her bank

46
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.184 
and Bob trusts his bank
and so the bank fulfills

47
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:10.190 
the function to create trust in
an environment where otherwise

48
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.193 
the people do not trust each
other. Then we have this

49
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.196 
chain of bi-lateral trust that
helps actually to settle the

50
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:20.200 
funds. Now in
todays world

51
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.203 
things got a bit more
complicated if you have a

52
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:27.207 
international cross-border money
transfer then usually it's not

53
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.211 
only one bank but a whole series
of intermediaries in between.

54
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:36.216 
Then you have a chain of
bilateral trust relationships

55
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.219 
where actually one bank
doesn't really know,

56
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.222 
have to know about the
other ones as long as the

57
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:47.227 
direct partners are trustworthy.
All of these intermediaries

58
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.230 
take their part of the share,
so if you have a transaction

59
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.232 
all of them want to have
some part of the fees

60
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:57.237 
of the transaction
and due to this

61
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.239 
complicated process
via many intermediaries

62
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.242 
where the problem
that it takes,

63
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.245 
complicates the process, it
takes several days to settle this

64
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:09.249 
transaction and they might
misuse their power in

65
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.253 
the process, raising the
fees for example. Now ideally

66
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.256 
what we would like to have
is such a solution, so

67
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.259 
Aalice and Bob part of
the de-centralized network

68
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.263 
where there is no intermediary
that has power over the whole

69
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.267 
system but everything
is de-centralized and

70
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.270 
even though they don't trust
each other they can somehow find

71
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.275 
a way to set of the payment.
Now blockchain and bitcoin

72
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:39.279 
came up with a solution,
an algorithmic solution for

73
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.283 
this kind of setting that was not
possible in this de-centralized

74
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.286 
way before. This is
why all this hype

75
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.289 
has been created
around this topic.

76
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.295 
To set the terms of it,
bitcoin is a cryptocurrency

77
00:04:56.296 --> 00:05:00.300 
that uses encryption techniques
for the transfer of funds

78
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.303 
in a setting where you do
not have a central party

79
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:09.309 
and bitcoin is an application
of the architectural concept

80
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.313 
blockchain, so bitcoin and
blockchain are not the same thing.

81
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:17.317 
Pprobably you already know that but
in general this is not necessarily

82
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:21.321 
known. This architectural concept
enables this de-centralized

83
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:25.325 
secure transfer
of digital assets

84
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.329 
and blockchain itself
is just one type of

85
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.333 
distributed ledger technology.
This is the umbrella term

86
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:38.338 
where you have a consensus
of replicated shared

87
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:43.343 
digital data spread across
different countries or institutions

88
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.346 
and I want to focus
on institutions here.

89
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:52.352 
We will discuss these,
especially these aspect

90
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.354 
in terms of
de-centralization.

91
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.362 
We first will discuss the use
case of cryptocurrencies with

92
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:06.366 
the example of bitcoin, introduce
the concepts behind, and then

93
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.369 
later on go towards
the architectural

94
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:16.376 
concept of the blockchain. Now
bitcoin was proposed in this

95
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.379 
article in 2008 by
Satoshi Nakomoto

96
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.383 
and it was
basically a sketch

97
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.387 
of a digital currency that works
in a de-centralized setting.

98
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.390 
However it was not the
first proposed solution

99
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.395 
but the one that took off and it took
off because it solved a particular

100
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.399 
problem that we face in these
scenarios. There has been a lot of

101
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.403 
research, already since decades,
to create digital currencies.

102
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.407 
We all use it
with a visa

103
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:50.410 
cards and so on and
the main problem that

104
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.413 
we face, the main design
challenge in such a

105
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:57.417 
digital currency is the
double spent problem.

106
00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.420 
Now if you have, if you take a
picture and you want to share

107
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.423 
with their friends you can just
shared with everyone you want

108
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:07.427 
so you can easily copy this
digital piece of information

109
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.430 
and this is what we
all use. It's the

110
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.435 
nice thing about the internet,
now if we want to transact funds

111
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.439 
we better make sure that you
can just move it to transact it

112
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.442 
and not copy it because
otherwise you can print money.

113
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.445 
If I sent money from my
account to your account

114
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.448 
then you do not want that
the money that I sent you

115
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:33.453 
is still on my account.
This notion of transacting

116
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.456 
and not being able to
double spend a digital

117
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:40.460 
representation of value
is very complicated

118
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.465 
in a de-centralized
system. Historically this

119
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.469 
is solved via an intermediary,
so with your bank

120
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.474 
giving you basically the
EC card and then whoever

121
00:07:54.474 --> 00:08:00.480 
first spends a digital token
or coin at the bank then

122
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.484 
receives the payment.
When you come later

123
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.487 
then the money is already
spent and there is

124
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.491 
the central intermediary, the
bank that make sure that there's

125
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:15.495 
only one spending transaction. Now
if we want to go in a decentralized

126
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.498 
setting we do not have
this bank to make sure

127
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:22.502 
that there is only one
spending party. Now

128
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:27.507 
bitcoin proposed a
combination of existing

129
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:31.511 
technologies to solve this
problem in a rather ingenious way.

130
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.516 
It's not particularly new
technologies but the combination

131
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:40.520 
of all these things made up
some interesting features.

132
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.524 
You have this de-centralized
peer to peer network

133
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:49.529 
to set up the whole
system and they use

134
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.532 
private public key encryption
for signing, for actually setting

135
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:56.536 
up the cryptocurrency and they use
hashing algorithms to introduce

136
00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:01.541 
some tamper-proof
and notion of time

137
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:06.546 
properties. The idea, the
innovation basically is

138
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.549 
the combination of these existing
technologies with economic

139
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:13.553 
incentives. This combination
of technologies with

140
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:17.557 
economic incentives is what
we have to understand in order

141
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.560 
to see what the
innovation behind bitcoin

142
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.562 
or cryptocurrencies
was or is.

143
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.567 
We will first tackle the
definition what we understand

144
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.570 
under de-centralized,
what kind of

145
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.575 
cryptography we need in order
to set up such a cryptocurrency,

146
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.578 
where the hashing
algorithms come into play,

147
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:43.583 
and before that talk a
bit about the incentives

148
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.585 
that we need in order
to set up the system.

149
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:50.590 
Since 2008, a lot has
happened in this field

150
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.593 
so bitcoin is maybe the
most prominent example

151
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.597 
but by far not the only one and
it's a very rapidly evolving

152
00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.601 
field with a lot of
hype and therefore

153
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.605 
we do not restrict our
definition of blockchain

154
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.609 
to the bitcoin blockchain but would
rather give a broader definition

155
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.612 
within the scope of
this presentation here.

156
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.615 
The blockchain in
architectural concept

157
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.619 
of a distributed ledger, immutable
chain of blocks of tamper-proof

158
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.623 
transactions. I hope that by
the end of the lecture you

159
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.625 
will completely understand
what this sentence

160
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:33.633 
is meaning. Now as I said,
combining existing technologies

161
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.636 
with economic incentives
was the main innovation

162
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.639 
and it founded kind of
a field which we can

163
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:44.644 
term cryptoeconomics.
Cryptoeconomics

164
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.648 
is the combination of cryptography
and economic incentives

165
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:52.652 
to achieve whatever information
security goals you want to

166
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:56.656 
follow. With cryptography we
can prove things about ownership

167
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.659 
in the past, so we can for
example sign our emails

168
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.663 
and then the
receiver, the

169
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:07.667 
recipient of the mail can see
that it was actually us with

170
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.670 
the private key that signed
the mail and so on. It's about

171
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.674 
proving ownership in the
past. However if we want to

172
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:19.679 
avoid double spending and we want
to design this cryptocurrency

173
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:23.683 
and have some
properties basically

174
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:27.687 
propagate it into the future, we
can not do this with cryptography

175
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:32.692 
alone. The idea here is that we
include, in our systems, some

176
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.695 
economic incentives
so that people have

177
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:40.700 
incentives to behave in a way
that stabilizes the protocol

178
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.704 
as we want to have it. So with
economic incentives we can encourage

179
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.708 
people so that the
desired properties

180
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.711 
of the system hold into
the future, in terms of for

181
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.714 
cryptocurrencies these
would be the double spent,

182
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.717 
one aspect of this would
be the double spent.

183
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.721 
And by combining
these we achieve

184
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.724 
the system in a
decentralized fashion

185
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:09.000 
that allows us to have a
higher fault tolerance and more

186
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.732 
security. Because there are
many people or many parties that

187
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.735 
work together
independently of each other

188
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.740 
and so they have a full replication
of the data, everybody has

189
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.743 
the full blockchain on their
node if they participate

190
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.746 
fully in the network.
If someone drops off

191
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.750 
the network then the network
will still continue running so

192
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.753 
we have different
advantages of this

193
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:38.758 
decentralization. Now you probably
heard a lot about distributed

194
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:43.763 
databases already
and this nice

195
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:47.767 
two by two scheme kind of
illustrates what we want to,

196
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.770 
what we mean when we are
talking of decentralization

197
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.775 
here. Usually when we go from a
central database on one machine

198
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.778 
to a distributed database
on different machines

199
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.783 
then we talk about
architectural decentralization,

200
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.786 
These different machines, so
servers or nodes, however you

201
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:11.000 
want to call them might be located
even on different continents

202
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.794 
but usually they are within
the scope of one organization

203
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:20.800 
that wants the system to work.
It's a political centralization

204
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.804 
of this system.
These nodes

205
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.807 
work together in
order to solve

206
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.810 
the multi concurrent
write problem so if you

207
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.814 
have different nodes
that share the data or

208
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.818 
that spin up the database and
people want to insert values

209
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.821 
and you have conflicting write
access, then you need somehow

210
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.824 
a method to resolve
the problem.

211
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.828 
If everybody works
together, so you have

212
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:53.833 
kind of collaboration of the
contributing, the constituting

213
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:58.838 
nodes, then you are, for example,
in this state machine replication

214
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:03.843 
research about distributed
databases. Now in a scenario where

215
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.846 
on the database

216
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.853 
there is basically your account
balance and everybody is in a different

217
00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:17.857 
political institution and wants
to increase their account balance

218
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.860 
on the database, then you have
competing write access and you

219
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.863 
no longer can assume that
people work together.

220
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:27.867 
You have a different setting of
a political de-centralization,

221
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:32.872 
it could be anybody of
us who runs this node and

222
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.875 
we all want basically to increase
our account balance and we will

223
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.878 
not stick to the protocol
unless we have some

224
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.882 
disadvantages. Now in this
setting, blockchains provide

225
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:48.888 
a solution to this different
case. I'm going from here to

226
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.892 
here, we go from a politically
centralized or cooperating

227
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.896 
write access to a computing politically
de-centralized write access.

228
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.902 
This raises problems
or questions. If you

229
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.905 
have de-centralized systems then
questions arise, so who maintains

230
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:09.909 
the system, who has
authority over what is valid,

231
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.912 
what kind of write
actions are valid.

232
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.915 
If you have this
cryptocurrency who can create

233
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:19.919 
the coins because if anybody
can create coins then

234
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.922 
they will probably have
no value in the end.

235
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:27.927 
If you want to
roll out an update

236
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.930 
or change the rules of the
system, who may determine that?

237
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.934 
These are questions that are
trivial in a politically centralized

238
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:38.938 
system, but are not easy to answer in
a politically de-centralized system.

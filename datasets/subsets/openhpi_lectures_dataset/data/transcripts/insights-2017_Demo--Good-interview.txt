00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:09.400 
- Hey Basta, thanks that you

2
00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:11.410 
could make it for this interview,

3
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.790 
and that you agreed to volunteer

4
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:14.150 
and found the time for it.

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.520 
So, I just wanted to quickly

6
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:18.600 
remind you what this is all for.

7
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:20.990 
I'm working on a research project,

8
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:22.080 
and I'm looking into,

9
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:25.440 
how do people go about when they're looking for a job.

10
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:29.340 
And I'm still trying to see,

11
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.480 
where are the problems and the challenges

12
00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.500 
there for different people.

13
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.600 
So I've prepared some questions,

14
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.010 
but at any time if anything is unclear

15
00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:40.200 
or you have a question,

16
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:41.780 
please let me know.

17
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:43.790 
- OK.

18
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.280 
- And I would like to do a recording of this,

19
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.140 
because I don't have a second person who could help me out

20
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.750 
taking notes. And the recording,

21
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:56.070 
though will be just for my personal use

22
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:57.770 
to listen to it again

23
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:58.710 
after the interview.

24
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.950 
- OK. So you won't publish it?

25
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.450 
- No it won't be... - At YouTube?

26
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.230 
- No no, it won't be on any social media or anywhere.

27
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.680 
It's just for personal documentation.

28
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.360 
- Good. - Is that okay?

29
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.210 
- Yeah.

30
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.760 
- Before I start the recording,

31
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:16.670 
I also just want to point out,

32
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:17.580 
there is no right

33
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.880 
or wrong answer to any of the questions that I'm asking.

34
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.400 
So it's really I want to get to know your personal stories,

35
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.050 
your personal experiences

36
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.860 
when it comes to looking for a job.

37
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.630 
- OK. I'm ready.

38
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:30.290 
- You're ready?

39
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:31.170 
- Just ask me anything.

40
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:32.890 
- Alright, so I'll start the recording.

41
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.500 
It's recording now.

42
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:37.950 
Basta, I would like to know,

43
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:39.990 
could you tell me about the last time

44
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:41.440 
you were looking for a job?

45
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:48.150 
- OK. My last time I was looking for a job was

46
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:51.040 
some weeks ago.

47
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.420 
Actually, I'd like to change careers.

48
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.890 
Basically, I just set a job alert. And then

49
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:01.760 
I get every day

50
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.530 
some proposals.

51
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.500 
- OK. Can you walk me through the process?

52
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.770 
So you sign up...

53
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.370 
...what exactly happens when you go to job alert?

54
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:14.560 
- I go to the website

55
00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:19.050 
and there I define some key words like where I do want to work,

56
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:21.780 
and what kind of job, what title.

57
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:24.570 
And every day based on this selection,

58
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:26.420 
they are going through the internet,

59
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:29.580 
looking for proposals and send me some proposals.

60
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:33.330 
- And what do you do from there?

61
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.970 
So you get the proposals...

62
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:36.970 
- I look through it,

63
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:38.320 
look what interests me,

64
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:44.140 
and then interesting ones, I copy the URL to an excel sheet.

65
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.800 
And then I look up the requirements,

66
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:48.360 
write them out,

67
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:50.860 
and have a look on my CV what

68
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:53.690 
in my CV fits to this requirement.

69
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:56.390 
And based on this I'm

70
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.610 
writing a motivation letter.

71
00:03:00.301 --> 00:03:01.320 
- OK, interesting.

72
00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:02.580 
So you are matching

73
00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:06.750 
what you find in the requirements to what you already

74
00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:07.730 
did in the past. - Yeah.

75
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.000 
- But where exactly do you choose

76
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:16.650 
then where to apply for? - Well, basically

77
00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:19.830 
I look up if I like the language they use,

78
00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:22.040 
if the company fits to me,

79
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:23.170 
you know, there is a kind of,

80
00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:24.890 
old German corporate language

81
00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:26.690 
they use which is just

82
00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:29.590 
not that interesting.

83
00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:33.130 
But I think the most interesting ones,

84
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.180 
I found on design consultancies,

85
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:40.380 
because they really know how to write a proposal.

86
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:41.930 
- OK. What is important

87
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:43.740 
when it comes to your job or to

88
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:45.470 
the job that you're applying for?

89
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:48.740 
What are the criteria, besides the language

90
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:49.970 
that you already mentioned,

91
00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:53.560 
like what is important for you to want to work in this job?

92
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:59.320 
- Well, for me very important is that I can bring in my

93
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:01.030 
whole personality and my ideas,

94
00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:02.840 
and can work them out.

95
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:09.050 
That's also what makes job searching so difficult for me,

96
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:13.750 
because to really find something what suits my criteria

97
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:15.160 
is very difficult, because there...

98
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:18.270 
there are a lot. Like I want to do this and that and that.

99
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:21.450 
And it has gone so far that

100
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:25.270 
in the end I stopped to look for jobs and start to freelance,

101
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:28.730 
and just write proposals to companies

102
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:30.700 
I think they're interesting.

103
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:32.540 
And they got some ideas,

104
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:34.780 
what can be done in their work.

105
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.430 
- Alright, so if I listen to you,

106
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:40.460 
is it that you kind of turned around the way

107
00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:41.740 
you were looking for jobs?

108
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:43.560 
Beforehand you were always

109
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:46.310 
looking for something that people proposed.

110
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.400 
And now you just turned the whole process,

111
00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:51.000 
and you're proposing.

112
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:52.320 
- Yeah, actually yes.

113
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:54.110 
- OK, wow, that's interesting!

114
00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:58.270 
What is your best experience?

115
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:00.790 
Can you share how this is like...

116
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.670 
how this is helping you in a way to find new jobs? - What?

117
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.240 
- the writing your proposal.

118
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:12.160 
- Well...

119
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.490 
...normally when I just answer to proposals,

120
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:17.370 
I'm limited to what they offer.

121
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:20.890 
And when I propose something to other companies,

122
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:25.840 
my ideas, I'm not limited. I can do whatever I want

123
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.790 
and see what comes back.

124
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:27.740 
- OK.

125
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:31.340 
So, why do you do that?

126
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:32.940 
Why do you do that on the long run?

127
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:37.100 
- Well basically, I think it's...

128
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:40.230 
it can be hell to work somewhere,

129
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:41.800 
where I don't belong to or where I

130
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.910 
don't feel comfortable.

131
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.730 
And so as I don't like to be in hell...

132
00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:48.870 
I sweat very fast when it's hot. [laughter]

133
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:53.710 
Yeah, I prefer to write my proposals,

134
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:55.410 
what idea I have so far,

135
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:59.620 
with this company and write, how do you say

136
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.570 
an offer? - Yeah, an offer...you mean when you propose?

137
00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:05.120 
- I would propose them a project and see.

138
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.020 
if they work out or not.

139
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:13.110 
- Alright, there are already interesting findings in there,

140
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:14.610 
like interesting things you mentioned... - Thank you.

141
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.480 
- ...that I didn't think about when I started this project.

142
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:21.510 
I'm really happy with what I heard.

143
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:23.970 
But I would also like to give you the chance

144
00:06:23.971 --> 00:06:25.230 
if anything popped up,

145
00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:26.980 
if you have a comment, a question,

146
00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:28.910 
something you want to share now?

147
00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:30.460 
- Yeah, I want to share,

148
00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:34.880 
never give up to find the thing

149
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.090 
what really interests you,

150
00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:39.360 
because life is too short to do rubbish stuff.

151
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:41.880 
- Alright. - Never forget.

152
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:43.940 
- Yeah, I will keep it in mind.

153
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.990 
- Good. - Thank you. - Thank you.

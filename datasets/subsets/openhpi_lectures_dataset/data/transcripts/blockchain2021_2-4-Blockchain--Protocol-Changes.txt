00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.020 
In our openHPI course
Blockchain: Revealing the Myth",

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.850 
now we want to consider scalability
or the average efficiency of a

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.270 
blockchain based system and
to what extent we can modify

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.700 
and influence this
scalability and efficiency.

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.210 
We have understood the ideas and
the goals of the blockchain

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.180 
based system, we considered in more
detail Bitcoin and Ethereum system

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.890 
and we understood the
technical solutions behind it

8
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.460 
and we have understood the
blockchain technology.

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.610 
And now we see that the blockchain
technology is trying to adapt to

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.880 
many different application
areas, to various needs

11
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.670 
and we see that it becomes more and more
popular, so that we have to consider

12
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.040 
is it possible to increase the efficiency
of a blockchain based solution?

13
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.300 
We will do this in this clip in
more detail and we discuss

14
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.150 
the scalability of a block
chain based solution.

15
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.010 
So how this efficiency, how this scalability
in a blockchain system can be

16
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.470 
influenced? We see the systems, the block
chain based systems become more popular

17
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.050 
and the number of people that
are using it is increasing.

18
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.760 
So and with the increasing
popularity of

19
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.680 
a blockchain based system, for
example of bitcoin system or Ethereum,

20
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.260 
more and more users are joining the
system and we see more and more

21
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.590 
transactions. So there is a larger
transaction volume created by

22
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.020 
a larger number of users. So
if we consider bitcoin

23
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.850 
what was fifty five years ago and what's
today than we see five years ago

24
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.430 
it was around two hundred
thirty thousand

25
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.050 
confirmed transactions
per day.

26
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.120 
Now, today, and that's not the
annual mean, it's only the mean

27
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.070 
of the first weeks of this year we see more
than three hundred thousand transactions

28
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.190 
per day. Similar is true for
Ethereum. In 2016

29
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.100 
there were around forty thousand
confirmed transaction per day

30
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.150 
and five years later now it is alone in
the first week more than one million

31
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.810 
two hundred thousand

32
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.460 
confirmed transaction on a day.
Here you see it on a slide

33
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.810 
this was confirmed
transactions per day

34
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.960 
for the bitcoin system compared
starting in 2010 up to

35
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.750 
today and this is a similar
for the Ethereum system

36
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.080 
which was introduced here
we see it over the last year

37
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.500 
from 2016

38
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.930 
to 2021.

39
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.820 
The question - what makes the
system slow? What is the problem

40
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.850 
with having more
users more interest

41
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.230 
and more transactions?

42
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.360 
The problem is the security. Security
measures which are essential

43
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.580 
for a decentralized and
permissionless system like

44
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.380 
blockchain system. There
is a limited block size,

45
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.960 
there is limited block time,
there is a regular interval

46
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.790 
time between new blocks being mined
and fixed by a difficult target

47
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.060 
by the difficulty of the
target in the proof of work.

48
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.520 
If one tries to make it more
efficient to restrict it

49
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.650 
then it leads to a
transaction throughput, for

50
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.900 
example a bitcoin system can currently
process up to seven transactions per second.

51
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.540 
You remember

52
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.940 
the creation of one block
needs about ten minutes. Here

53
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.540 
if we speak about the transactions
then Ethereum can make

54
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.330 
twenty transactions
per second.

55
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.450 
How system is changed when one
is lowering the block time?

56
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.420 
Block time is determined by the difficulty
of the target. The target for the

57
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.740 
proof of work, you
remember, it was

58
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.200 
with the hash values
that need to be found

59
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.610 
that the hash
value of the

60
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.760 
block description is smaller
than a certain number.

61
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.440 
When the block time,
when it is lowered

62
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.070 
then more miners would find a
solution at the same time.

63
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.350 
And then more blocks would be spread
and more work would be more

64
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.110 
change would be forked and
more work would be wasted.

65
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.340 
Then the new blocks would be
generated and added to the

66
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.700 
chain much faster than in the
currently assigned ten minutes

67
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.070 
of the bitcoin system and this
would lead to higher fork rate.

68
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.380 
And a higher number of confirmations
is required, originally

69
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.410 
a transaction is considered
confirmed after six blocks. If it's

70
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.360 
more forks then one needs more blocks
to be sure that this will become

71
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.810 
the longest chain and
higher fork rate also means that

72
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.360 
more work is wasted because more
more miners do more work and

73
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.330 
at the end only one
block of created one

74
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.940 
will be the block in the longest
chain. So it becomes more difficult

75
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.740 
to reach a consensus in the
longest chain over the network.

76
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.570 
What happens if one
raises the block size?

77
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.480 
To raise the block size would result
in having longer propagation

78
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.020 
and longer confirmation times
which in turn would lead to an

79
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.520 
increased fork rate.

80
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.770 
So for example
considering

81
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.120 
Ethereum, since the block time in Ethereum
system is only fifteen seconds

82
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.310 
the block size must be corrspondingly
smaller than a bitcoin

83
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.930 
system in order not to be compromised
as a security of a system.

84
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.700 
Other measures in
the Ethereum systems

85
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.630 
like the inclusion of orphan blocks in
the calculation of the longest chain

86
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.070 
and rewarding of the miners of these
try to help to solve this problem.

87
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.940 
So modification of block
time or block size

88
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.820 
leads to the splitting
of the system.

89
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.920 
This is another consequence
because this can be considered

90
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.100 
as a fundamental change
in the protocol.

91
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.890 
And like changing block size
or like changing block time,

92
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.170 
both needs the acceptance by all
the miners and all the users.

93
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.850 
And what we see if only a certain
number of miners and users

94
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.430 
agrees with the
change of the

95
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.940 
blockchain protocol and the
other resist in the old

96
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.180 
version, then we
see a split

97
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.870 
into two systems -

98
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.360 
those who do not accept
the proposed change

99
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:10.500 
and which do not update them,
and those which accept the new

100
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.490 
rules and change the
protocol and accept this.

101
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.030 
Neither the bitcoin developers
nor the miners can force users

102
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.370 
to accept no change that violate
existing system rules. It is

103
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.380 
an open peer-to-peer network.
There is no central

104
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.690 
instance which says now we will adapt
the system for whatever reasons

105
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.310 
into a new direction, we will
modify it some things.

106
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.020 
Users are free to decide whether they
want to accepted or not accepted.

107
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.810 
So we see a split of such an
underlying blockchain system.

108
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.480 
This means that the developers
can only hope

109
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.860 
that the new change will be accepted
by most of the miners and the users.

110
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.340 
Let's summarize. We have formalised
ourselves with the scalability challenge

111
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.090 
of the blockchain system
with the questions that arise

112
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.220 
when we think about making
blockchain system more efficient.

113
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.690 
We consider different methods

114
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.320 
to adjust system parameters, to
adjust system parameters like

115
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.470 
block size or block time
and we considered also

116
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.950 
how such changes would
effect the security of the system

117
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:43.790 
as well that we see that the
user's agreement is needed.

118
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.990 
So in the next clip, let's look
to other scalability options

119
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.210 
to go behind to only to
adjusting the parameters.

120
00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.760 
This was our first thought about
scalability by protocol changes.

1
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.800 
Now let's start with the first overview about the World Wide Web.

2
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.310 
World Wide Web or shortly the Web- that's a huge and globally distributed collection

3
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.280 
of web documents of information, of data, of services

4
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.190 
that can be accessed via the internet.

5
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.350 
One can access such sources in the world wide web by means of the

6
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
HTTP protocol- the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and

7
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.940 
it has made the internet the most important communication medium of our days.

8
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.930 
So it's a killer application of the internet.

9
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.330 
How was it possible that the web

10
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.700 
got such an importance, and this was mainly

11
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.010 
a small piece of software- the web browsers.

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.590 
The web browsers that can be easily

13
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.710 
used by means of a graphical interface, one can

14
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.390 
move a mouse, one can click and in this simple way, one can access resources

15
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.740 
in the world wide web that are placed very far away on distance server.

16
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.320 
The Web originally was introduced at CERN,

17
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.780 
the European Organization for Nuclear Research and was

18
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.430 
introduced by Robert Cailliau and Tim Berners- Lee and it was

19
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.480 
end of eighty nine early nineteen's when they

20
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.410 
came up with the first idea of the Web.

21
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.690 
The information that's contained in the Web-

22
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.510 
is hypermedia information, hypermedia document or hypertext

23
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
documents, and this notion "hyper"

24
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.040 
points to the very important tools, the linking mechanism which is

25
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.240 
the documents in the web can be interconnected to each other.

26
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.430 
So the hyperlinks are the main new thing

27
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.810 
which helps that information that placed in this server can

28
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.140 
be immediately connected to information coming from another server.

29
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.010 
So that it forms a network of information.

30
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
And users can follow those links. They can use these links to

31
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.530 
navigate from one document to reach another document and

32
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.050 
in this way to navigate in a very simple way through the giantic network

33
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.520 
of web documents. So this is the principle of the hyperlinks.

34
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.500 
There is a Document 1 and in the Document 1, there is for

35
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.190 
example a notion or a picture that browser

36
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.890 
thinks it makes sense to give more explanation about this notion, about this picture.

37
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.030 
Then he can place a link that points to another document, which

38
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.450 
typically gives more explanation and more information about what's written here.

39
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.300 
These hyperlinks can can be a lot of hyperlinks in a document

40
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.820 
and the hyperlinks may point to a document, they may point to videos,

41
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.030 
to images and other. So a document together with such hyperlinks-

42
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.440 
this is a hypermedia document.

43
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.880 
The documents themselves are placed

44
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.890 
on a web service, and this web service, they may be distributed worldwide.

45
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.120 
Important is that one can reach such web servers via

46
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.700 
an internet connection.

47
00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.990 
In order to point such a hyperlink to a new document,

48
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.520 
the other document needs an unique address.

49
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.620 
So it is important that each document in the web may be World Wide uniquely

50
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.700 
identified. And for this identification, there is a scheme-

51
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.510 
Uniform Resource Locator, which help to address

52
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.620 
documents that are placed around the world.

53
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.620 
The communication principle

54
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.360 
that gives access to the web documents is the so-called client server principle.

55
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.710 
And the client server principle

56
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.560 
works as follows- there is a client

57
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.770 
in the web, the client is the browser. The

58
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.960 
software on your smartphone, software on your laptop which allows

59
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.150 
you to access data, to access information in the

60
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.540 
World Wide Web.

61
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.740 
So as a web client, the browser, that's the active part in this

62
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.820 
communication is its client/ server communication principle:

63
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.980 
the client requests a document, a document which is placed on a server.

64
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.710 
The server is waiting for that request and when the server gets a request

65
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.670 
it delivers the document or it delivers an error message if

66
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.690 
the document is not on that place or if the user is not allowed

67
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.910 
to access the document.

68
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.500 
For the communication between the

69
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.520 
browser, the client, and the web server there is a special

70
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.440 
internet protocol necessary and this is the HTTP protocol- the Hypertext-

71
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.040 
Transfer Protocols.

72
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.850 
Modern browsers they offer not only the possibility to access web documents,

73
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.370 
but they also provide

74
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.180 
other internet services, for example FTP or email,

75
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.040 
as web applications, or streaming media and others.

76
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.450 
The mechanisms and the protocols which are necessary in order

77
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.910 
to carry out these services remain almost completely hidden from the user.

78
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.240 
Each of this Web, each of this internet services needs another internet protocol

79
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.080 
to be accessible over the internet protocol stack.

80
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.940 
So all this is behind the scenes, though for the user it's very easy

81
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.640 
to point and click and to order something or to start a service.

82
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.530 
And this is a very simple and intuitive usable user interface- it's a graphical

83
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.980 
interface as this has made the web so popular.

84
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.530 
sS in the beginning it was difficult to

85
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.410 
use such a web client. One needs an IT

86
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.430 
education, one needs to point in very

87
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.490 
special comments to request data from the Web.

88
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.950 
But then ninety- three with the first graphical user interface, it was possible

89
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.870 
to access data in the internet on a very simple way and this

90
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.840 
was the starting point that has made the Web, the killer application

91
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.520 
of the internet.

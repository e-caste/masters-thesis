1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.310 
This is knowledge graphs lecture number
five knowledge graph applications.

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.450 
Finally we will really talk
about knowledge graphs.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.500 
Let's first see where knowledge
graph really are applied.

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.020 
Where and how do you get information
nowadays? Of course you

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.150 
will find a solution on the web. For
example we have the following question-

6
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.830 
when was the greenhouse
effect discovered?

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.290 
From a lecture of course some
of you might already know but

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
what you do usually is ok you
use google and ask google when

9
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.100 
was the greenhouse
effect discovered.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.640 
And then you will see something
like that. So here for example

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.080 
google presents us the answer
eighteen ninety six. And you might

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.840 
wonder whether this is correct
because we know already about

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.080 
Joseph Fourier, and that guy
lived one century earlier.

14
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.220 
Ok why not asking
let's say another

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.760 
search engine. So here we have the same question
when was the greenhouse effect discovered

16
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.830 
and now we asked Bing.

17
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100 
So you see here it presents
us an answer where exactly

18
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.580 
the answer is highlighted in
that article and here we have

19
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.770 
Joseph Fourier in eighteen twenty
seven and John Tyndall in

20
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.340 
eighteen sixty one. So
this looks more like

21
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.750 
how we already know it. So that's
really really interesting but

22
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.710 
let's see this was question answering.
Let us somehow rephrase our information

23
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.540 
need or refine it a bit. So of
course we want to know before

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.570 
we want to know when it was discovered
what is it what's the greenhouse effect?

25
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.500 
We ask again what's the
greenhouse effect and then

26
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.010 
search engines like for example
bing give you the answer.

27
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.890 
They present you here for example
in a small infobox the wikipedia

28
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.030 
definition of the greenhouse effect.
They present you with related

29
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.230 
people to the greenhouse effect
and there again we have Joseph

30
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.980 
Fourier and also we have John Tyndall
that we have heard about already

31
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
and you see similar things what
people also were looking for

32
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.140 
while searching for the
greenhouse effect.

33
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.440 
So this is only in the infobox on
the right side in the middle

34
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.240 
you see then also the typical
standard answers of search engine

35
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.060 
which means documents that of course
are dealing with the greenhouse

36
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.940 
effect. Like this one, what is the
greenhouse effect? Of course

37
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.370 
this was our question and the
interesting thing is ok

38
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.200 
there is a document with exactly
that kind of title and potentially

39
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.120 
it might of course contain the answer
to our question. So this is the basic

40
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.270 
paradigm here of
information retrieval.

41
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.150 
If we look closer at that of
course this is the traditional

42
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.380 
answer, so answers that come directly
from the search engine index

43
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.020 
and over there what we have there's
so these kind of definitions

44
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.480 
and also these relations to related
people of that stuff. This

45
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.530 
comes from a
knowledge graph.

46
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.160 
So information retrieval or in
particular search engines are

47
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.970 
the first and the most prominent applications
that make use of knowledge graphs.

48
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.340 
While for the traditional indexes
usually they show us web

49
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.200 
pages, news articles and tweets. What
they can do with the knowledge

50
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.360 
graph is they can present to us facts.
Facts in the form of structured data

51
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.330 
and this of course is rather
easily to be used and applied

52
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.710 
for question answering. So if you ask google
when was the greenhouse effect discovered

53
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.980 
and if exactly this state like
for example discovery date of

54
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.060 
greenhouse effect somehow is
represented in the knowledge graph

55
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.110 
you will get your answer unambiguously,
uniquely and if you're lucky of course

56
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.830 
correctly. Yeah so knowledge graphs
really are important and you can see

57
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.210 
this also on the so called
Gartner Hype Cycle graph. You

58
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.270 
know the Gartner Hype Cycle, so this
is an interesting curve which

59
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.510 
starts with an innovation trigger
which means new and emerging

60
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.390 
technologies become rather popular
and then they come to the

61
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.600 
peak of the so called inflated
expectations before again they

62
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.240 
drop down deep in the value of
disillusionment. And then they have to climb

63
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.810 
rather carefully the slope of
enlightenment before they reach

64
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.350 
at one point the plateau of
productivity again. And if you look

65
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.350 
at knowledge graphs they are really
on the rise. So in two thousand

66
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.640 
and nineteen by the end of two thousand nineteen
this Gartner Hype Cycle was published,

67
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.430 
knowledge graphs were already
here in the upper half of the

68
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.920 
innovation trigger which means
this is an important technology.

69
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.000 
Since when are knowledge graphs
really important? Everything

70
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.390 
started I guess with the
google knowledge graph.

71
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.100 
Of course knowledge graphs were
around way before google the

72
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.680 
only thing is we didn't we
didn't name it that way.

73
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.390 
We simply said this is a knowledge
base because a knowledge

74
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.030 
graph is nothing else but a
knowledge base sometimes only in

75
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.520 
a rather shallow variant but
however since you are able to

76
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.060 
represent the knowledge in a knowledge
base also in a graph structure

77
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.880 
this is a knowledge graph. But
google introduced the knowledge

78
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.150 
graph already in two thousand
and twelve and ever since then

79
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
google is able to for example
produce also this kind of info

80
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.940 
boxes that you see as soon as a
google query is parsed and there

81
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.960 
some entity which is somehow
represented in the knowledge

82
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.360 
graph will be detected. And then
you see immediately information

83
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.620 
about that entity and also other
facts and questions that could be

84
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.750 
interesting to the user to be
answered. So therefore google

85
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.870 
knowledge graph rather important for search
and improves tremendously the quality

86
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.210 
of search. Also if you
ask google themselves

87
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.130 
is this really somehow important so here
I tried to ask for knowledge graphs

88
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.100 
in the google news section and I looked
in the news articles and google here

89
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.380 
was referencing almost eighty thousand
articles on knowledge graphs which is

90
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.180 
really a lot and you see also by the
time when I did this kind of uh

91
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.710 
cleary then the top coverage
here was the acquisition of a

92
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.970 
company called Capsenta by
data.world Capsenta was one of the

93
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.410 
great knowledge graph or semantic
technologies companies that was then

94
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.010 
later on your board
by data.world

95
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.920 
Ok so you see knowledge graphs are
important under all aspects. Even here

96
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.200 
the enterprise knowledge graph
or enterprise knowledge graphs

97
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.510 
are rather
prominent because

98
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.210 
many companies nowadays many
enterprises are trying for example to

99
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:52.180 
integrate and combine their internal
information systems and databases based

100
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.380 
on the knowledge graph. They use knowledge
graphs for data integration because

101
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.330 
this is rather easy. This follows
the fair principles, implements

102
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.530 
them and mixed and subsequent
integration and federated usage

103
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.890 
of all of these information source
is quite easy. So knowledge graphs

104
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.840 
already have reached
also industry.

105
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.010 
Now it's time to do a proper
definition of that term.

106
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.110 
However we know already what it
is but let's give a proper

107
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.910 
definition of knowledge graphs.
So first of all the knowledge

108
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:30.200 
graph is a graph and it consists out of concept,
classes, properties, relationships and entity

109
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.740 
descriptions. Usually it's based on
a formal knowledge representation

110
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:41.350 
so in our case it's RDF(S) and OWL, so these
are the W3C standard representation format.

111
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.410 
The data itself in a knowledge
graph can be open like you know

112
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.310 
it already from DBpedia or WikiData,
it can be completely private like

113
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.000 
supply chain data or it can also
be closed like if you look at

114
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.990 
product models. The data can be
original, it can be derived from

115
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.110 
somewhere, it can be aggregated data
and in general we distinguish

116
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.340 
within a knowledge graph so called
incidence data. This is our

117
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.300 
ground truth because
we think this is ok.

118
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.400 
Then we have schema data, these are
the vocabulary and the ontologies

119
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.830 
that are connected with it. Then
we have metadata about the

120
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.400 
data represented there. So this
means data about the provenance,

121
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.880 
about versioning, about licensing
rights issues and all the

122
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.270 
stuff so this
is metadata.

123
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:32.620 
And then usually we have taxonomies
that somehow categorize and organize

124
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.560 
the entities we have there. And
in between that of course there

125
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.830 
are links between these entities and
there are also links to external data

126
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.270 
and this includes of course also
mapping to data which is stored

127
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.890 
in other systems and
other databases.

128
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.750 
And of course this data as I already
said is fully compliant to

129
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.580 
fair data principles. This means fair data
principles you have heard about them.

130
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.660 
Make your data findable, make it
accessible, make it interoperable,

131
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:08.180 
and make it reproducible. So these
four points are fully compliant if

132
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.840 
you are using a knowledge graph.
So knowledge graph is really

133
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.340 
a good technology to
enable fair data.

134
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.880 
So let's continue.

135
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.320 
A knowledge graph is a data set in general
so that can be first structured.

136
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.850 
So it's structured in the form
of a specific data structure.

137
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.600 
When you see that it's normalized
usually it consists of small

138
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.170 
units such as vertices and edges and
it's connected usually defined by

139
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.890 
connections between objects and of
course they might be possibly

140
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.740 
also distant connections, so not
necessarily a direct connection.

141
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.830 
Typically knowledge
graphs are explicit.

142
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.940 
This means they are created purposefully
with a specific intended meaning.

143
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.520 
Then they are declarative. What does
that mean? They are meaningful

144
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.440 
in itself, so independent of a particular
implementation or a particular algorithm.

145
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.880 
They are heavily annotated which means they
are enriched with contextual information

146
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.380 
to record additional details
especially in the field of metadata.

147
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.210 
They are non-hierarchical usually
which means they are more

148
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.290 
than just a plain tree structure
or just a plain hierarchy

149
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.210 
and this knowledge graph that
we are talking about they are

150
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.250 
huge so we are talking about
millions of nodes than rather of

151
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.190 
hundreds of elements.

152
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.730 
The most prominent knowledge
graph that you all know is the

153
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:41.190 
entire web of data, the inter-connected
net of linked open data

154
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.070 
so we already have talked about
that. There are lots of data

155
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.070 
sets and all of these datasets
themselves they are small knowledge

156
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.850 
graphs or sometimes also big knowledge
graphs. So they form already

157
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.230 
a huge web of data that you can
access and that can be used

158
00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.260 
for organizational issues or for
information retrieval issues and so on.

159
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.560 
Here in the last slide you see
again an example how in principle

160
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.880 
in information retrieval it really works
that you connect your knowledge graph

161
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.350 
with the documents that you have
then in your search annexed

162
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.270 
and usually these documents in
your search annexed of course

163
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.180 
they have to be analyzed entities
this means instances, classes etc

164
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.660 
entities have to be detected and
linked to knowledge graph entities.

165
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.260 
So entities from the document to
the knowledge graph and since

166
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.580 
you have been there in the knowledge
graph the two layers you

167
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.770 
have first the entity level where
you know one entity is connected

168
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.880 
via specific properties to another
entity and lots of other

169
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.090 
kinds of data is therefore the specific
entities. Then you have also

170
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.220 
the terminological knowledge, the
ontology behind the knowledge

171
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.380 
graph. So you have the information about
the classes, how the classes somehow are

172
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.770 
related to each other the kind
of restrictions that hold and

173
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.250 
so on and so on and the point is
exactly by these kind of connections

174
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.410 
that you see here you are able
simply to follow connections

175
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.430 
either from your terminological
level or from your instance

176
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.920 
level and make use of these
connections while determining the

177
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.900 
answer to your information needs. So
you make a query that usually only

178
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.790 
works on the document in the
information retrieval system in

179
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.490 
the search engine. However since
you know the connection of

180
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.560 
the entities to the documents you
can draw connections between

181
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.140 
documents that are not necessarily
are actually via the terms

182
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.710 
that you are looking for connected
and by doing that you can enrich

183
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.200 
your usual search result or you
can let say make you a search

184
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.690 
result more precise. These are
the two things and we will go

185
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.950 
deeper into these two topics when we talk
about later on knowledge graphs applied

186
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:58.910 
for semantic search. Ok but now
let's first look at RDF and

187
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.260 
OWL knowledge graphs.

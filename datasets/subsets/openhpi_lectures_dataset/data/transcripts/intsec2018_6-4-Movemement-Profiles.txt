1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.432 
Now, let's take a closer look at Movement Profiles.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.152 
Movement profiles aggregate user data.

3
00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:12.259 
When and what was done

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.619 
and where did that take place, all this data

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.949 
can be collected if the user has a smartphone,

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.200 
it goes to the Internet, has other electronic devices, then

7
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.640 
all these devices make it possible.

8
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.049 
All these devices collect data.

9
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.820 
And from this data, it's possible to see what a user

10
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.130 
did and get when one can get a very deep insight into

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.140 
the life of a person.

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.780 
So it's a typically understanding of the move and profiles

13
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.860 
relates to location based profiles.

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.639 
Where or when and how long, where users in one place,

15
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.569 
what was the next place, how they moved from one place to another

16
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.939 
as a movement, profiles are application profiles.

17
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.829 
So it's not only interesting to see on which location to use

18
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.329 
it, it's also very interesting to see what kind of application a

19
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.680 
user is using. How does a user moves around

20
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.180 
within an application, for example, in an Internet browser

21
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.829 
or an email client?

22
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.300 
How a user moves service in the Internet?

23
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.715 
What is he looking? Which kind of well is he selecting?

24
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.900 
What's interesting for him on that website, what's not interesting,

25
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.560 
which page is he or she is listening?

26
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.690 
When and how long is the pages are resisted?

27
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.790 
Such data collection does not always have to be anonymous.

28
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.799 
The name of a person can also be assigned because for some

29
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.250 
services one needs to know the user.

30
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.759 
So it is not difficult to connect.

31
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.099 
We speak of aggregate such data to learn more

32
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.659 
about the person, about the activities of a person, about

33
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.800 
a person's life.

34
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.039 
The profiles can be created by different devices,

35
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.616 
for example, by mobile phones, but also RFID

36
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.050 
chips help to collect data smartcards, cameras

37
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.780 
constructing a Wi-Fi networks.

38
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.669 
Because in a Wi-Fi network, Wences, who is associated to an

39
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.904 
access point. Browsers, of course, are a source to get information

40
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.828 
about the activities of our users or third

41
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.370 
party websites that I visited.

42
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.164 
And many more applications, devices,

43
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.766 
tools connect data about

44
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.580 
a person that can be aggregated.

45
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.580 
Why is such profiles are of interest for companies

46
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.889 
and for for agencies, for example, surveillance

47
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.810 
questions or personalised advertisement analysers?

48
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.729 
This is based on receiving such data to

49
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.629 
immediately start a kind of activity.

50
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.429 
Let's have a closer look to mobile phone tracking with GSM

51
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.719 
when you start with your mobile.

52
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.320 
And after power on the mobile phone, always

53
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.375 
connect with a mobile phone side, typically with a cell

54
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.709 
tower that's the closest in your neighbourhood.

55
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.450 
This is necessary so that the communication

56
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.210 
company is able to see you when you are calling

57
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.949 
and to to organise a connexion to the one you

58
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:16.970 
want to call with.

59
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.639 
So the network operator, they store the idea of the

60
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.589 
mobile side and the time at which a mobile phone was connected.

61
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.549 
So this is necessary. Otherwise they cannot provide the service.

62
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.370 
Then the mobile side has a certain range.

63
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.500 
It's radio data.

64
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.420 
So typically a few hundred metres in a city or

65
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.840 
up to 35 kilometres in countryside.

66
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.879 
This is the neighbourhood one can move

67
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.529 
with having a connexion to the to a cell tower.

68
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.550 
It makes it possible to determine the parameter in

69
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.639 
which the mobile phones are located.

70
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.339 
What is not possible? It's not possible to find out the direction from

71
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.162 
the science point of view. So if this is a circle, then it's not clear whether

72
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.990 
the user is here or here, but what is known that the user is

73
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.339 
in that environment of society.

74
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
So there's a transmission range from cell science may overlap.

75
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.140 
So this helps to get more information.

76
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.160 
For example, here in this example, we have two overlapping, even three overlapping

77
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.629 
areas from such from such

78
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.709 
sites. And then it's clear if.

79
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.397 
A mobile phone user can connect to this side, to this

80
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.679 
side and to set aside, then he is necessary, then

81
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.770 
man knows exactly that he is within that area.

82
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.830 
So this area is much smaller than the circle around one of

83
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.743 
the sites. So as the position can then be determined more

84
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.529 
precisely here, one speaks from three triangulation.

85
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.160 
Meanwhile, that mobile phone tracking is

86
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.139 
being offered as a service.

87
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.209 
So you can you can download apps which

88
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.807 
help you to find the location of an owner of a mobile

89
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.215 
phone in Germany, for example, to speak about

90
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.710 
regulation. New data retention law passed

91
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.232 
in 2015 tells that connexion data must

92
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.820 
be stored for 10 weeks.

93
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.459 
It must be stored. Who was called and the dates, the times,

94
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.529 
the duration of the call literally stored.

95
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.049 
The location data must be stored for four weeks

96
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.959 
and as currently suspended due to

97
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.269 
lawsuits. So is a question.

98
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.470 
Is this our request from the authorities

99
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.967 
which have to guarantee security so as they

100
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.349 
want to have the possibility to

101
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.499 
investigate criminal activities by means of such data.

102
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.240 
But of course, the data are stored and are collected

103
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.480 
without knowing whether this is a criminal or not.

104
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.630 
When this connexion data and publicity available data

105
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.649 
from the Internet, for example, such as metadata or blocks,

106
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.069 
then if this data can be brought together, a very accurate

107
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.920 
movement profile of a person can be created.

108
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.029 
So knowing where is the mobile phone of

109
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.150 
a user, typically then the user has a with

110
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.329 
a with him or her and taking other information, then

111
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:20.160 
one is able to reconstruct a over the time

112
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.319 
where how a person is moving.

113
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.819 
And exactly this hour, as this movement profiles,

114
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.190 
for example, data that were published on Green Party politician

115
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.529 
spits in Germany shows how this could look like.

116
00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.049 
So on his website, he showed this.

117
00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.999 
And here he is living and bringing together information

118
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.859 
from Twitter, Twitter activity, from the incoming calls, from

119
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.457 
the outgoing calls, one can't exactly say and see and

120
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.039 
reconstruct said on first September nine,

121
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.229 
nine o'clock and one minute twenty nine seconds.

122
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.330 
This person, this Multa Smit's was in that

123
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.299 
area only from trackings.

124
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:19.080 
A mobile phone with GSM GPS

125
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.450 
is another possibility to get location data

126
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.409 
as well as closeness.

127
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.473 
Baidu and Galileo, the receiver here,

128
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.110 
for example, a mobile phone receives position data from satellites

129
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.750 
and can calculate its own position.

130
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.370 
You know this from a car navigation system.

131
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.928 
Our car needs this data to find out where is the car

132
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.759 
now and what is the goal.

133
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.809 
The car went to reach and to compute the best connexion.

134
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.449 
So there are satellites and these are the different different

135
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.450 
systems, which when a person gets contact by this

136
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.989 
GPS system to several satellites, then

137
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.910 
from the positions of the satellites, when can they exactly compute the position

138
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.850 
of that person?

139
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.809 
Application system navigation systems need this, but also

140
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.554 
other location based information and need such GPS data.

141
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.830 
For example, if you want to use a service in your smartphone,

142
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.669 
which shows you the next Italian restaurant or others, the

143
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:41.100 
first, the location needs to be fired out, then to compute,

144
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.079 
which is the closest restaurant, and then check in the database, whether it's an Italian

145
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.989 
one. So for precise position.

146
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.229 
Determination, the receiver must have contact with at least

147
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:59.389 
four satellites, the location within

148
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.124 
his GPS is much more precise than the position

149
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.844 
as the location data one can get from the GSM system, from the GSM

150
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.909 
system. One has to see whether there's an overlap of the different

151
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:18.889 
sides. But here with the GPS system, which has a connexion,

152
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.080 
a system with GPS that has connexions to more to at least four satellites,

153
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.419 
one can exactly precise compute where the

154
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.549 
person, the car or whatever is located.

155
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.870 
The communication inside itself is anonymous.

156
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.889 
So here is the computing of the position.

157
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.720 
This is completely independent of the name

158
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.059 
of a person or the idea.

159
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.099 
So it is anonymous, but nevertheless, the apps can

160
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.049 
collect GPS data and then send this data to the applications,

161
00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.075 
for example, to the to the application, said recommends

162
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.070 
the restaurant. So the need the data to

163
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.499 
be able to answer a question and then the recommendation for the next restaurant.

164
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.135 
But then the application provider has all this data, although the

165
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:22.249 
data of the person as a movement, data of the person chips information.

166
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.690 
And it's not clear what the provider is doing with that data.

167
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.899 
So, for example, it was under IT systems.

168
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.739 
You can view stored GPS data in the Google account.

169
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.602 
Here is the website. You can find out as the data location

170
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.909 
data of a person.

171
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.629 
This was what is possible by smart phones

172
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.830 
and devices over the G is M or

173
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.687 
C just P, let's let's have a look

174
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.813 
to another collect of data to another device to

175
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.638 
RFID chips, RFID radio frequency

176
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.280 
identification.

177
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.919 
It's an technology for transceiver

178
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.820 
systems, very small of those RFID transponder

179
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.010 
can be you of the size of a rice grain

180
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.070 
and is able, for example, in the U.S.

181
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.219 
or in other devices to collect data.

182
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.549 
The RFID chip have a permanent memory

183
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.232 
which contains the identity, also application of

184
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.880 
user data. It's possible, though, that the RFID

185
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:51.620 
ship chip reader can

186
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.440 
exactly see and get this information from the transponder.

187
00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.409 
So is the transponders are red wire

188
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.519 
radio waves.

189
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:07.729 
So if such a transponder comes close to an RFID

190
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.589 
reader, so the RFID did outside the reader can

191
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:17.269 
receive data, can zent data, can also

192
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.669 
is an energy and then the reader can give

193
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.809 
in the data to any kind of application or to any kind

194
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.840 
of database.

195
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:34.009 
So the transponder itself needs an antenna for that radio

196
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.419 
wave communication.

197
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.759 
So the use of such RFID tags is RFID chips.

198
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.960 
Responder's and systems is to tag objects,

199
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.198 
for example, to track patients in a in a hospital so

200
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.240 
that the system knows.

201
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.309 
Is he in that clinic or is he or with this investigation, when can

202
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.809 
use such RFID systems for

203
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.470 
protection against theft of devices?

204
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.679 
When can users for kind of ID?

205
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.149 
Because then if someone comes close to

206
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.590 
such a reader, the reader can see and can find out who is it

207
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.629 
and is this allowed to access

208
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.360 
that service or these data?

209
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.330 
Also, such RFID chips can be used to

210
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.249 
receive motion profiles they can use to

211
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.350 
identify and track objects.

212
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.299 
By the way, this is where they were discovered and developed for for example,

213
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.419 
they can identify and track packages

214
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.130 
and analysis.

215
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.838 
RFID chips in smartcards or inclosing can be used to

216
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.679 
create motion profiles.

217
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.629 
They need this data. They need to collect this data to provide the service

218
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.698 
they are designed for. But then this data are in the world and

219
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.389 
then this data could be used also for other purposes

220
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.299 
sometimes that people are not aware of this.

221
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.211 
Sometimes the people know from the hospital, the patient is

222
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.662 
explained that this receiver helps to find and to organise

223
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.641 
transport and other things. But sometimes the people do not know that

224
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.809 
in there we're such receivers are installed

225
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.909 
with the receivers, with this RFID.

226
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.329 
It's possible also to get movement data

227
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.659 
inside buildings, inside buildings.

228
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.549 
GPS is not working. So here with the RFID

229
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.919 
chips and the responders, also a movement inside a building

230
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.180 
can be recognised.

231
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.039 
For that reason, the antennas need to be installed in every room

232
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.989 
and sometimes there are some problems with overlapping signals.

233
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.549 
But in principle, it's possible.

234
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.778 
Such contactless smart cards are also RFID

235
00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.749 
chips outside these chips, which usually also have a

236
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.099 
processor here. That's an example of a German ID card

237
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.770 
system. Smart cards have checkout format

238
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.047 
they use as they are used as I.D.

239
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.680 
cards. They are used for access control.

240
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.809 
They are used as cash cards, tickets, credit

241
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.630 
cards and others. So tickets.

242
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:50.280 
For example, in the form of such smartcards can generate motion provides

243
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.090 
like storing the entry or exit stations.

244
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.768 
Here are some example.

245
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.619 
For example, a smart card for the usage of public transportation

246
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.598 
to perform a service that by means of such a card as

247
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.990 
the user can step into into

248
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.839 
such a bus or a tram.

249
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.480 
The control is by the checking the RFID

250
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:26.339 
communication, which says, yes, this person is indemnified, has paid the service.

251
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.619 
But of course this data is an are in the world and can also be used

252
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.070 
for creating emotional profiles and other sorts of

253
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.581 
data to create motion which provides surveillance

254
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.959 
cameras. Surveillance cameras are used to increase security

255
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:51.240 
in public places, in railway stations, in airports,

256
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.970 
buildings and others.

257
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.829 
And this is helpful because then it's

258
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.749 
more easy, for example, to find criminals or to detect if there are problems.

259
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:09.180 
But with the appropriate software, people can be differentiated

260
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.220 
by their faces, by their body shapes, by their closeness to others.

261
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.599 
So one can use and investigate this

262
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.700 
videos, which are recorded, for example, to find out whether

263
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.387 
there was a person in a certain point of time in this

264
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.819 
location. So it can be determined when and where

265
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.025 
a person was kept under cameras and then this

266
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.630 
data can be linked to the data.

267
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.329 
Then the data can be linked to other data

268
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.009 
from other cameras. So one cannot only see the movement

269
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.459 
inside the viewing field of a camera.

270
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.319 
One can connect this also with other cameras

271
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.721 
viewing film and then get an informative movement

272
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.470 
profile. For example, in China, the CCTV

273
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.010 
surveillance networks includes one hundred seventy

274
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.279 
million cameras.

275
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.829 
So it took us ten to seven minutes to

276
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.280 
locate and catch a BBC reporter after he was added

277
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.949 
to the suspect's database by connecting all the

278
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:33.240 
data of this huge amount of surveillance

279
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.089 
cameras by the connecting them and applying software which can

280
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.950 
identify persons automatically in identifying persons on

281
00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.170 
that images.

282
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.950 
Last but not least to mention, Motian profiles on the Internet.

283
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.685 
Although the storage of websites visited how many, when

284
00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.930 
and how often, how long and so on gives a lot of data,

285
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.809 
which tells a lot about a person.

286
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.299 
The data differs for most people.

287
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.800 
So one can use this data to identify a person.

288
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.270 
So Internet usage profiles?

289
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.190 
No, it's no motion in the physical world.

290
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.660 
It is motion in the virtual world.

291
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.619 
So Internet usage profiles can be received,

292
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.059 
for example, from the history activity file of a

293
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.859 
browser. Here you see the chronic of browser

294
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:42.150 
and then you see exactly which website was

295
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.869 
visited at which time by a user.

296
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.339 
So a third party providers can also create such as such

297
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.900 
profiles. They can do this through their own content on

298
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.579 
different websites, for example, social networks, Facebook

299
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.930 
like buttons which are on many, many websites, and not only on

300
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.699 
Facebook websites by means of this link, but it's

301
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.690 
possible also for Facebook to see when

302
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:21.150 
a user visited this page sharing on Twitter a similar

303
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.499 
advertisement. Bana's This is the idea of such advertisement.

304
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.170 
Better of the same service on different pages helps

305
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.950 
for the for the advertising company to collect the

306
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.140 
data soliciting data for user usage data

307
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.559 
also from websites that are not the only one.

308
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.400 
So this is also possible by means of third party JavaScript files

309
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.259 
on different pages.

310
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.150 
If you want to protect against such things

311
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.349 
as they are available browser plug ins like

312
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.649 
let's take Firefox Web browser as an example, like no script

313
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.209 
or Google, Google, Facebook, Twitter, disconnect,

314
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:17.220 
Adblock Plus, which can block such tracking code

315
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.599 
and other unwanted content.

316
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.890 
So if you are not agree with such kind of that, third

317
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.710 
parties find out how you move in the Internet.

318
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:33.690 
They are possibilities which in this case, in this example,

319
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.819 
describe for Firefox, which blocks such tracking

320
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.119 
code and other unwanted contexts.

321
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:48.950 
But many modern websites do not work without JavaScript.

322
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.130 
If you switch off the JavaScript and many of the functionality

323
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.080 
of website is no more available.

324
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:03.150 
It depends from the model and it depends from the configuration

325
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.748 
in which Web browsers send data to central

326
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.329 
services central servers that allowing tracking.

327
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.890 
For example, in the case of Google Chrome, here

328
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.417 
is there is one settings for Google Chrome.

329
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.352 
It's possible to make decisions, for example, user service

330
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.599 
to help preserve navigation errors, user prediction service to help complete

331
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.780 
search and you URLs type insur.

332
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.529 
SO as there are many possibilities, you are

333
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:42.300 
asked to decide whether you allow Google to access the data

334
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.769 
or whether you are not allowing Google to access this data

335
00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.989 
here in this example of Google Chrome, then Web services

336
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.950 
and navigation and form data with a data

337
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.724 
of the currently accessed page for correction of navigation errors, spelling

338
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.930 
check or completion.

339
00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.767 
So here, this is a request to you that they

340
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.169 
want to get the data in order to increase

341
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.729 
and improve the service.

342
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.400 
Prefectures of resources functions also sent partially

343
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.779 
entered URLs to serve observers.

344
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.469 
So is that the people there could see what you are

345
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.569 
interested in, what the users are interested in?

346
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.701 
The manufacturers have, of course, the legitimate interest in getting

347
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.924 
usage statistics. So you want to know in which way users

348
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.729 
use their services, use their website, use their resources

349
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.995 
in order. Who improves their business in order to focus

350
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.669 
on particular useful effect, but which

351
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.990 
information are sent to whom, this remains often

352
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:04.299 
not transparent and this is a problem, and here is the user's

353
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.040 
need to be more careful with their data.

354
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.910 
So the data usage data, they have a value.

355
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.570 
They have an important value for the manufacturers.

356
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.559 
So the user should insist on finding out in which way

357
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.140 
manufacturers can access data and under what conditions,

358
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.999 
but cautioned, if enabled, do not track

359
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.140 
settings is sent as a request

360
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.841 
to site operators. But it's not a legally binding

361
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.119 
obligation for them.

362
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.619 
This is all with outsourcing. So it's a wish.

363
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.809 
But there are no possibility and no force

364
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:54.760 
to guarantee that even if you have desired that

365
00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.801 
your activities are not tracked, then that these activities

366
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.410 
are tracked.

367
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.040 
Let's draw some conclusions about motion profiles,

368
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.079 
digital technologies and innovation.

369
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:14.020 
Innovative features enrich our everyday life with many

370
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.749 
amenities so people are happy.

371
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:21.070 
People are using. These services are very popular, which

372
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.180 
can be provided by means of this digital technology.

373
00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:30.609 
But the downside is we leave data, we leave data

374
00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:35.289 
that can be tracked. We leave very sensitive personal information,

375
00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:39.460 
for example, our health data that can be stored externally.

376
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.170 
And it's not for us as a user.

377
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.810 
It's not clear where our very sensible

378
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:51.849 
health state, our private health data or emotion data are stored

379
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.257 
externally. And under which conditions, if you do not

380
00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.081 
want to live without new digital technologies, then you can

381
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.699 
hardly avoid data raises.

382
00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.140 
You can hardly avoid emotional profiles, but

383
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.749 
it is possible to limit the collection of personal

384
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.543 
data. How you can do this, for example, only activate the

385
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.425 
GPS location service on smartphones when this

386
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.459 
information is needed, or when you want to use an application that

387
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:32.079 
needs that GPS position only turn

388
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.320 
on Internet on smart phone when necessary.

389
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.250 
This helps to restrict the collection of personal data.

390
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:46.180 
NASAA idea or another possibility is to block third party cookies

391
00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:51.310 
in browser settings or prohibit JavaScript by third parties

392
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.452 
with spouse applicants. So you can you can make selections

393
00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.149 
in most recent browsers to improve privacy, but

394
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:05.619 
often you has to pay with less

395
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.509 
in with that, the service couldn't, not more

396
00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:15.340 
provided in the full context. For example, if you switch off JavaScript,

397
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.480 
it helps to make tracking

398
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:24.729 
your activities more difficult, but it also decreases the

399
00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.140 
functionality of the website.

400
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.970 
Most important is one should think about that, one should make

401
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.880 
informed decisions, what kind of data collection

402
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.670 
you will allow and what not.

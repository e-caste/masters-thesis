1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.450 
Now I would like to ask three gentlemen to come forward.

2
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.640 
Matthias Renner, Johannes Rudolf, Robin Lamberti

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.350 
Because we want to do a little activity like this, which is our openHPI platform.

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.949 
You know the one where we try to combine this e-learning with social interaction with the Massive Open Online courses.

5
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:39.259 
and in the promotion of the clean-IT activities we said yes, when we have such an instrument, then we will

6
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:45.140 
make different forums, different offers and

7
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.250 
,there is a channel let's call it, a channel set up where all the clean-IT formats are collected.

8
00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.020 
Now this is not as systematic as the courses at openHPI where a course lasts over 14 days or six weeks, but

9
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
there are also individual activities.

10
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.620 
There is also the invitation to them if you want to share best practices there,

11
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.129 
it's a very straightforward format,

12
00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:11.209 
let us know.

13
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:18.849 
But with all these uncomplicated things, of course, you need a little bit of systematic knowledge and so I'm happy to

14
00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:29.629 
that the three of you here have designed and built a new openHPI MOOC, Sustainable Software Engineering, and

15
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.750 
that we are going to release it together right now.

16
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.819 
What was the thought and their drive behind doing this,

17
00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:48.549 
gladly, if the others also - test, test well.

18
00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.329 
A brief word on the history of the development?

19
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.650 
We had, Johannes and I, we had with Bitkom, which was here earlier today,

20
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:07.950 
published a paper, a guideline on how to combine digitalisation and sustainability, and then

21
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.680 
HPI said "there is more music in this", they approached us and said let's make more out of it, and then

22
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
we thought about it a bit, because it is a task that is of course connected with a certain challenge, but it is a challenge that we have to take on.

23
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.650 
it is also a personal concern for us and that's why we said "let's do it" and that's how the course came about.

24
00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:37.669 
It is for everyone who is interested in the subject, so even if only those who can finish the course completely, the basics are still welcome.

25
00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:44.349 
in Python, anyone who is interested can still follow the first half of the course and all the

26
00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.449 
Learn basics you need to know to understand digitisation in a sustainable context.

27
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.030 
This was also my personal contribution to explain the basics, so in the beginning I explain like what is hiding

28
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.409 
behind CO2 equivalents.

29
00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:10.000 
We need to somehow understand watts and be able to calculate something with energy so that we end up thinking about the solutions

30
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.430 
and when we think about the solutions we offer in the course, a toolbox of things that you can do.

31
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.150 
to make software engineering sustainable.

32
00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:30.960 
That was a long journey over seven months, and I was not alone because of that and I am glad that still

33
00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.000 
Johannes was there and also supported me.

34
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.750 
What did you do?

35
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:45.560 
Exactly, I gave the course a contribution to the practical perspective that I also have in my professional practice.

36
00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:53.539 
accompanying many large companies into the cloud on their cloud journeys on a daily basis. And we were

37
00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:54.159 
about

38
00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.789 
Engineering Practices so we called that Sustainable Software Engineering, and not - we had discussed that.

39
00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:05.919 
at the beginning - Sustainable Programming, because it was important for us not to focus only on the software developers.

40
00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.979 
but on the reality of life in which they do engineering.

41
00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:17.079 
And today we have DevOps teams, that means we don't only have software engineers, we also have automation specialists.

42
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.670 
in the teams,

43
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.899 
we have product managers, we try to develop in an agile way.

44
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.569 
We have customers who make completely different demands on us, on IT than they did ten years ago, and in this reality of life

45
00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:34.850 
we want to give teams tools and ingenious methods,

46
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
to design and live software sustainably.

47
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.529 
And that's what the first week of the course is.

48
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.379 
Matthias and I did this together, and it was also very important to us when it came to the implementation.

49
00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:56.250 
that is, really solid coding, solid practices, to have a correspondingly interactive part there.

50
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.279 
And this was done by Ferdinand, who unfortunately is not with us today, and Robin, and Robin will be happy to say a few words about this.

51
00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.339 
to say.

52
00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:12.050 
Exactly, and that was a concern for both of us in particular, this holistic view that we simply want to offer in the course.

53
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.750 
and then also to extend it to programming, and that's where we want to start to provide the means to do this.

54
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.209 
how to do it in the first place,

55
00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:27.949 
We have already talked today about the fact that it is difficult to actually measure energy consumption of software systems.

56
00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:28.350 
can.

57
00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
It's not always that easy to find out, but there is research on this, and there are methods that in principle also

58
00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:42.709 
and that forms the quantitative basis of the second week.

59
00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:49.800 
And then we go into what all the design decisions are that you make when you're developing software.

60
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.949 
that are conducive to the sustainability of the software product in the end.

61
00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:04.180 
So, that's about decisions, do you move workloads to the cloud or maybe to the edge and what kind of

62
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:12.019 
software architectures do you use, which ones are better not to use in the different situations and we deal with that.

63
00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:19.149 
even at the lowest level with data structures and complexity, different operations that really depend again on the

64
00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:30.579 
theoretical point of view, but not only from the point of view of "yes, the software".

65
00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:38.639 
must be bug-free, it must run, it must be as fast as possible", but it must also be energy-efficient and that is where

66
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:55.029 
we want to create awareness, that's exactly where we want to create awareness. Do you want

67
00:06:55.029 --> 00:07:02.430 
say a few words about your professional background today, because this Clean IT Forum is open to everybody.

68
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:09.399 
We are beginners as HPI, we have different things but we all have to stand together and stick together and do the same thing.

69
00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.649 
to gather as much knowledge as possible.

70
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.730 
That is also one of the advantages, because we come from professional practice and that is why we tried to use our knowledge in the course.

71
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.709 
experience in projects.

72
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:33.240 
I am myself, I would say mainly IT architect, I am with clients and advise them how to build software

73
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.779 
at the beginning of a project, and then writing the specification, which the development teams then also write the software

74
00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:47.899 
product and there are a lot of things that you can take into account, which we also discuss in the course, that we maybe

75
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:54.569 
APIs on a regular basis but use event patterns, just as one of many examples and from

76
00:07:54.569 --> 00:08:00.410 
monoliths maybe to distributed systems, but we always have to look at that depending on the situation, and there are quite

77
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:08.980 
many topics, but I have the IT perspective in my background, so to speak, and Johannes, where are you coming from? Maybe very briefly

78
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.089 
How did Bitkom find you?

79
00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:14.240 
Did they say "why don't you do a study"?

80
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.990 
In fact, I think it was just a call to say We have an idea here.

81
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.050 
That also came out of the working group.

82
00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:26.100 
And there were just motivated people who cared about this issue.

83
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.819 
And then Bitkom is also such an open platform.

84
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:35.220 
And then Bitkom said that this also suits us quite well, and if there are enough people here who want to do it,

85
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.690 
to build a paper, then let's do it and then enough people have said yes and then enough people have said yes and then enough people have said yes.

86
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.450 
also built a result.

87
00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:50.179 
I can perhaps also say something about this aspect, because at that time I was involved in the board of the software working group.

88
00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:57.539 
Engineering and Architecture, and that shows that it is precisely this open format that the colleague from the IEEE has just described.

89
00:08:57.539 --> 00:09:05.009 
to such results and also to such activation of the potential, which hopefully is here in the room today.

90
00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:15.169 
and how this paper project came into being, from the Bitkom strategy, in the area of

91
00:09:15.169 --> 00:09:16.480 
sustainability.

92
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.779 
It was then taken to the working groups.

93
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.720 
We have always had excellent support from the Bitkom office, which then said here, what is the problem?

94
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.950 
on the agenda for the working group this year?

95
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.720 
And that's how they came up with the idea.

96
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.279 
How about writing a white paper with the members of the working group?

97
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.549 
And so that was sort of the journey that led up to this course today.

98
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.419 
And that is also for me personally, for example, a very strong concern.

99
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:49.860 
I am co-founder and CTO at Mash Cloud, which is a company that develops a cloud foundation platform, that is

100
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:56.679 
we basically help big companies to go to the cloud and to run it responsibly in the end.

101
00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:02.299 
because if I now imagine a large corporation like Volkswagen for example, which is one of our customers, with

102
00:10:02.299 --> 00:10:08.429 
55,000 employees, then they don't go into a cloud and they don't have just three IT projects in the cloud, but

103
00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:14.409 
they have hundreds to thousands of them and they have to somehow keep track of how they're doing it and they need

104
00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:21.100 
processes and of course they don't just live the technology in the cloud, but this organisational aspect also plays a very important role.

105
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.379 
dimension plays a role.

106
00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:29.049 
How do I now get in such an IT landscape that was previously very centralised yes, I have the data centre, there

107
00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.850 
everyone is running there for this empowerment.

108
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.350 
For the individual development teams who can now all at once help themselves to resources in self-service in the cloud

109
00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:45.429 
and the exciting thing in this dimension that the cloud enables with this aspect of transparency of resource consumption

110
00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:52.820 
of this pay-per-use aspect is that I also have there the individual responsibility of the engineers for their workloads simply

111
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.850 
visible.

112
00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:02.330 
And we also have some great contributions here in the forum, so I like to mention the colleagues from the Otto Solutions Group, who have such a

113
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:10.690 
solution how this responsibility of the engineers can be made transparent internally.

114
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.559 
and to make visible what resources are used there.

115
00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:20.570 
And I think that these are very great developments, very great possibilities to use this technical dimension, which we call

116
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:27.950 
engineers see every day, with the social dimension, what can we actually do with it?

117
00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:35.379 
And that was of course a very strong motivator to set up this course and to give practical handouts.

118
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.639 
Robin,

119
00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:49.480 
Yes, with us it was a bit easier, how I came to the course, Matthias, with whom I work at FrachtWerk

120
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.559 
as a software developer.

121
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.960 
When we work together on projects, Matthias usually takes more of an organisational position.

122
00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.820 
And I look at things more from the technical perspective and he approached me and asked me

123
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.570 
if I would like to assist with a course.

124
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.120 
I asked What is it about?

125
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:12.889 
Yeah, it's about how to actually do sustainable programming and I was thinking cool, why else did that get me

126
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:22.220 
because I think it's a topic that has been neglected in the past and I personally don't like it.

127
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:30.730 
and I simply missed it in my studies, for example, and the chance to pass it on to others myself now.

128
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.330 
I just wanted to use it and yes, I'm glad that we can stand here now after seven months.

129
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:43.580 
Now we can see something, which unfortunately you can't see up here exactly, because we want to be really effective.

130
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:53.100 
to unlock this MOOC all together thank you, thank you and at the same time what we have to do is to

131
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.450 
press.

132
00:12:56.039 --> 00:13:08.240 
This is now such a dangerous live demo, so 3-2-1-0

133
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.210 
Hi, my name is Matthias and today, I would like to invite you to our free course

134
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:20.000 
Sustainable Software Engineering. In this course we will show how the two maybe most important topics of our society today,

135
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.610 
which is digitalization and Climate Change

136
00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:30.340 
can be combined for the good, for instance by using digital tools to save CO2 emissions.

137
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:37.909 
On the other hand digitalization also causes CO2 emission, which we will go into as well.

138
00:13:37.909 --> 00:13:45.960 
Throughout the course we will cover all relevant roles in the context of Sustainable software Engineering, developers, IT-architects and so on and we will take each role's perspective on this subject.

139
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:54.629 
Finally, we will also show how to practically apply methods to save CO2 in all relevant context of software

140
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:59.009 
engineering also using programming examples.

141
00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:07.100 
So, to successfully complete the course, fundamentals of programming in python are mandatory. At the very end of the course you will have

142
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:13.250 
a good and even practical understanding to do software engineering in a sustainable way yourself.

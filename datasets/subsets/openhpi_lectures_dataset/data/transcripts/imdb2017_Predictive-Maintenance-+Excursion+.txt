1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.800 
Just to give you a flavor of where
we are going with our applications.

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.130 
John Deere, it was two
years ago that John Deere

3
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.190 
participated in one of the
regular presentations where

4
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.230 
we reported the progress of
HANA and the applications on top

5
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.280 
of HANA. And they said they
asked me, was actually here,

6
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.340 
not here, it was in Heidelberg
castle, wonderful summer evening

7
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.380 
and they asked me, shall we do
big bang everything new on HANA

8
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.420 
now, instantly, or
shall we do a future

9
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.470 
a project, which is extending
by far beyond what we currently

10
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.500 
do with your ear
pieces and i said lets

11
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.540 
probably do the
letter first.

12
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.600 
They built a system with
a SAP's help on HANA

13
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.640 
which takes all the
sensors from the tractors,

14
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.710 
an expensive tractor costs three
hundred fifty to four hundred thousand

15
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.780 
euro. It has pretty big wheels. I just was in
MekPo (Meklemburg Vorpommern, region of Germany)

16
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.810 
and you see a few of those
they have big ones there

17
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
in western Germany
we have smaller ones

18
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
they have real big ones.
So all these big ones

19
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.930 
are fully sensorized and beam
that the sensors are permanently

20
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.990 
beaming and then there is
the farmer and the farmer is

21
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.103 
using the tractor basically
every day and has a feeling like

22
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.105 
for for a horse,
that something is not

23
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:51.111 
right, probably the
gearboxes having a

24
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:56.116 
difficult to shift or it
doesn't stop instantly, whatever

25
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.121 
or the left rear wheel is
getting hotter than normal so

26
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.125 
they know things like
this, they call of the

27
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:11.131 
the John Deere services department
and say there is something

28
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:16.000 
coming, so please take care of me
here, if I don't have my tractor

29
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.139 
when I have to harvest,
a hell will break loose

30
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.143 
because these poor guys have
only a few days for harvesting

31
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:28.148 
and if then they see on television
that the thunderstorms coming

32
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:32.152 
they go out and harvest and if
the tractor is not working it's

33
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:38.158 
a disaster. So this, the tractor
has to work basically all the time

34
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.161 
but a hundred percent when
it's harvesting time or

35
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:47.167 
the early season can
be a day or two later

36
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:53.173 
but harvesting is spot on. So
they get all this information

37
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.178 
and they get the written
reports, so this is text

38
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.182 
and the reports they
get from the from the

39
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.185 
to John Deere representatives and
everything goes into one system

40
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.191 
and with the mathematical routines,
which were provided by John

41
00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.193 
Deere and coded by
some people in SAP

42
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.195 
we build the predictive

43
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:21.201 
maintenance system which is
now automatically building

44
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:25.205 
clusters of information which
are relevant to engineers and

45
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:29.209 
the engineers look at it
and come to conclusions

46
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.212 
that they have to
change something

47
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:37.217 
preemptively or they see
there's an emergency coming

48
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:42.222 
and they deal with the individual
case of a customer and prepare

49
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:46.226 
maintenance, call the tractor
for maintenance call it in or

50
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:50.230 
send somebody there to replace,
most of the time in electronic

51
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.234 
part is failing actually not
the many mechanical parts,

52
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.236 
so that there is
preventive maintenance.

53
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.242 
The system is up and running
since eight weeks now.

54
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.245 
It has such an
unbelievable response time

55
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.249 
as newly programmed
it's extremely fast

56
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.253 
and because it's so fast
and it has a decent design

57
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:18.258 
the engineers had planned
two weeks of training

58
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:22.262 
so ten training days, after two days
they stopped and said it's enough

59
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.265 
we know the system so we
start working. This is

60
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.269 
never happened in the forty
years of SAP's history at

61
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:33.273 
least, so might be other companies
have a better track record

62
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.276 
there, but we never had somebody
canceling a training session

63
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.280 
after twenty percent time
because they have learned

64
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.284 
everything and when the system
is so fast your work so fast

65
00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.286 
is so quickly and then
you understand it.

66
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.289 
So the engineers are now
working every day with that

67
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.294 
and now every month or two
months it goes down one model

68
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.298 
further down,
unfortunately my little

69
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.302 
a lawn mower I have is also
John Deere looks like a big one

70
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:06.306 
everybody wants to ride
on him but has no sensors,

71
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:11.311 
so i i do not participate
in this game, but the system

72
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.314 
the tractor works anyway
for four years now.

73
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:20.320 
They think this could
be a one to two billion

74
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.325 
dollar difference in business,
now think about every single

75
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:33.333 
product, more complex product,
pumps, aircraft engines, aircrafts

76
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:39.339 
car engines, cars, electronic
components in cars.

77
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.343 
Everything is now sensorized
has sensors and they're all

78
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:48.348 
sending the data, this is where
this is another source where

79
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:53.353 
we get the really big data.
We can digest this data

80
00:05:54.354 --> 00:06:00.360 
basically on the fly and analyze
it on demand or the other

81
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.364 
way we can now from the system
ask the engineers on demand,

82
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.366 
please look into it, I
have something which is

83
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:11.371 
which is interesting here and
the complicated math they're

84
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.374 
using is only possible so to
use in the system of this kind

85
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:19.379 
here. There is an unbelievable
quality improvement

86
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.385 
in reliability in serviceability
of complicated products

87
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:29.389 
on the horizon, actually
there are two large

88
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.394 
initiatives, one in the U.S,
one in Germany here with what is

89
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.395 
it called 4.0 industry?

90
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.399 
Industry 4.0 where all
these machine manufacturing

91
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:44.404 
companies are together
and and I think

92
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:50.410 
this type of the system can
really help because we can

93
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.414 
digest quickly huge amount
of data, we don't do anything

94
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:58.418 
I said this already fifty times,
we don't do any aggregation

95
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:04.424 
every single every single
response will be produced on

96
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:08.428 
demand, probably we use some
caching but this is invisible

97
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:14.434 
not only to the end user but
it's invisible to the application

98
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:20.440 
programmer and we can analyze
structured and unstructured data

99
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.445 
basically on the fly, even if
there's a huge amount of data

100
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.448 
and it's not historical data
it is as online as it can be

101
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.450 
huge difference.

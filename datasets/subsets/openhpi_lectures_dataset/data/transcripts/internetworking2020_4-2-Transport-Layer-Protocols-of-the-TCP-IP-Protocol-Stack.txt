00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.760 
In our openHPI course - A
Half Century of Internet

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.250 
now we consider the transport layer
protocols on the TCP/IP protocol stack

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.110 
you remember, we have this protocol
stack as the TCP/IP protocol stack

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.810 
hardware layer, link layer, internet
layer, transport layer and application

5
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.860 
layer and now we consider the
protocols on the transmission layer

6
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
the protocols on the transport
layer are based on IP

7
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.160 
an IP is a connection that
services in the internet layer

8
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
and best-known protocol on the
transport layer is a TCP protocol

9
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.490 
the transmission
control protocol

10
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.240 
TCP is able to do the
seemingly impossible

11
00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.560 
based on an unreliable IP protocol TCP
offers a reliable transmission service

12
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.400 
for data exchange between two
communication partners in the internet

13
00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:14.600 
and the basic idea how this
is possible that using an

14
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.290 
unreliable packet service
transport service

15
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.500 
the IP protocol and providing a reliable
transmission service is that TCP

16
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.520 
corrects all the shortcomings and
all the errors of the IP protocol

17
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.910 
beside IP, the very complex
well-designed transmission control

18
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.940 
protocols, the TCP protocol
contributed most to the

19
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.430 
success of the internet

20
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.880 
and then beside of TCP there is a much
simpler UDP protocol - the user

21
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.020 
datagram protocol, it is another
basic transport protocol

22
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.570 
in the TCP/IP protocol stack
and it offers a simple

23
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.070 
insecure and connectionless
transmission service in the internet

24
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.940 
so while TCP provides a connection-based
transmission service, UDP

25
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.090 
similar like IP provides a
connectionless transmission service

26
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.920 
and has not for that reason
because a simple structured

27
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.260 
it has not undergone much change in its
history because of the simple design

28
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.770 
in contrast to UDP, TCP
is connection-oriented

29
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.020 
full duplex transmission service
in the internet and is very

30
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.390 
complex and subject to
constant development

31
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.830 
so we will spend most of our time
speaking about the transport protocols

32
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
with speaking about TCP

33
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.030 
There are further transport protocols
on the TCP/IP protocol stack

34
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.930 
which are based on TCP or
UDP, sometimes on both

35
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.370 
I already mentioned either ISO/T1
up to ISO/T4, NetBIOS, Real

36
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.350 
time protocols - RTP protocol, the system and
network architecture which are important

37
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.920 
in the context of video transporting we
will see why for such kind of services

38
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.510 
a UDP is used while for the most thing
like e-mail or the world wide web

39
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.770 
The TCP protocol
is used

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.750 
Welcome to our OpenHPI course on Mastering
design thinking in large organizations,

2
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.230 
my name is Falk and today we are
talking about organization

3
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.640 
anchoring and business
models for design thinking.

4
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.350 
Today I would address two things,
first of all, I would like

5
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.670 
to show you the possibilities
where larger organizations are

6
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.580 
usually anchoring design thinking
initiatives and design thinking

7
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.560 
as a process and development
method inside an organization.

8
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.120 
For this particular part we will
look into a study that we

9
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.020 
have recently conducted in 2020, and I hope

10
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.960 
that I can show you some insights, how
organizations handle that topic.

11
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.980 
Secondly, I would like to address the
business model for design thinking. So

12
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.850 
how do you position from a selling point. Design
thinking in an organization environment

13
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
and what we are doing, other organizations that
might inspire yourself or your organizations.

14
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.080 
To move on with design
thinking, let's start

15
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
by looking at our design
thinking implementation bill.

16
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.360 
You are already familiar with
this and today's lecture will

17
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.320 
address the third topic, i.e.
highlighted right now.

18
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.410 
So we're looking more into the
question where is it anchored?

19
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770 
Where do we need to place this and
what is the value proposition?

20
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.500 
Based on the strategy
inside the organization,

21
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.560 
organization of anchoring as I said
in the beginning we have conducted

22
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.350 
a study, a global study with
organizations from all over the

23
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.310 
world and different
sectors.

24
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.090 
And to introduce you and make
you familiar with that study,

25
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.010 
it is based on more than
400 hundred participants

26
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.250 
and it's showing right now on the x
scale, the years of implementation

27
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.750 
and on the y scale the share of
respondents and the question

28
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.830 
that was asked is when did you
introduce design thinking?

29
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.420 
And what is interesting to look
at is that design thinking

30
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.990 
really goes back for a very long time, so we
got the first response from 1980

31
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.990 
on the left hand side
of this chart,

32
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.240 
and as you clearly see it was
a long prolonged time in the

33
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.300 
beginning from 1980 to maybe 2005 almost nothing happened

34
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.980 
in the industry. So just a few known
companies from the tech industry mostly

35
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.770 
they hooked up this methodology
and used it internally but

36
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.950 
not many others. But if you are
familiar with the history of

37
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.040 
design thinking you know in 2003-2004

38
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.320 
the first players started to adopt more
this kind of method and mindset

39
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.400 
and you can see see
clearly there's increase

40
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.990 
within the curve that happened
from 2005 onward

41
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.530 
and what is also interesting to
look at is that most of the

42
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.020 
organizations who have picked up
there's knowledge around design

43
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.970 
thinking seemed to be located
in the service sector.

44
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.290 
For sure also industry and
manufacturing industry are picking

45
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.550 
up and also the energy sector,
transport sector, especially if

46
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.960 
you look in the years from 2016-17 on
47
00:03:46.540 --&gt; 00:03:52.000
there is a steeper increase
in numbers. But if you look

48
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.110 
at the overall distribution between the
different industries then it's obvious

49
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.710 
that design thinking is sticking
very much to the service sector,

50
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.140 
and when we conducted our first
study around the design thinking

51
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.090 
implementation here at HPI in 2015 but we

52
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.750 
already thought that we are reaching
the peak of the implementation soon

53
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.540 
but as you can see clearly on on
that chart 2015

54
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.820 
is less than 50 percent
of today's implementation.

55
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.300 
And to remind you on that a study
here 2020,

56
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.720 
it is not reflecting the entire year
it's just reflecting half of years. So

57
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.320 
we expect that there is more growth even
coming in 2020.

58
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.060 
And the interpretation
of that chart is

59
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.440 
by looking at design thinking
introductions by industry sectors

60
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.040 
that the design thinking
implementation wave is by far not

61
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.750 
over, is it's still ongoing and we expect
even in 2020 a steep increase

62
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.120 
of implementation efforts
happening in organizations.

63
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.110 
So but what does that do. This has to
do with the organization anchoring

64
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.020 
we asked all those companies who
participated as part of this study,

65
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.500 
where do you locate
design-thinking

66
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.880 
and this chart shows a comparison
between our first study which

67
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.300 
we conducted in 2015, with over 200

68
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.100 
participants and our
recent study and

69
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.200 
in the recent study in 2020 we got more

70
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.330 
than 350  answers
and to read the chart correctly

71
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.000 
you have to see that multiple
responses were allowed. So one

72
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.050 
organization could have that we
use for example, design thinking

73
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.210 
in sales and HR and
another department.

74
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.090 
So by looking at the numbers and
the proportions you clearly

75
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.810 
see on the first claims by looking
at the 2020 numbers

76
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.610 
that research and development is
the largest recipient of design

77
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.110 
thinking in an organization. So we
have nearly 55-56%

78
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.990 
of organizations are using
design thinking in a structured way

79
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.470 
as part of their r d initiatives but
also all the other departments

80
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.940 
that are traditionally located in
organizations are now adopting

81
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.410 
in using design thinking for their own
purposes. Ao namely, the internet consulting,

82
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.610 
the marketing department,
sales, human resources and also

83
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.910 
operations and manufacturing and even
finance and accounting is picking up.

84
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.860 
So maybe, let's look at the
comparison between the 2 years.

85
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.290 
2020 and 2015,
so there is a 5 years gap

86
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.230 
and what I would like to highlight
as part of this study is

87
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:08.840 
that two areas namely IT and
operations and manufacturing have

88
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.570 
catched up and have been using
design-thinking even more

89
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.670 
since then since, 2015.
And what interesting and it matches

90
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:25.530 
exactly with my own industry experience
as well is that operations

91
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.660 
and manufacturing almost doubled
the use of design thinking

92
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.220 
for their internal processes and
the same is happening with

93
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:45.280 
studies that we have conducted in a
other parts of our research process.

94
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.210 
We have been figuring out that especially
operations and manufacturing

95
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.390 
is now looking into this
method because

96
00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:00.210 
the digitization of manufacturing
and also automation is driving

97
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.490 
them to think more big and to rethink
manufacturing in operations

98
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:11.880 
procedures from a complete new perspective and
therefore more organizations are getting

99
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.750 
perceptible to this method set
because it promises that you

100
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.160 
can reshape your manufacturing from
a complete new point of view.

101
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.860 
Secondly, by looking at the idea,
departments one of the highlight

102
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.960 
reasons why they are starting
to adopt is also the increase

103
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.190 
in digitization and the upcoming
of new applications. No matter

104
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.190 
if its back-end systems
like SAP or

105
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.340 
cutting edge applications that you
can buy on on different app stores,

106
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.190 
IT departments are more and more
using design thinking to

107
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.690 
shape their applications in
a more user-centred and

108
00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.970 
human-centered way so this is
somehow explaining this increase

109
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.300 
especially in the two areas that are
highlighted here in this chart.

110
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:12.660 
But furthermore, we have been asking in
our recent study the organizations

111
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.900 
as well where do you
see design-thinking

112
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.210 
applied in the future

113
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.230 
and on the left hand side
you see the present

114
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.950 
way of using design thinking. So
the numbers that you just saw

115
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.620 
on the other chart and then on
the right hand side you see

116
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.170 
the future and
we asked them

117
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.610 
in 3 years from now so it's
basically in two thousand and

118
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.090 
twenty three what do you as an
organization expect to use

119
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.170 
design thinking and coming back
to the two departments that

120
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.770 
I have been talking about you see
again another huge increase.

121
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.230 
So in operations and manufacturing it
will go from roughly 22 percent

122
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.020 
to up to 36%

123
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.050 
and also in from 34-49%.

124
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.430 
But also all the other departments are
having a steep increase in the application

125
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:16.520 
of design thinking. So summing
this up and may trying to make

126
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.940 
sense out of it is that design thinking
has become a material discipline

127
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.520 
which is not just been done
in one or two departments

128
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.830 
in your organization but most
organizations are adopting design

129
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:36.170 
thinking and implementing it more
widely and the anchoring is happening

130
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.460 
not just in in one part of the organization
but in most of the scenarios.

131
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.580 
We see it sticking to different
business departments.

132
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.840 
But let's take another perspective onto
this organization anchoring topic

133
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.250 
and the theoretical framework
that I would like to highlight

134
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.450 
here is coming from Jung.
She introduced it in

135
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.840 
2009 so it's
quite old but still valid at

136
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.260 
least from my
point of view.

137
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.670 
And the authors at that time
proposed for implementation nodes.

138
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:21.320 
One is designed as an external source and resource
it's basically sourcing design thinking

139
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:27.010 
from an external agency, design
agency, or professional agency.

140
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.140 
The second anchoring mode they
saw was designed as part of

141
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.740 
the organization, so not the entire
organization is taking it but

142
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.180 
isolated business departments or
product units are absorbing it.

143
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.250 
Then the third paradigm they identified
as part of their own studies was

144
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.630 
design at the core of the
organization, so the central units

145
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:56.630 
like operations in manufacturing or on
adopting it and then the last one

146
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.810 
and this is basically also
perceived as the highest maturity

147
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.430 
for design thinking applications,
was seeing design as an integral

148
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.490 
part of the organization,
meaning that all entities

149
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.570 
that are involved in the inner
part of an organization

150
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.350 
have absorbed
this knowledge.

151
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.870 
And we also investigated
this is part of the study

152
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:27.250 
and just to show you some
results here again this

153
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.980 
is a comparison between the2015 study

154
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.300 
and the 2020,

155
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.010 
and we have been asking the
participants if design thinking

156
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.480 
is just localized in parts of the
organization or if it's embedded

157
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.770 
in the overall corporate culture or if
it's been used as an external resource

158
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:52.170 
and in the upper part you see
clearly the application and part

159
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.010 
of the organization hasn't
been changed much,

160
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.420 
so most of the
respondents said yup it's

161
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.230 
with 71-72%

162
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.840 
it's been used
partially

163
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.340 
but what's
interesting is

164
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.780 
in comparing 2015 with
2020

165
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:19.710 
is that there is a steep decline in using
design-thinking as external resource,

166
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:26.930 
and instead the and betterment of design
thinking into the overall corporate culture

167
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.270 
has increased by around
33 percent right.

168
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.920 
So the interpretation here is
and we can match this here at

169
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.280 
HPI have of all the training
and education efforts that we

170
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.830 
have put into
into practice

171
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.170 
that more and more
organizations are becoming

172
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:51.000 
mature. So they get trained,
they increase the level of

173
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.260 
capabilities for their own employees
in the organization and by doing so

174
00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.250 
they become independent from
external knowledge that is helping

175
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:05.870 
them to run projects based on design
thinking and they incorporate it

176
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:11.870 
successfully either as part of their
organization or what makes us

177
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.180 
also happy as researchers in that
field they even manage it to embed

178
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.490 
design thinking into the
entire corporate culture.

179
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.230 
So these are promising results
and we believe based on our

180
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.900 
qualitative interviews that we
conduct with practitioners as well

181
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.410 
that the embedding part will
drastically increase over the

182
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.300 
next 3 to 5 years. So
this is not the end, we rather

183
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.270 
believe that this is somewhere in the
middle, so the adoption rates and

184
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.480 
cultural adoption rate it is
just the beginning to start so

185
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.890 
now, for the second part of this course
let's look at the business model and

186
00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.700 
the business model is the
way how design thinking

187
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.850 
it is basically anchored from
a financial point of view in

188
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.550 
the organization and how the offerings
are made to the business departments.

189
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.690 
And and the first step would we
figured out is that there still

190
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.800 
an ongoing debate between central
funding of design-thinking

191
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.300 
initiatives and
decentralised funding

192
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:29.820 
and our recent findings indicate that
especially the central funding

193
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.410 
for design-thinking initiatives
is needed in the very beginning

194
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.310 
if an organisation starts to
implement design thinking

195
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.900 
there is usually not enough knowledge
available in the organization.

196
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.320 
To see the value immediately from
such a method and therefore

197
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.690 
organizations are tending
to set up central funds

198
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.500 
top management, middle
management support,

199
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:03.080 
in order to have a smooth start so to
lower down the barrier in organization,

200
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.950 
to try out this methodology because
through the central funding

201
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.230 
the use of the method is getting
basically paid internally

202
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.020 
and therefore business
departments are more

203
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.910 
more open to experiment
with this method set.

204
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:26.090 
But what we see is as soon as the
majority and the acceptance

205
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.020 
starts within an
organization,

206
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.040 
no matter if we are talking about
the mindset of design thinking

207
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:39.990 
or process or tools organizations are shifting,
than to a decentralized funding mode

208
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.070 
that means that the top
management believes that

209
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.640 
design-thinking needs to
pay itself by providing so much

210
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.270 
value to the business departments
or to product development

211
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.640 
efforts service development
that it needs to get refunded by

212
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.360 
such efforts. So this is basically
then shifting over time into

213
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.260 
a decentralised funding model,
where design thinking and the

214
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:15.760 
way how it's been offered to such
teams it is funded by those

215
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.520 
projects themselves without
having a huge central funding.
.
216
00:17:21.320 --&gt; 00:17:27.890
For sure there are modes in between, it's
a kind of federalism where

217
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:34.560 
we have in some organizations also part
of the centre of funding still stay

218
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:41.680 
why other parts or decentralised
this is mostly happening when

219
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.490 
organizations still believe that
a lot of training efforts

220
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.010 
needs to be done than they keep
especially for the training

221
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.860 
efforts the center of funding alive
while on the operational base

222
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.550 
design-thinking needs to get a
decentralised funding from product

223
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.340 
efforts and product
development projects.

224
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.510 
The second way how you can look
at the business model and the

225
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:13.370 
funding of design thinking is by
looking at the shape of the entities

226
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.510 
and what we see at the current
moment is that there are four

227
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.530 
different business model
pattern exists in an industry,

228
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.270 
one that might be familiar
with your own organization

229
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.810 
we call innovation
units,

230
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.710 
and innovation units
are units where R&amp;D

231
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.850 
or new product development usually happens.
And mostly these innovation units are

232
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.960 
built up around digital transformation
efforts and their concrete goal is

233
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.580 
to build new product and
service innovations

234
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.280 
as part of R&amp;D efforts and such
innovation units are building

235
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.920 
up their own expertise and development and
research. They have different disciplines

236
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.670 
usually come together from design
software engineering,

237
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:14.530 
and they usually work in interdisciplinary
teams and in dedicated project so

238
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.810 
they are little islands

239
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.770 
and their business model is basically
that they work on patterns

240
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.170 
or product innovations
by themselves.

241
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:31.580 
The second model that we usually
observe our so called innovation

242
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.810 
groups or we call them
innovation groups,

243
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:40.080 
innovation groups differ from innovation
units and a way that the innovation group

244
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.800 
it's not necessarily doing the product
and service innovation spite himself

245
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.150 
but rather than helping the
business entities to using design

246
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.770 
thinking to come up with product
and service innovations. So

247
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:59.080 
it's more supporting function that is then focused
on the culture transformation and enablement

248
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:06.200 
have people instead of claiming
the innovation by themselves.

249
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:12.330 
So their intention is usually to provide
tools, method, process guidelines,

250
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.530 
to the business departments and
most often they also conduct

251
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.020 
the trainings and coaching, so the
outcome measures for them internally

252
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.660 
is usually a number of trainings
they have conducted the people

253
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:30.210 
who have attended the number of people or
the projects they support internally with

254
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.270 
design thinking.

255
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:41.780 
Observation we make is lead organizations
just look at projects, so they

256
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.840 
do not emphasize so much the
innovation topic itself, but

257
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.940 
they look into
the projects

258
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.630 
and the business model here
for design thinking is that

259
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.830 
it helps those projects to become
more customer centric, more

260
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.550 
human centric that the
outcomes are just

261
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.400 
creating higher usability and a
much better experience to the

262
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.600 
ones who will be using products
and services later on.

263
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.490 
And the decision for

264
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.360 
design thinking is then basically
based on a project by project

265
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.630 
base, so there is no usually, no general
rule applicable for organizations

266
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:28.200 
that says I do it always like
this, but in most cases

267
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.110 
if it happens just on
the project level,

268
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.170 
the project owner, the project
manager is deciding if they want

269
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.820 
to go with design-thinking
as a tool or not.

270
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.660 
And then, as we also talked as part of
the anchoring discussion already about

271
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:49.730 
is that the fourth model is
external resource. So looking

272
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:55.220 
at design-thinking as an external
resource, itdoes unmanned support

273
00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.260 
of business units on a
project by project base,

274
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.920 
and the advantage is clearly that you can
turn it on and off whenever you want.

275
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:09.740 
So it's on-demand business model
to the business units basically

276
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.590 
that was the theoretical framing of
our lecture and course of today.

277
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.670 
So we try to give you some insights
in organizational anchoring

278
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.740 
by looking into the results of our recent
study that we have conducted this year,

279
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.520 
and I try to give you an overview of the
business models that has been applied

280
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.660 
within organization when it
comes to design thinking.

281
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.850 
So finally, let's look at the
implementation wheel again, what

282
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.880 
we cover today is the rare part,
basically the organization

283
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.400 
anchoring and the business model
and the data that I provided

284
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.790 
to you are coming from a study
that we have recently conducted

285
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.770 
on a global level with organizations
from different industries.

286
00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.710 
And I hope that I was able to
provide you good insight on where

287
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:05.120 
to position design thinking and
also how to se  it internally.

288
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.660 
Thank you very much for listening
today and see you for our next

289
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.820 
course. Thank you.

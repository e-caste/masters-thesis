00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.320 
Welcome to our speaker series on Mastering
design thinking in organizations.

2
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.690 
I'm Danielly DePaula and here
I have Falk with me.

3
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.810 
And the topic of this conversation
is education and training.

4
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.640 
And for that we have the pleasure of
having this conversation with

5
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.610 
Christian Steiger from HAUFE.Group LeXWARE.
Christian has extensive experience of

6
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.690 
developing digital products
through innovative methodologies.

7
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.720 
Thank you very much for this,
I'm turning red a little

8
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.890 
bit right now, but yeah
My name is Christian, and I've been working

9
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.750 
for Haufe now, since
ten years ago before there was

10
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.260 
the Haufe, but then I left Haufe,
then I had my old style in the

11
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.490 
live streaming area which you're
talking about speeding in

12
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.080 
this area, ten years ago it was
something more new perhaps.

13
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.860 
And concentrating in Haufe in the
role of the management director

14
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.440 
for this new products and new
products means also how to change

15
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.680 
processes, how to change attitudes,
and yeah and I think you

16
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.820 
today want to discuss a little
bit of what we learned there

17
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.340 
and sometimes even purposely hard
learning tool, but also what

18
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.830 
we saw in august, scaling effects.
And that at the end of the

19
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.020 
day it's all about europe having success
in the market, because when organisation

20
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.680 
and we have to pay our employees
and there's a spot to be that

21
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.090 
by you want to be successful
in the market. And

22
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.890 
and last one of my most

23
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.720 
guiding things perhaps is
coming more from this

24
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.550 
blue-ocean, a topic for markets. A
very good book that's written,

25
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.800 
that in the first sights, no company,
no industry will succeed

26
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.850 
in long term. So it was another
sentence in the long term

27
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.330 
or debt on a long run they are all
dead and it's true. So

28
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.060 
you have to reinvent, you have
to invent, otherwise you will

29
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.960 
fail and you will disappear in the market.
That's not what you want to achieve.

30
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.720 
That surviving started ten years
ago, thenthis beautiful guy

31
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.210 
called Falk, in our organisation did
first design-thinking integration.

32
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.660 
Christian, can you tell us,
to our audience, why is it

33
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.840 
so important to build this
capability of design thinking. What

34
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.940 
I love about design thinking is that,
it is also close to this agile

35
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.310 
words, I mean sometimes it comes
up a little that these words are

36
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
coming in a buzzy
area, but if you really think

37
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.340 
about it, it's about
the attitude, how you think about

38
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.400 
building new products. So design
thinking for example

39
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.620 
is on one hand the process, on the
other hand is how to put the

40
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.030 
user's needs into
the center.

41
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.480 
Because if you're not able to, especially in
the software business and

42
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.850 
I think in every business, but I
come from the software side,

43
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.760 
that's why talking about this. I'm
building a successful software, but

44
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.770 
don't understand the need
from a customer.

45
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.960 
In this designing thinking has a major
strength in my opinion. In its first

46
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.730 
iteration, at one building a product
understanding, how can you fit to the needs

47
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.860 
because if you're wrong there and
you build later with bigger

48
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.730 
team, software it becomes extremely
expensive and you will fail.

49
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.250 
And what I also learned is more
the acute side from the

50
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.250 
design thinking is it's not easy

51
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.540 
to observe something, to see to
understand, what is the need,

52
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.540 
because nobody tells you need,
it should be the discussions

53
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.640 
and observations customers see.
Perhaps their problems and their

54
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.280 
tale about their problems. For
this and the learned this

55
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.770 
10 years ago that there is
a difference between

56
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.880 
talking about problems and talking
about needs behind the

57
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.800 
system, that thing. You have to do on your
own as your homework, so to say,

58
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.360 
to translate the problems and how
they thought for today into

59
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.940 
a need and then go forward
with the product.

60
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.500 
And till today we introduce
their so-called swap strategy,

61
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.650 
which is scout proof deliver and till
today, now about 9 years running here

62
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.290 
because the scout or perhaps I would
call it today Explore

63
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.070 
that design thinking is more
about understanding the

64
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.330 
customers, second then is the
proof, the business proof.

65
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.010 
So is it really makable,
in the sense of

66
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.790 
technology, but also
is that makeable in the sense

67
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.490 
of revenue and profit.

68
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.470 
And last is then the

69
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.790 
phase everybody start scaling, had
have more teams in place, all these

70
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.520 
agile process running up

71
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.110 
and so it's like,

72
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.180 
if you fail in the design thinking
part, in the first part, you

73
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.490 
will have an epic fail in the last,
in the delivery part. So it is

74
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.220 
very very important to have
a very special eye on it. And

75
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.780 
then we learned that there's
not so many people who are able

76
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.560 
or are good in observing.
For example, if you

77
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.710 
show people sometimes, say a
picture where there's a tree,

78
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.540 
and there's somebody

79
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.830 
lying with the eyes
closed, and you ask what can you

80
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.500 
see here? Many people will
say a sleeping men,

81
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.340 
but you can't see a sleeping man.
You can describe there's a

82
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.940 
man lying with the eyes shut up and
so on. So it's very hard

83
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.120 
from the kinds of very good
and trained to understand

84
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.060 
this, how to get this
need. And I mean that you look

85
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.810 
at our product, which is quite
successful in German market, which

86
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.230 
is called LexWare, really starting
at this fine and today we have onboard

87
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.210 
100,000 plus customers on this and it

88
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.920 
started with
this core need.

89
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.760 


90
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.940 
There was the small business
areas, about bookkeeping,

91
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.440 
but it didn't ask for bookkeeping.
How they do it, they want

92
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.250 
to understand what is the driver?
But then what is there really

93
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.400 
need behind
that, this is

94
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.720 
where I am today and in the future.
But nobody tells you that,

95
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.800 
because nobody tells you an.
abstract thing with the future

96
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.740 
It's more from this problem spaces
and they are still running

97
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.390 
for this still today,

98
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.840 
I'm wondering Christian,
you're such a prominent player

99
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.140 
in the German market for digital
products nowadays, but how

100
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.500 
did it start in such an early
phase around 2010,
101
00:07:24.500 --&gt; 00:07:29.230
2009? At least
from my own experience, almost

102
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.920 
no one was thinking about human-centered
design, design thinking,

103
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.110 
for sure. The very sad was the
software companies in the

104
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.770 
market started to adopt that.
How did it happen to you?

105
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.110 
and then maybe later on we can
talk more specifically about

106
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.830 
how to educate people
how to train them, and

107
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.490 
how to change partners. Maybe we
can first focus on the spot,

108
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.160 
in point in the beginning what
did it come from and how did it

109
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.330 
evolve? Very honestly, it
comes also from a

110
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:08.080 
for many fails and frustration. We've
tried several times inside the company,

111
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.680 
but the teams still revert
to existing customers, their

112
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.850 
staff and and they get so now
bring up the innovation

113
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.760 
for the new customers, and we
tried it many times. And

114
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.310 
we often had this, not because
we have the wrong people

115
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.930 
or something, or
we have

116
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.400 
not enough money to invest in something,
that was not the reason. The

117
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.880 
reason is that in this system
as it is, it's very

118
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.600 
hard to have this change running
or bring both onto the existing

119
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.920 
customers, but also on
the new customers.

120
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.000 
And as we thought, every
attempt, or every approach didn't

121
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.780 
work out.We have to
try this totally different

122
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.880 
thought, then our big holding
decided to build a

123
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.930 
new, so to say area. And they
totally have the freedom

124
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.650 
to back how they
think it's right.

125
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.740 
And that only your
system that where they think.

126
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.850 
These are right, but
just to ask this,

127
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.950 
this new department was
internally set up right?

128
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.350 
So it was not an external,
no it was internal,

129
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.310 
and which I
love about it is a

130
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.360 
yesterday the others were one
thing, but the other thing is

131
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.350 
that the idea of the they're
not something like

132
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.820 
a lab or a garage or whatever.
Honestly, I don't like that so

133
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.460 
much because for me it's very very
important that your objective if

134
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.540 
to bring something in the market,
not only an idea. Because our

135
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.500 
other service ideas,
scouting, ideas yes

136
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.880 
it is not the problem, it's about
the people who bring them

137
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.920 
in the market. Because ideas then
like design thinking change,

138
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.670 
and are evolving, they change, the evolve,
they keep coming next years,

139
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.820 
this is the normal way,
so it's very hard work.

140
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:16.790 
And it was then in internal, but they
are very separate though the hour

141
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:21.280 
I'm holding. these people
are free that they put the head

142
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.080 
on a weight so that they
don't get touched by the

143
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.790 
strong organization, which are
responsible for the profit because

144
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.710 
either they invest at once,
so we had no profit.

145
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.610 
And the next thing is that we also
learned that it's very important

146
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.790 
that you face tests that mention
this strategy, that you say

147
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.100 
even just for finding needs will
gave us both I think it was

148
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.810 
just close to one year

149
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.850 
and at that times it was
something very ridiculous, here

150
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.050 
there was the product we want to sell it and stuff,

151
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.790 
and no that is
not what will happen.

152
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.160 
Hopefully, we'll have
something to in the next phase,

153
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.350 
and this was, it was also learning,
but it was very good to have

154
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.020 
this clarification about what is
the outcome in the first place,

155
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.760 
and this is about a qualified need.
And this helps as a lot in

156
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.990 
the
management to

157
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.560 
get a better understanding
what these outcomes are,

158
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.290 
often seen in other companies that
they are distracted by only

159
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.810 
ideas and there's never something
showing happen and after.

160
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.660 
Every CEO have some fun with these
labs and have some

161
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.580 
photos and some press releases,
says ok now I'm stopping it

162
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.510 
because it has no outcome.

163
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.740 
And this really helps because then
we are family owned business,

164
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.300 
and we have no money from
outside, they can be saved but

165
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.290 
I'm willing to pay for his this
phase what's needed and this

166
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.630 
therefore we started with about four
people and with you guys in

167
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.230 
this first stage.

168
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.800 
Just to make it more precise
participants of the class, so

169
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.540 
did you already have a
product mission in mind?

170
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:13.180 
I mean now I would say
LexWare

171
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.840 
is having a product that has
a wider product focus, where

172
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.450 
you can get a weight in but in the
really really beginning what was that?

173
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.730 
What did you still have the
possibility to explore and then

174
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.630 
you nailed it down and you converged
more into a factory for product.

175
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.750 
Thank you, very good
good question. Because

176
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:42.660 
you know we call it a mandate
reset, what is the next

177
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.970 
big thing, what is what
needed by the SBEs or small business

178
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.410 
entrepreneurs, this was a
challenge. This was not

179
00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.060 
that bring up the new bookkeeping
as the task model or something and

180
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.180 
very honestly now when we came
with this need, okay cool! But

181
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.980 
then we then came up with the
first product concept is was

182
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.880 
more little bit frustration by the
management because they were

183
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.090 
you're talking about invoice,
you're talking about this ,

184
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:19.780 
this is not you, it wasn't like they
had become up with an invention

185
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.720 
like Brandenburg or did to invent
invented the mp3 or something

186
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.690 
this is not what you want to
innovate. So it's about selling and

187
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.900 
but this is very much hard because
the people thought we could bring somethinh

188
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.960 
totally, new perhaps the next
banking books so to say, or

189
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.600 
something this was not
easy. We were back to our roots

190
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.440 
but and this was a
cool decision also by

191
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.600 
our management

192
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.080 
not playing in a different way.
So we always said, it's not about what

193
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.580 
you do, it's more about the how
you do it. What I mean is

194
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.340 
the what is the bookkeeping and
invoicing and all the stuff

195
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.380 
but the how thought it
didn't so it didn't

196
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.770 
we didn't care so to say about
existing customers, not that

197
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.030 
we say, of course the common
products, don't get me wrong there,

198
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.900 
but new customers, in a new space, there
online is the game always. Also

199
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.620 
can people build new solutions?
So it's not about copying

200
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.410 
what you have on premier,
the product day is totally

201
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.640 
different to our
on-premise solutions.

202
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.770 
And yet, it's certain it seems
very easy decisions but this

203
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.590 
is very hard because normally
in all the software companies

204
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.000 
you see more like it is now here
and now we bring it in the bed

205
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.880 
and not playing in new business models
strongly believe in this

206
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.520 
business model innovation patents
not other they of course

207
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.400 
need a good product or good solution,
but it's always the whole

208
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.940 
thing you have to think about,
it's not only about the value

209
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.810 
propositions so much more.
Christian, maybe you can share with us some

210
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:09.020 
of your failures, without the details,
about both the main learnings,

211
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.370 
what did you learn from those?
I think I mentoned few,

212
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.470 
but one of them is

213
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:23.010 
stay by your rules. And what I mean
is you then you start something

214
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.620 
like this I would call for many
rules, and not saying principles

215
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.130 
right now, because you all know
about principles, money,

216
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.250 
and all the stuff. I really believe
that you need some

217
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.980 
rules that you can rely on.
218
00:15:34.820 --&gt; 00:15:38.850
In our world it was this concept of

219
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:45.180 
it's all about if in agreement this
comes up to the responsibility,

220
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.720 
speaking things out there you need
trust to get it next agreement.

221
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.440 
So i know this sounds a bit
like blah blah blah blah,

222
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.080 
but if you match this for
example, ground framework

223
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.730 
there you have
this planning,

224
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.960 
this is this part of agreement,
because you put that you take

225
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.050 
some cards, I am going to
deliver this for my team,

226
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.630 
and you take this responsibility
everybody can see and then

227
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.130 
you have to speak something
things out into areas that one

228
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.410 
is is it their, this

229
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.240 
is all about the review, as it is
called in the ground format,

230
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.190 
the next it's what did we learn?

231
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.030 
You're doing this retrospective, but with
more by trust you will not

232
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:37.270 share: with:
anybody what you learnt if you don't have this trust area.

233
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.360 
And then again a loop. And
the next best thing is

234
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.550 
it's all his time box, so we talk about
two weeks. So we don't ask about

235
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:51.270 
what are you bringing next year or in
half a year, because it's not possible.

236
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.160 
But these were very hard
rules. Next hard plan was to

237
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.520 
check back to them in circl
that they always thought that

238
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.030 
planned by the small port
mobile as I described.

239
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.490 
And I will say today, if I
would start again, I would have

240
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.580 
many rules in the beginning.
Because it's very easy

241
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.990 
to keep rules, but it's in my
opinion I would say it's

242
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.290 
not easy to put
new rules in.

243
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.280 
It's very hard if you have things
running and people have now

244
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.410 
in this environment then you
start bringing up something, you

245
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.050 
know its not working at all, you have
very high educated people who

246
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:35.150 
rule themselves so to say. Just to
make it clear also for the audience,

247
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.790 
some people might think
rules are killing trade,

248
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:47.330 
and rules are hindering to be
agile. What is your take on

249
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.550 
that, just to make that clear.
what your opinion is?

250
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.030 
I think rules and structures are
super important,

251
00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.940 
and it is not killing something.
This is

252
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.550 
not true for me as a
rule how you're iterating through

253
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.870 
design thinking process, this is
rules, there is a phase

254
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.630 
called dark horse and it has to be there
that makes sense because many people

255
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:15.180 
educate like this and bring these
things up if you don't have

256
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.040 
schools you bring this is nothing.
Then yes there is something

257
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.750 
like a human force, then you
have display grounds then you

258
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.930 
have to labs where people are
super cool hanging

259
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.970 
in berlin and having
some fun on the table soccer

260
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.770 
whatever is cool
at the moment, this is not

261
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.310 
as for me really not true, it's very
important because the structure

262
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.150 
it must strong belief structure
and built up the culture.

263
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.180 
You can't build culture, but you can
build structures and structures

264
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:52.720 
leads attitudes. I cannot change the
attitude from people, it's not possible

265
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.090 
I can give this environment and
as you see it's open roads

266
00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.050 
it's their smart space to do
things in inside of this and you

267
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.220 
can also play with thisrules, as I spoke
I could say i don't like.

268
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.060 


269
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:13.310 
You can, but if you don't have
something that people can rely on if

270
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.420 
you don't have words like how
many people are in team, how

271
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.750 
did have to process your ability,
the ability and very sure

272
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:25.340 
you have cars that you will don't
succeeded in any way whatever you do,

273
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:30.280 
so it's only natural that rules
are not killing

274
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.150 
creativity or something but no
of course you can give rules

275
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.340 
that do this, but

276
00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:43.450 
you need some things
where you can rely on and this is about

277
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.610 
working together non-stop. So thank
you christian for this talk

278
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.880 
and providing
it's light

279
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:56.700 
on your specific company case but
also sharing experiences on

280
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.960 
innovation and design companies.
So thank you Christian.

281
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.180 
Thank you to all and
listeners of this

282
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.540 
video cast and we look forward to
see you next time again.

283
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.770 
Until then enjoy
wherever you are.

284
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.320 
Thank you.

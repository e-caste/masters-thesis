1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.150 
Now we want to consider some attacks
on cryptographic protocols in our

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.040 
openHPI course about Confidential
Communication in the Internet.

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.080 
If we consider such cryptographic
protocol or shortly crypto-protocol,

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.330 
then the crypto-protocol, for
example the digital signature,

5
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.630 
is based on a cryptosystem. Cryptosystem
means there are the algorithms,

6
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.790 
the hash algorithms,
there is the

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.120 
algorithm for the
encryption of the signature

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.610 
and the cryptosystem uses some crypto
procedures or crypto algorithms.

9
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.220 
So in this way a typical
participant of a crypto protocol

10
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
is Alice. She is the first communication
partner. She is the initiator

11
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
of the communication
in crypto protocol.

12
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.610 
By the way I
remind that in

13
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.170 
other clips I mixed Alice and Bob and Bob
is the second communication partner

14
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.750 
in such a crypto protocol. And
then we have Mallory.

15
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
And Mallory is a
really bad guy and

16
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.770 
Mallory attacks the
communications. Mallory

17
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.380 
wants to know what Alice and
Bob are speaking about

18
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.990 
and when we discuss
how secure are such

19
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.610 
cyber cryptographic protocols, then it's
good to have the model that Mallory

20
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.240 
has unlimited
computational power.

21
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.310 
So Mallory can do all wrong things
and we have to see and we have

22
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.290 
to consider and to guarantee
that it cannot get access

23
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.400 
to the communication
of Alice and Bob.

24
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.110 
The bad guy Mallory has abilities
when listening to a communication channel,

25
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.700 
to record for example
all communications,

26
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.810 
he has ability to manipulate
the tapped data and he is

27
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.920 
able to fake, to forward fake messages
to try to become a man in the middle

28
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.750 
or other things. So this is our
model and what is an attack?

29
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.760 
An attack on cyber protocols can
focus on the protocol itself,

30
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
can focus on the
cryptosystem

31
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.510 
and can focus on the cryptographic algorithms
that are used in the cryptosystem.

32
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.620 
And the attack can be passive. So
the participant or the attacker,

33
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.350 
it could also be a participant
that want to get access to

34
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.040 
the communication of
other participants

35
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.010 
or the attacker from outside follows the
protocol and tries to gain information

36
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.930 
about the participants

37
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.860 
or/and about the
communicated content.

38
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.840 
An active attack is when the participant,
when the attacker from outside

39
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.970 
tries to influence the
work-flow of the protocol

40
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.410 
to get an advantage, to know
something about what they are

41
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.940 
discussing. Now let's
look to a few

42
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.660 
typical attack scenarios. The
first we want to consider is

43
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.620 
a replay attack. Here the idea is to
reuse a previously sent message.

44
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.210 
For example a message with
a name and user password.

45
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.080 
Another common attack are
spoofing attack. Spoofing attacks

46
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.470 
every time are based that the communication
is performed under a false name.

47
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.390 
So the attacker uses an
incorrect IP address,

48
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.780 
the attacker uses
for example an

49
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.500 
incorrect name as the name
of the CEO or others.

50
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.440 
Man in the middle attacks
are attacks where the

51
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.990 
attacker Mallory intervenes unnoticed
by both communication partners

52
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.360 
in the middle and all the
messages Alice sent to Bob

53
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.510 
are considered by Mallory
eventually are modified

54
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.910 
and then the modified
message is sent to Bob.

55
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.780 
And Bob answers. Mallory has a
chance to change or to modify

56
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.430 
this answer before he forwards this to
Alice, so Alice and Bob are not aware

57
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.210 
that there is someone in
the middle, that Mallory

58
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.550 
is sitting in the middle and eventually
is manipulating the messages.

59
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.590 
And Mallory gets a

60
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.310 
complete understanding
of what they both two

61
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.500 
are communicating. So this here is,
Mallory is a man in the middle

62
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.970 
as Alice and Bob they assume to
communicate directly but in

63
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.270 
reality all the communication
goes over the station of

64
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.810 
it goes over the
station of Mallory.

65
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.230 
Another attack type are
hijacking attacks.

66
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.430 
Here from a certain point in time, so
Bob and Alice are communicating

67
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.820 
and in a certain point
in time the attacker

68
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.340 
jumps in by plugging a
message from Alice to Bob

69
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.520 
taking over and continue the
communication as Bob so that Bob

70
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.670 
is not aware that he is no more
communicating with Alice, that

71
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.500 
now he is communicating
with Bob.

72
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.760 
This is a hijacked connection
or an illegal change of state.

73
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.070 
For example Mallory is
able to change the state,

74
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.230 
the state of the communication
process "password not entered"

75
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.930 
into the stage
"password was entered and

76
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.950 
successfully checked".

77
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.060 
So this is another state and in
this state even an unauthorized

78
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.150 
partner Mallory that does
not know the password can

79
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.290 
jump into the
communication.

80
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.220 
Another type of attacks against cryptographic
protocols are traffic flow analysis.

81
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.720 
Sometimes even if the attacker does not
understand the meaning of the messages

82
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.690 
which are exchanged
in an encrypted way.

83
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.510 
Statistical analysis

84
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:04.720 
when were certain messages sent, which
message are encrypted, which message

85
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.190 
is not encrypted, when and to whom
the encrypted messages are sent,

86
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.740 
is there an event connected that then there is a
change from an encrypted to encrypted messages.

87
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.620 
Such observation about a
longer period of the communication

88
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.690 
gives a lot of
information to

89
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.280 
analyzing attacker. For
example if you think on the traffic

90
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.810 
between a state
and the embassy

91
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.400 
in anniversaries, in
an anniversary country.

92
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.200 
And an attack which is
very often applied

93
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.630 
and is not directed to
get information about the

94
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.820 
content of a communication it is
denial of service. Here the idea is

95
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.050 
to completely a prevent the
communication partner from being

96
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.140 
able to exchange messages. So
the idea of this attack is to

97
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.460 
cause a system crash by overloading
the system, so that communication

98
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.830 
does not go on, can
no more happen.

99
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.030 
And this are only a few,

100
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.500 
and these are attacks that are
often applied in many many variations

101
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.830 
but there are more types. We do
not have the time to discuss this.

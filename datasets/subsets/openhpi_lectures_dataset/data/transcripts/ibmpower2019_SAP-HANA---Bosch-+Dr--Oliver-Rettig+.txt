00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.799 
Hello everybody, my name is Oliver Rettig, I'm responsible for driving the enterprise

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.230 
infrastructure strategy at Robert Bosch.

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.309 
I'm relatively new to Robert Bosch.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.349 
I joined Bosch January 2018, coming from

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.739 
system vendors, namely Lenovo.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.179 
I drove the SAP solution development for especially

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.069 
SAP Hana, for Lenovo and before of that, I drove the

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.609 
SAP HANA development for IBM on IBM system fax machine.

9
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.429 
So everything in the world I would want to present

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.079 
to you today the SAP HANA strategy at Robert

11
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.080 
Bosch.

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.240 
With my background coming from the infrastructure, so this will be infrastructure

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.650 
bound.

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.169 
Well, first of all, I would want to look at Robert Bosch overall, what are the

15
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.729 
requirements of Bosch? Why are we looking for an SAP HANA strategy or

16
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.469 
what are the classical SAP systems that we run, especially

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.749 
on IBM Power Platform or Onex 86 systems?

18
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.129 
We're looking at Bosch, just a brief overview, Bosch is

19
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.259 
split into different organizations,

20
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.969 
different groups, the Mobility Solutions Group, which drive 60 percent

21
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.884 
of the revenue, industrial technology

22
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.439 
where Bosch is also one of the market leaders driving manufacturing technologies,

23
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.599 
energy and building technology.

24
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.099 
If you are in a large airport, there is a high probability that this airport,

25
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.079 
the alarm system, the fire alarm, the speaker system

26
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.469 
and things like that are controlled with Bosch technology.

27
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.039 
And then you might be aware of consumer goods like household appliances,

28
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.628 
the do it yourself environment and also for your garden,

29
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.569 
these kind of consumer goods, also smart home devices

30
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.429 
that are relatively new to bosch that fit into the consumer

31
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.929 
goods space. And you might be aware of the e-bikes where Bosch

32
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.329 
is a market leader in the electromobility

33
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.319 
for e-bikes in the drive technologies and control and so forth.

34
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.019 
At this point

35
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.909 
To give you a comprehensive overview,

36
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.069 
I would like to show the following video.

37
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.729 
Please enjoy that video and I will resume thereafter.

38
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.606 
I'll start my day, like a Bosch, sun rays, like a Bosch.

39
00:02:57.775 --> 00:03:00.985 
I tapped the phone when the phone call is on.

40
00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:02.458 
I am along like a Bosch.

41
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.119 
All connected, so effective.

42
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.449 
I let it dry, cleaned it up.

43
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.593 
He did smart, I'll do my part.

44
00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:19.129 
Get in in the car, superstar.

45
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.178 
They're watching me, a IoT.

46
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.959 
I check my stock, what a shot.

47
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.639 
Buy some prawn, my oven's on, coming home

48
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.989 
future song for me

49
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.440 
IoT.

50
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.969 
Live like a Bosch with many connectivity solutions for a

51
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.080 
smarter future.

52
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.744 
From Bosch.

53
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.809 
So what you could recognize there is that Bosch is active in

54
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.699 
different areas. You saw the lawnmower, you saw the smart robot

55
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.419 
cleaning the house, you saw the heating control.

56
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.819 
You saw that the household appliances, like the dishwasher, the coffee maker,

57
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.069 
all these devices are connected.

58
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.779 
And Bosch is looking forward to have every product,

59
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.249 
every device that leaves the Bosch factory will be connected to

60
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.879 
the Internet starting in 2020, which is next year.

61
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.919 
So Bosch has high goals, a high target

62
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.809 
to achieve that. And behind that, you can imagine that there is a backbone

63
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.909 
required to drive all this.

64
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.559 
And we are looking for data security because our customer's

65
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.109 
data are in our best interest.

66
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.089 
And we don't want to see that customer data leak out and drive

67
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.799 
business for other for our competitors or for new companies.

68
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.439 
So that's the driving force behind Bosch coming from

69
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.059 
the old sparkplugs technology driving the automobile

70
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.889 
industry, we will continue to drive the automobile industry, but we are much more

71
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.520 
in the new area like industry for IoT.

72
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.050 
So here I have the latest figures,

73
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.009 
77.9 billions of revenue in 2018

74
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.539 
with four hundred and ten thousand employees, sixty-five

75
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.789 
thousand in research and development and coming from the year 2017

76
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.439 
where we had four hundred and two thousand employees overall and sixty

77
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.069 
two thousand in research and technology in development.

78
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.819 
So you can imagine and you clearly see where's the focus.

79
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.409 
So seven thousand out of eight thousand new associates,

80
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.479 
how we are called as Bosch employees are in research and development

81
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
that joined Bosch in 2018.

82
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.569 
From a market perspective, the market is split.

83
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.939 
We have the Europe sector, which is fifty two percent of our revenue.

84
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.589 
We have Asia Pacific and we have the Americas with North and South

85
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.359 
America with 18 percent. And the rest is Asia Pacific with a lot of factories.

86
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.979 
Two hundred and eighty manufacturing sites overall and a lot of

87
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.749 
warehouses. And all this needs to be controlled and for this, we are using

88
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.920 
SAP technology.

89
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.939 
So I belong to the Central Department of Information

90
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.359 
Systems and Services, we are seven thousand seven hundred

91
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.360 
and fifty employees worldwide.

92
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.079 
We have several data centers in North America, Chicago,

93
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.879 
in Singapore and the main our global data center is in the Stuttgart area

94
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.379 
where we have currently three data centers and we are looking forward

95
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.439 
to add two more data centers.

96
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.979 
Why are these data centers located in the Stuttgart area?

97
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.599 
Well, we started Bosch is traditionally a German company, and we have

98
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.369 
our data center, our first data center was built in Stuttgart and

99
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.164 
due to latencies between data centers and due to

100
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.079 
continuity of the business, business continuity, we need to look

101
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.699 
at high availability and we need to replicate data from

102
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.649 
one system to the other system.

103
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.089 
And the commit from the other system determines the runtime

104
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.959 
and the response time of the actual system.

105
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.609 
So we are latency bound. So we need to have data centers close together.

106
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.169 
That's why we are looking forward to have five data centers in the Stuttgart area.

107
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:10.049 
And then we have a disaster recovery data center, which currently is in Nuremberg,

108
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.250 
where we are 100 kilometers away.

109
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.599 
We are the IT partner within Bosch and

110
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.139 
doing consulting with our colleagues from the different business units.

111
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.579 
What are the latest IT technologies and how can we partner that

112
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.649 
they have their needs and they need to connect their devices

113
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.369 
and we provide the backbone and how do we get that together?

114
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.431 
So we also have a huge IoT

115
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.999 
arm within Bosch. We, for example, have the Bosch software

116
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.469 
innovations based in Berlin, and

117
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.359 
here we partner with the different units within Bosch.

118
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.169 
We provide the IT infrastructure, for example, the SAP

119
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.819 
systems to drive the factories, the warehouses

120
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.890 
and our sales efforts, and we look for

121
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.409 
efficiency and achieving the economies of scale

122
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.269 
with standard solutions. We don't want to deviate or we want to restrict

123
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.869 
deviation from the standards to the bare minimum.

124
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.459 
And the other thing is we need to secure the information

125
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.259 
that belongs to Bosch so that that does not leak out

126
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.819 
to our competitors and that we make sure that our

127
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.379 
end customers data is safe within Robert Bosch

128
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.380 
data centers.

129
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.899 
So now, after this introduction of Robert Bosch, let me

130
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.289 
look at how are we running SAP Systems?

131
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.779 
How many SAP systems do we have.

132
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.819 
So, in the classical environment we are running IBM power systems

133
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.899 
and we are convinced of their advantages, that's why we are doing it.

134
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.069 
We have one hundred and thirty two frames, meaning one hundred and thirty two racks of

135
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.623 
systems running more than fourteen hundred instances of SAP.

136
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.589 
To accelerate the business, we started to implement

137
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.630 
business warehouse accelerators.

138
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.219 
And there we currently are running 10 rack-mounted servers.

139
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.389 
In last year, we replaced one hundred and eleven blade servers with these 10 rack-mount

140
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.859 
servers and we went from 14 terabyte to eight and a half terabytes

141
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.629 
of memory and we save 40 kilowatts of energy consumption

142
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.630 
there.

143
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.469 
Where did these remaining data go?

144
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.269 
We certainly migrated a lot of things into SAP HANA,

145
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.889 
where we are running to islands of power systems, eight

146
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.449 
e880 systems in each island, providing two hundred and fifty six

147
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.799 
terabytes of memory to HANA instances.

148
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.299 
Overall one hundred and eleven HANA instances that are hosted in this

149
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.300 
environment.

150
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.838 
In addition, one of our units, the Bosch Siemens Hausgerate,

151
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.879 
they run a HANA  farm based on x86 systems.

152
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.949 
Traditionally also on blade systems, we just introduced nine

153
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.419 
rack-mounted servers last year and went from thirty six

154
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.399 
terabyte to seventy eight terabyte.

155
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.869 
So we leverage the newer technology to increase

156
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.699 
the capacity that we provide to the business.

157
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.289 
We are also hosting or we are running SAP HANA

158
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.849 
systems in the HANA Enterprise Cloud where we have several

159
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.289 
scale out and scale up systems running our business

160
00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:02.029 
warehouse applications. There we are running forty two terabytes and overall

161
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.509 
that's twenty three HANA instances.

162
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.929 
In the eighty six space it's one hundred and two.

163
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.180 
servers.

164
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.330 
Eighty three servers running, one hundred and two HANA instances.

165
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:25.779 
Well, so that's the overview on the environment that we are running.

166
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.879 
When we look at business continuity, we need to care of high availability

167
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.230 
of our solutions. So when you look at an SAP system, you have the

168
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.989 
the three layers, the presentation layer, the application layer and the database layer

169
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.969 
from an infrastructure perspective, icare of the servers

170
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.439 
and the storage that are required to host the data

171
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.539 
that is actually down. On the presentation layer, we have lots of redundancies.

172
00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.159 
If one of the sub GUIs goes down, we

173
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.369 
have another system to take over.

174
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.719 
If a network port goes down, that can simply be replaced.

175
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.189 
On the application layer, we also have multiple application servers

176
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.429 
distributed across our data centers, different sites.

177
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.049 
So if one of the application servers goes down, the other ones can take the load.

178
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.519 
And if one of the data centers goes down the other data center and the

179
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.959 
application servers data can take the load with performance penalties, but we

180
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.259 
can continue with the business.

181
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.080 
We then have the Oracle database underneath,

182
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.379 
where we do log shipping to the remote data center and we are able

183
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.169 
to restore all the data there.

184
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:50.079 
And when that data center would go down, we would be able to

185
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.699 
recover in the secondary data center and continue to drive the business from there.

186
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.599 
We also ship the logs to the remote data center, which is more than one hundred

187
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.399 
kilometers away for archiving, because when actually

188
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.959 
both data centers in the Stuttgart area or the Stuttgart area would go down,

189
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.639 
we all are can agree that we would have different issues

190
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.999 
than just continuing the business.

191
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.020 
But we have we took care of that.

192
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.769 
On this chart, I picked our largest SAP

193
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:31.299 
system that is driving the mobility solutions with one

194
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.979 
hundred and forty factories connected, two hundred warehouses and seventy

195
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.579 
thousand users connecting to that SAP system.

196
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.499 
We have sales and distribution there.

197
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.649 
We have finance there. We have material management.

198
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.389 
We have logistics. We have production control for some regions

199
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.859 
not overall, but a lot of load onto

200
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.049 
a single SAP system.

201
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.049 
This system comes with 12 application servers

202
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.379 
and it is extremely important that this system keeps

203
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.879 
on running because, you can imagine an hour of downtime

204
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.319 
in 140 factories, they can absorb this

205
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.939 
a bit, but after that, they cannot bring a new material and they

206
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:24.069 
cannot ship products. So it's extremely

207
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.569 
cumbersome to continue business if such a system would go down.

208
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:33.099 
That's why we run the servers also in a redundant

209
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.519 
fashion.

210
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.049 
We have high availability with automatic failover from one E880 server to

211
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.759 
the other E880 server, and we mirror all the data to two storage

212
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.379 
devices. So if a storage device fails, we can continue the business.

213
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.939 
Usually, the presentation layer would not recognize that a server goes down

214
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.359 
or neither that a storage device would go down.

215
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.119 
We also pursue on the storage site with all flash on that system

216
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.399 
because performance is key here.

217
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.940 
With seventy thousand users, you have a lot of load on the system.

218
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.039 
You need to deliver that performance.

219
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.879 
That system consumes the whole server.

220
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.450 
There is no other load on that single server

221
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.169 
and that's extremely important.

222
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:27.729 
And we are looking forward to drive further innovations into that

223
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.479 
system because the business is growing, keeps on growing.

224
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.119 
And with all the discussions on

225
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.869 
electromobility, autonomous driving and new devices,

226
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.320 
that drives a lot of new load into that SAP system.

227
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:52.409 
So looking at the E880 as a server with especially

228
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.949 
in the SAP HANA scope is 400 kg of sheet

229
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:01.093 
metal within a single rack, twenty two you hide units

230
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.469 
we can simply cover that.

231
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.019 
10 kilowatts of power consumption.

232
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.950 
That sounds much, but we can also cover that.

233
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.618 
The only thing is imagine that we have one hundred and thirty two

234
00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:22.809 
of these systems within our data centers, so it accumulates

235
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.199 
and we have about one Megawatt per data center,

236
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.899 
we need to household and keep track

237
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.369 
of how much energy we consume and replace old system with new,

238
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.645 
more efficient systems.

239
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.569 
16 terabytes of memory per frame or

240
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:48.159 
a rack belong to one HANA Island, which makes one hundred

241
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.839 
and twenty eight terabyte per island, and then the secondary island with another

242
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.549 
one hundred twenty eight terabyte of memory for further HANA

243
00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.689 
instances.

244
00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:03.219 
Now HANA instances are deployed in logical

245
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.770 
partitions par on that server system.

246
00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.779 
So we bring in one HANA instance after the other and we look

247
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.979 
for efficiency, that means if we need to squeeze in

248
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:23.119 
a small L par, we are always able to find a spot on that server,

249
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.509 
30 to PCI adapters for a single system.

250
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.799 
And we definitely need that because we need connectivity to the network.

251
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.809 
We need connectivity to the storage, high bandwidth, low latency.

252
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.959 
And that's why we have the one hundred and fifty gigabytes per second of

253
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.069 
I/O bandwidth to to to the storage here.

254
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:51.469 
That's key in the diagram here you see

255
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.149 
the front end connection is going through 10 gigabit Ethernet.

256
00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.799 
We have the server nodes comprising one frame

257
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.640 
and to the storage we communicate through infinity band.

258
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.759 
To a shared storage that we get from

259
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.469 
enterprise storage server, the ESS that is based on

260
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.117 
spectrum scale, formerly known as GPFS.

261
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:25.039 
We boot from a traditional sense and we run our HANA systems,

262
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.090 
single nodes, different sizes, scale-up,

263
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.359 
and also scale-out across these servers in different parts, running everything

264
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360 
in parallel.

265
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.789 
What is key to us is, imagine we currently

266
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.349 
have one hundred and eleven HANA instances running on these two

267
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:52.299 
islands, and we already foresee a growth

268
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.879 
in that perspective that we will see more HANA instances and our customers

269
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.764 
are demanding to get more HANA.

270
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:05.979 
To drive that efficiently, we rely on

271
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.449 
an orchestrator on a deployment to where the customer can choose.

272
00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.529 
Do I want to run a business warehouse or a suite or in the future?

273
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:20.109 
S for Hanaa or BW for Hanah or whatsoever production

274
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:24.909 
or non production, is it a bronze level, just a single instance

275
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.559 
without any replication or in the future, silver, gold, platinum level with

276
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.759 
different levels of replication and high availability measures.

277
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.409 
But that is key. The customer needs to click the submit button and

278
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:42.969 
then the deployment of an HANA instance automatically starts.

279
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:47.679 
The filesystems are defined, the

280
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.449 
L par is defined, the HANA database is installed and the IP addresses

281
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.619 
are provided to the customer who then can attach application servers to the HANA

282
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.239 
database. So that is definitely key for efficiently driving

283
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.260 
such an environment.

284
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:09.219 
From an infrastructure perspective, I explain to you we have 8 E880s

285
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:14.529 
per island, front end connection through 10 gigabit

286
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:19.089 
Ethernet and back and through infinity band

287
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:23.799 
to three parallel elastic storage servers,

288
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.389 
providing all the storage for hosting the persistence

289
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.690 
and logs of HANA system.

290
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.909 
Now, this is what we have today, looking forward, here is what we are looking

291
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:44.099 
for to SAP and IBM, what kind of improvements

292
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.159 
would we appreciate to see in the near future?

293
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.739 
One thing is virtual Ethernet connections so that we

294
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.449 
can use live partition mobility, meaning moving one

295
00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.892 
HANA instance from one server to the other server for

296
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.299 
administration, for

297
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.239 
taking a server down, moving from one island to the other,

298
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.469 
that certainly drives the downtime.

299
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:20.449 
But within a system that we can get as much flexibility

300
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.889 
as required to administrate the infrastructure efficiently, we are

301
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.239 
also looking to replace the 10 gigabit front and network with 40 gigabit.

302
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.139 
We already have that in the data center for Gigabit Infrastructure.

303
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.579 
And for the back end, we are looking to replace infinity band technology

304
00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.010 
with 100 gigabit converged Ethernet.

305
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.509 
What we are definitely looking for is that we get systems larger

306
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:51.309 
than twenty four terabytes scale up, that means going beyond

307
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:56.139 
twenty four terabytes and there are initial deployments

308
00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.759 
outside of Bosch that leverage, up to 48 terabyte within

309
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.679 
a single system. And that's where we are looking at SAP

310
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.209 
to provide that to Bosch as well as our demand

311
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.210 
is growing.

312
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.569 
Running systems, SAP HANA systems scale out

313
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:21.279 
is sometimes recommended because it's the only solution

314
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.379 
available today, but we would prefer to stay within a single server

315
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.839 
as much as we can.

316
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:34.799 
The other thing is we are looking to get online memory

317
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.629 
increase within of an HANA database because our customers

318
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.304 
are growing their business, that means they are growing their database size

319
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.369 
equivalently to growing their business.

320
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:52.649 
And just taking down the HANA database

321
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:57.180 
to allocate more memory and restart a new HANA database,

322
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.999 
that's not the preferred solution that our customers are looking for.

323
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.499 
Because they want to go with the least minimum of downtime.

324
00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:15.329 
We are also looking at nonvolatile memory technologies to

325
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:20.669 
allow accelerated loads of systems wherever possible

326
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:25.469 
and also definitely reduced cost where DRAM memory technology

327
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.969 
has its price, leveraging flash technology on the memory, Bosch has

328
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.029 
an advantage from a cost perspective.

329
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.589 
And why we recognize that some HANA instances are

330
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:42.599 
very active and are requiring some CPU.

331
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.099 
We see that especially in the non production space we

332
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.359 
already share processor resources and we would want to

333
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:58.199 
be able to also share these resources for production instances to

334
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.879 
more efficiently run our HANA

335
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.180 
cloud on different islands.

336
00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:12.270 
So why did Robert Bosch decide to go with IBM power?

337
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.590 
When you look at this chart from IDC,

338
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.180 
this is dated December 2016.

339
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:26.099 
You see that the market share of IBM is in the range of 15 percent and the

340
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.119 
market leader is Cisco with respective number of servers.

341
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.509 
But is that the right measure to count the number of servers?

342
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.009 
And here you see all servers sold for SAP

343
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:46.019 
HNA 2011 until 2016, so that is not

344
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.402 
the market share of new deployments within 2016.

345
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.749 
That's the overall thing.

346
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:56.309 
And while IBM sold their systems business to Lenovo in

347
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.910 
2014, these systems are still counted here.

348
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:07.799 
So looking at the advantages that we see with IBM power, IBM

349
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.269 
power was the first system where SAP allowed to run multiple

350
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:17.489 
production virtual machines in the eighty-sixspace in the beginning

351
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.862 
in the West, a time frame and then also later with IBM, SAP

352
00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.900 
just allowed a single virtual machine per physical server.

353
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:34.409 
Only with VM4 and VM5

354
00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:39.059 
and then later on with 65 and 67 multiple VMs were

355
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.049 
approved by SAP but with restrictions.

356
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:48.719 
On an eight socket system with the latest Skylake processor technology,

357
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.709 
you can run up to 16 virtual machines.

358
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.359 
What is being run in the field what customers run

359
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.829 
is a different story. Do they actually run 16 virtual machines on an

360
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.689 
eight socket system, or is it more the bread and butter system with four

361
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.530 
processor sockets running up to four virtual machines?

362
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:16.909 
That's not up to me to

363
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:21.599 
decide, but given the environment we are running,

364
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.899 
this is something that I observe.

365
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.759 
We also appreciate that IBM Power was the first to provide

366
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.199 
business warehouse scaleup with 16 terabytes in a completely

367
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.789 
virtualizing environment. Also the business we did as for HANA, we can

368
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.829 
scale up to twenty-fourterabyte within that server virtual environment.

369
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.679 
That means we want to move these.

370
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.629 
It would take time, yes.

371
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:53.429 
But we get some flexibility running in a virtualised

372
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:58.169 
environment with L Parse. And if we can increase and change the size of

373
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.839 
the L parse, that would be very beneficial.

374
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.369 
And we appreciate that iBM received a prestigious SAP Pinnacle

375
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:10.229 
Award for such infrastructure innovation in twenty eighteen.

376
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:15.329 
Now with these advantages, if I do not compare the number of servers,

377
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.279 
if I just take that to 2016 numbers of

378
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.809 
how many servers are deployed and look at under the assumption we

379
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:28.559 
are running four virtual machines per server.

380
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.689 
And what I see is a logical partitions within an IBM power server.

381
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.650 
I see IBM as the market leader in the SAP HANA space.

382
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.339 
And these are the numbers that I take out of our environment

383
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.139 
and the responses from other customers running x86 or IBM

384
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.149 
power servers. So and given the fact that

385
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.919 
SAP HANA was announced and generally available in 2011

386
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.599 
and IBM entered the market in 2015, this is

387
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.369 
really impressive that IBM gained this market share just

388
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.849 
2015 going into 2016.

389
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.799 
I would love to see a new comparison with latest numbers of twenty eighteen,

390
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.779 
but then not on the number of servers, but on the number of actual

391
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.670 
HANA instances customers are on.

392
00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:31.419 
So in summary, what are the leadership features we see with IBM power,

393
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.529 
we rely on that deployment tool.

394
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:38.169 
This is based on open stack that makes it easy to provide

395
00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:43.719 
that service to our customers, our Bosch internal customers running HANA databases.

396
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.609 
We appreciate the virtualization and the shared pool technology we get from

397
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.750 
IBM power with all its flexibility and scalability.

398
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.979 
That makes it efficient for us to run such an environment.

399
00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.509 
We appreciate the technology, whereas, well, we take it for given

400
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.039 
the only thing we care of is runtime response

401
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.809 
time and capacity we have.

402
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.719 
So that's key for running such an environment.

403
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.219 
And what we see is that, for example, the memory bandwidth IBM power system

404
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.019 
is almost double the memory bandwidth in an X86 system

405
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.609 
and 8 way hyperthreading in IBM power compared to

406
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.155 
two way hyperthreading in X86, we

407
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.349 
appreciate that advantage and we just take it.

408
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.249 
Also, from a connectivity perspective, PCI version four is already

409
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.779 
supported with power eight and also power nine

410
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.939 
versus in the eighty six world PCI version three

411
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.679 
will stay until 2020 when maybe

412
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.269 
Intel will introduce PCI generation four with

413
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.669 
a new processor technology.

414
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:07.619 
Why is that key? Imagine our 100 gigabit

415
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:13.139 
connectivity we used to import adapters if you are in the PCIE

416
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.769 
world, generation three, you run one port

417
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:22.629 
with one hundred gigabit full speed and then the other port is starving because

418
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.829 
you cannot get more than 10 or 20 gigabit out of that secondary port.

419
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:31.749 
With PCIE generation 4 you can drive 200 gigabit connections

420
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.759 
out of that cart.

421
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.319 
And then everything virtualize, running from small development instances.,

422
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.299 
64 gigabyte or even 32 gigabyte would be possible up to 24

423
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.379 
terabytes from and from a single instance.

424
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.751 
That's actually what we appreciate with the IBM power platform driving SAP HANA.

425
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.919 
So overall, thanks for that, thanks for your attention, and I

426
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.389 
hope I could provide some valuable insights into what Bosch is

427
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.180 
doing with SAP HANA, and IBM power.

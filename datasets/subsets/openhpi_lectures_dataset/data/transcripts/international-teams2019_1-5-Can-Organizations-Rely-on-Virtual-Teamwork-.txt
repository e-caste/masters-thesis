1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.270 
So nowadays, people have been using,
or have been relying heavily

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.570 
on new technologies and they
have been using online tools,

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.430 
which Tom will be presenting
later in the upcoming weeks,

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.850 
they are working actually
virtually, right?

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.280 
But the question is, can organizations
rely on virtual teams?

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.600 
It's a good question Hanadi,
because relying on teamwork

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.960 
just in a normal office is already
difficult, now when you put it in

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.430 
a new dimension, remote team work, it is something that the organization
needs to consider, because there are several aspects that also are

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.350 
involved in this new, let's
say, working environment.

10
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.450 
In the past several organizations,
very big ones, you can see

11
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610 
Yahoo, Hewlett-Packard, they
failed implementing this kind of

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.290 
policies. They failed because they
didn't have enough control,

13
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.020 
they didn't have the proper communication.
But anyways there are also

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.640 
organizations, where things really
worked. When you consider

15
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.290 
examples from, for
instance, IBM or Oracle,

16
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.740 
they have a big amount of people
working outside, working remotely,

17
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.340 
with really dynamic times.
They are working around the

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.510 
globe and they synchronize their
tasks and their work pretty well.

19
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.120 
The one thing is, that we cannot
expect, just because we now

20
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.080 
have internet-then we bring people
outside and start working.

21
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.510 
No, this is really a big mistake.
Just for the normal working

22
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.710 
office, it took a long
time to bring the office

23
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.420 
to work, now that we want
to bring things outside,

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.020 
we need to consider not just technology but
also there are several other aspects.

25
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.150 
Some of these aspects, we
are going to talk about.

26
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.340 
But the first thing I
want to mention is that

27
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.510 
we need to implement a culture, it
is a change, it is a new chip

28
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.940 
that we need to bring in. ...
What do you mean by culture?

29
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.460 
Is the background of the ...no it
is a new working style, it is

30
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.180 
a new type of interaction, a
new type of work, new type of

31
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.390 
getting things organized.
It has nothing to do

32
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.860 
with cultural differences
between countries or so.

33
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.050 
No, it's a cultural
change in the way how

34
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.290 
we work, and for that it is also
necessary to consider there

35
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.230 
are some kinds of personalities
that we definitely need to

36
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.700 
care about, because not everyone
is ready for working remotely.

37
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.450 
And I say not ready yet, but you
can get there by training, to get

38
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.820 
into that point. And we need
also to consider that not only

39
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.200 
necessarily it is a person,
who has a problem to bring

40
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.220 
his experience outside,
to the remote work,

41
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.320 
but also it is also necessary to
identify, which are the job skills

42
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.640 
required for doing this job,
and also which experience is

43
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.620 
related to the people. We
cannot intend that people who

44
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.410 
just got out from the university
and now let us bring them to work

45
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.520 
at home or to work remotely if
they have not any experience

46
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.960 
in interacting with people.
Also it is important

47
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.360 
that when we bring in this new
lifestyle and this working

48
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.060 
style, it also is necessary to consider
the experience that the people

49
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.400 
have already. Because, if
people need to get trained,

50
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.100 
this training should
happen better

51
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.980 
face-to-face. You will see that it's very
difficult to replace the interaction in

52
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.980 
face-to-face meetings with a video
or with teleconferences, or stuff

53
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.530 
like that. It means, it
should be a process

54
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.070 
it cannot happen at once, it will
take probably days, weeks, months,

55
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.930 
or even years in order to
happen properly, but

56
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.980 
we cannot ignore that experience
plays also a role in the remote

57
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.840 
work. It is something
relevant,

58
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.200 
it also has something to do with
the self discipline that people

59
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.670 
need to have. Self-discipline
means that I can

60
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.930 
do my job that i am assigned to
do, but also I need to consider

61
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.290 
that there are more people out
there that are depending on

62
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.950 
my work. It means this change that
comes with working outside, it

63
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.050 
needs to be also as well synchronized
and this synchronization

64
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.890 
will depend a lot on my performance
on what I do and what I

65
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.540 
say. I am committed to do something,
if something fails there

66
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.330 
then the change and the product
at the end it will not be as

67
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.960 
expected and of course
the whole process

68
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.310 
will fail. So the personality of
the worker is really important...

69
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.110 
It is relevant and it has
to be considered. Many

70
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.310 
organizations, they
just think that they

71
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.650 
provide a laptop and they provide
a high speed connection and then

72
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.820 
things are done. No, no, no,
it is necessary to consider

73
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.370 
all these little aspects.
And also we cannot expect

74
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.720 
that the organization will give me
the motivation to work remotely.

75
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.090 
Now if you are not ok
with working remotely,

76
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.650 
potentially, then you can say "ok,
i don't want to work remotely

77
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.170 
the whole time, I want to work
remotely part-time."

78
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.460 
This is also fair for
for the organization.

79
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.580 
The point is: do not expect
motivation from the organization.

80
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.070 
Your motivation for working remotely,
it will come from within you,

81
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.570 
And also that there is
a commitment from the

82
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.790 
organization in bringing the team
leaders also out there, in

83
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.910 
order to have, them experiencing
first hand of what is going

84
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.910 
on there. And then we were going to
talk about also that feedbacks

85
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.180 
are extremely important
in recognising what is

86
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.060 
working very good and what
is working not so good.

87
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.040 
But for that we need a
good communication there

88
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.440 
in that regard. Also
it is important to

89
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.140 
talk about the work personalities.
People need to be

90
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.710 
flexible. Things are
not going to happen

91
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.430 
like normally, happening in normal
offices, where everything

92
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.280 
we know: this is my space,
these are the working times.

93
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.270 
No! Things start changing, because
my space will be a space probably

94
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.930 
today in one place, tomorrow in
another place, and also the working

95
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.150 
times will change. We need to
be careful as well, because

96
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.860 
there is no 'I will not work more
than eight hours or less than

97
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.780 
eight hours'. To develop a
feeling for this flexibility

98
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.600 
is important for the team
leaders, for the managers,

99
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.210 
and also for the employees.
It is very very relevant.

100
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.570 
And people need to bring a
kind of innovativeness

101
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.090 
that means things are gonna change
and if people are not ready

102
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.880 
to change, because you will find
profiles in an organization that say:

103
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.410 
'No clearly, I don't want to move',
and if this innovativeness

104
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.330 
is not there, it will be difficult
to force people to do something

105
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.490 
that the organization wants. You to
need to start agreeing on this,

106
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.010 
step-by-step and what you went to
achieve, who is going to take part

107
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.130 
in this program. Very very very
important don't hide the program

108
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.820 
from other people. Open clearly,
talk openly about this topic,

109
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.740 
because if you start making this kind
of ghettos in the organization

110
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.180 
then you have a privilege to
work remotely. The others

111
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.170 
they don't have that.
No. Make clear

112
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.030 
that you have, before you communicate
it to the people, that you have,

113
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.690 
let's say, a policy defined by
yourself or the organization,

114
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.310 
when you communicate
everything to everyone.

115
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.150 
You will save a lot of
time, a lot of problems.

116
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.040 
Hidden information, hidden
communication, it is not good at all.

117
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.380 
Yeah, but at the same time it
also depends on the nature or

118
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.640 
the type of work, the worker
will be doing, because some

119
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.230 
types of work might work
remotely but for other types

120
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.670 
of work it may not work. ... And
there are some that are definitely

121
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.430 
not recommended, for instance,
when you require some kind of

122
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:23.220 
a specific equipment. Sorry
you cannot bring a device

123
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.640 
home to work remotely. There
are some considerations, we

124
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.310 
will talk in more detail
about this in some

125
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.830 
of the next videos. But this is
very important the personality

126
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.580 
also has to do with the
life-cycle. I mean,

127
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.330 
let's say, you have people graduated
from the universities twenty,

128
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.050 
twenty-five, thirtys, and
people retiring sixty-five

129
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.840 
in that age. Take care
that the people,

130
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.190 
the new people coming out,
they want social contact.

131
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.530 
Most of them, not all of them.
But consider the people in the

132
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.940 
the lifestyle what they currently
have. Probably, they are

133
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.950 
not focusing on 'I want to
work remotely permanently',

134
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.910 
or potentially yes, but consider
that the different ages they

135
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.050 
also have an impact it is
willing. For instance

136
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.070 
parents that just
got a kid, for

137
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.860 
them it will really provide
flexibility. For them it will

138
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.980 
be by far more an adequate
to start working remotely.

139
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.760 
For people that are older,
that do not want

140
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.790 
to get into the traffic
permanently, for them it

141
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.700 
will also be okay. Consider that the
life cycle stages are also relevant

142
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.250 
in this. And it's also because of
socialization, socialization is a ...

143
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.570 
I was about to ask you, how to
overcome this socialization

144
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.470 
factor? Because I know, it's very
important for some people. They

145
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.640 
don't want to be separated from their
surroundings or their colleagues? ...

146
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.110 
Many people rely on the
coffee in the kitchen

147
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.270 
in the office, to go to have
lunch, or things like that.

148
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.280 
For other people this is completely
not relevant. They prefer

149
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.190 
to have at home their own
hamburger, or whatever they have.

150
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.280 
But socialization is one of
the topics that what we will

151
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.800 
see, in the next videos with Tom:
communication will play a role

152
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.360 
in this socialization, and for
this communication there are

153
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.660 
several tools that will support
this, there be videos or chats

154
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.220 
But I must be honest, there
is nothing comparable to

155
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.990 
talking to people face-to-face.
It still is the best way.

156
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.150 
This is the way more emotions and
expressions can be transmitted,

157
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.620 
even knowledge can be
transmitted with with a

158
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.300 
face to face communication
and this is very important.

159
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.480 
Socialization is an important topic,
as an organization you need

160
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.070 
to make sure that people are not
feeling alone or getting lost.

161
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.550 
Ambiguity will be also an
issue that we will need to

162
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:46.350 
address. But don't exclude the
human part of this process. This

163
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.170 
is human you're talking to humans
outside and they have feelings.

164
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.180 
Socialization plays a very big
role. OK, thank you very much

165
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.110 
Salim, and now we would
like to hear from you.

166
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.130 
What might be other reasons,
why you would consider

167
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.590 
or not consider a virtual
team to be reliable?

168
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.280 
Have you worked in virtual teams
before? Please share with

169
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.160 
us: your experience, what challenges
you faced, how did you overcome

170
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.200 
the socialization factor for
example? Or if you have any other

171
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.400 
things to talk about, any questions,
any comments. Please feel

172
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.430 
free to join the discussion and post
them in the discussion forum.

173
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.290 
Thank you Salim.
Thank you Hanadi.

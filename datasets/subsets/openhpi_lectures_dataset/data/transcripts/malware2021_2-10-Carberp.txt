00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.730 
In our openHPI course about
Cyber Threats by Malware,

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.990 
now let's speak about another dangerous
malware, let's speak about "Carberp".

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.390 
Carberp is an example of a
complex and dangerous malware

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.490 
which was first
discovered in 2009

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.020 
and the idea behind is to
steal banking credentials

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.730 
to siphon off millions of dollars
from the bank accounts.

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.270 
Almost exclusively in Russian
speaking nature nations

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.820 
this model became
popular and dangerous.

9
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.690 
It spread out by hacking
and creating bookmarks

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.070 
of the malware on popular
and publishing sites.

11
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.660 
So, as the people downloaded
it and it, the Carberp

12
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.870 
records user's keystrokes and spoofs
websites that copy themselves

13
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.340 
to locations that do not require
administrator privilege.

14
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.530 
So, it is a keylogger
plus spoofing attack.

15
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.830 
the Carberp could eliminate other
malware and anti-virus programs

16
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.720 
already running on the infected
system by installing additional

17
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.900 
programs onto the system and this
is a type a trojan type malware.

18
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.210 
How does it work,
this Carberp?

19
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.410 
So, the user, the victim tries
to log in on a banking server,

20
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.960 
on a legitimate banking server, on
his/her online banking and he/she does

21
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.240 
it by means of his/her
user name and password.

22
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:59.710 
Carberp that's installed on the victim's
computer system modifies the legitimate

23
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.840 
online banking website by a malicious online banking
website, this is his/her online bank and so

24
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.370 
the log-in message

25
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.510 
is no longer sent to the legitimate bank server, it
is sent to the malicious attackers' bank server

26
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.380 
and of course, a user types in a username
and password and this is now become known

27
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.780 
to the attacker.

28
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.830 
So, the victim

29
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.020 
is not aware that he/she is sending his/her
banking credentials to the cybercriminals'

30
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.380 
a malicious online bank server
and not to the regular one.

31
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.470 
And then the cybercriminals can log in to
the bank, to the legitimate online bank

32
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.210 
by misusing the account
data of the user,

33
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.230 
and they can order and can
transfer money. In this way they

34
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.840 
create huge damage for many many
users who were attacked by this

35
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.690 
Carberp malware.

36
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.370 
Carberp modifies the online banking
webpage on the fly to trick users

37
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.850 
to download fake mobile banking
applications, so this is a

38
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.500 
type of a phishing
attack. Then,

39
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.030 
if this is successful it allows
Carberp to send the money

40
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.660 
to cybercriminals bank accounts undetected by
capturing transfer authentication numbers -

41
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.070 
TAN, necessary to authorize a
money transfer. So, this is a

42
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.190 
"Man-in-the-Middle" attack,
you see this is such a

43
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.040 
malicious website and it worked
in the Russian speaking world.

44
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.610 
So, Carberp's source code
was leaked online in 2013.

45
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.140 
So, later on, it was
sold for $50.000

46
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.580 
before it got leaked and anyone
could rent the malware service

47
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.830 
ranged from $2.000 up
to $10.000 per month.

48
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.320 
So, the business is
not only used by the

49
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.520 
designer of the attack,
the designer

50
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.010 
they use this malware and rent
attacks to anyone who is paying

51
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.520 
what they want
to get for it.

52
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.020 
So, since that time Carberp has
infected around 150.000 PCs

53
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.630 
in Australia between
2012 and 2013.

54
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.720 
It has been used as a
foundation for a Carbanak

55
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.740 
back door - another malware and
meanwhile there are available and

56
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.860 
in place multiple derivative
malware. So, you see

57
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.120 
malware and the attacks based on
malware are developing very fast,

58
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.460 
if someone detects then it's
modified in another way.

59
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.990 
So, one needs to be really careful
and this is the aim of our course

60
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.100 
to sensitize you so that you with
the many digital information

61
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:43.190 
you get by email or in other sources, you
every time have in mind that if you

62
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.830 
do not know the source of a message or if you do
not know who is responsible for that website,

63
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.530 
be aware that it could be a malicious
email, could be a malicious

64
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.740 
message, could be a malicious
website with a goal to

65
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.080 
perform an attack by
malware on your system.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.470 
In our openHPI course "Blockchain:
Revealing the Myth",

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.500 
we now consider a third component
of the bitcoin system which

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.690 
is about networks incentives
and mining of new bitcoins.

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.340 
What we have so far is we know that
we have our peer to peer network

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.970 
with anonymous users who broadcast
all transactions

6
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.760 
theirs and those they
receive from other users.

7
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.350 
Llet's have a
closer look on the steps

8
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.190 
that are done to
run our network.

9
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.040 
First a new transaction
is created by a user and

10
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.210 
transactions that's received
from other users are broadcast

11
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.710 
to all other users.

12
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.450 
Each user collects new
transactions into a block.

13
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.890 
Each user works on finding a difficult
proof of work for its block.

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.520 
When a user finds
a proof of work

15
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.560 
it broadcasts the block
to all other users,

16
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.200 
we have discussed how
this works in detail.

17
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.050 
Then the other users accept the
block the new block only if

18
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.530 
all transaction in
it are valid

19
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.510 
and not already spent.

20
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.130 
Then the users express their
acceptance of the block

21
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.820 
by working on creating the
next block in the chain

22
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.640 
using the hash of the accepted
block as the previous hash

23
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.040 
into coming into
the new block.

24
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.810 
And then the decision

25
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.310 
if such a chain is
forking the decision

26
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.820 
with which forks the
user continue to work

27
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.830 
is a decision to take
the longest chain

28
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:16.570 
to be the correct one and a valid one
and that it will keep working

29
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.980 
and extended.

30
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.150 
Now messages - messages this
can be transactions,

31
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.100 
but it can also be blocks, are
broadcasted on the best afford basis

32
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.520 
best afford like as a way in
hour the internet is working.

33
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.630 
There is no acknowledgement, it
is broadcast it is assumed the

34
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.500 
work as a network works well, so
that the users really receive

35
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.870 
a message and even if they do
not receive a message, they

36
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.130 
can continue to take part in the
interaction in the network.

37
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.300 
So another is that the user
can at any time leave

38
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.620 
the network or can come
back to rejoin the network

39
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.570 
and to have this
common understanding

40
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.660 
the user decide to accept the longest
proof of work chain as the proof

41
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.970 
what happened while
they were gone.

42
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
So in this longest proof of chain
the most work is invested,

43
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.260 
this is the chain that's considered
to be true by all the users,

44
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.440 
by all the participants
in the network.

45
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.990 
New transaction broadcasts do not
necessarily need to reach all users.

46
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.610 
The system
nevertheless works

47
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.930 
as long as the message
reach many users,

48
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.210 
they will get and find
their way into

49
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.770 
a block so that even
if you those newcomers

50
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.780 
join the network or people that come back
or that people that did not receive

51
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.090 
this information can

52
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.610 
continue to work with this
longest block chain.

53
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.380 
And if an user does
not receive a block

54
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.370 
it will require it when it receives
the next block he finds out

55
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.810 
the previous block is missing and
then he asked other members

56
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.860 
in the peer to
peer network

57
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.070 
to send him this
previous block.

58
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.230 
So in this way all the participants
in the networks in the

59
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.190 
network in the bitcoin network
are on the same status, the same

60
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.860 
order of transactions
can check whether

61
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.430 
future transactions are valid or not.

62
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.930 
Now let's look at what
brings the user

63
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.390 
to invest this proof of work, to
invest this huge computational power

64
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.520 
to produce a new block.

65
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.630 
So this inspection of our
network has once again made

66
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.090 
us aware that we need

67
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.930 
something to incentive the user
because there is no central authority

68
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.590 
there is no third party
that can rule the network.

69
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.430 
So the measures like the work of
proof against fraud are being taken,

70
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.510 
but we still see no significant
reason so far why our users should

71
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.310 
invest so much work
simply to let the system,

72
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.780 
hold the system stable and
let it run as it's assumed.

73
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.880 
This huge amount of
computational power, needs

74
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.140 
access to CPU power, needs
a lot of electricity

75
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.880 
to run the CPU, so why the users
are motivated to do this?

76
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.030 
Since we want to have an electronic cash
system that is independent of third parties.

77
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.800 
We need still such a peer to peer
mind to issue the new currency

78
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.180 
and this is what at the end
brings incentives also to the

79
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.750 
users, incentives that are
given by newly minted coins.

80
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.780 
What is needed is to reward
users for doing work

81
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.220 
with newly minted coins

82
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.220 
and such incentives for users that
support the network and the network

83
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.590 
the run of the network in the
right way provides a way to

84
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.530 
initially distribute coins among users
and bring them into circulation.

85
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.820 
To steady addition of a
constant amount of new coins is

86
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.940 
analogous to gold miners
expanding resources

87
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:23.260 
to add new gold to circulation. In our case
it is CPU time and it's electricity

88
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:30.320 
that it's expanded so with each new
block a certain amount of

89
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:39.250 
new coins of new mints are
produced and were brought into the

90
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:46.730 
circulation. And this is the
incentive, this can also be funded

91
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.120 
with another source and these
are the transaction fees.

92
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.990 
So in the process of performing the
process of work and generating

93
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.170 
new coins is compared with that
of extracting raw materials

94
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:08.530 
when speaks of mining,
mining is synonymous.

95
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:14.560 
Correspondingly a user who performs a
proof of work and creates new blocks

96
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:21.450 
is called a miner in this analogy.
Whoever mines carries out hard work

97
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.940 
to get the desired material in
the case of this cryptocurrency

98
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.590 
the mining is the new bitcoins,

99
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.310 
in the real world it's
mining gold or others.

100
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.690 
How this works in
detail we consider

101
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:48.960 
in more detail in the next clip. Here we
see that greedy attackers ought to find

102
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.860 
it more profitable to play by the
rules since the rules favour

103
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.820 
him while potentially bringing more
new coins than everyone else.

104
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.570 
So this incentive is a reason
but there is also another reason,

105
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:11.170 
a reason that the rules stabilize
the system. And the user has

106
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:18.010 
own currency, has own bitcoins
in the system so the rules

107
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.620 
stables the system and
with it the validity of

108
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.160 
the users own wealth.

109
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.910 
How this is done with the
internet, we will speak

110
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.130 
in the next clip. Here we saw that
producing in the course of

111
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.960 
producing a new block

112
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.960 
the user can earn new

113
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.730 
bitcoins.

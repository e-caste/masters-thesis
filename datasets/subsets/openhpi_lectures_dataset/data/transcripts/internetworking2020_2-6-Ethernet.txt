1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.830 
In our OpenHPI course: A Half Century of
Internet, we now consider the Ethernet

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.770 
the most essential
LAN technology

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.780 
originally Ethernet was
based on a bus topology

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.710 
it was developed in the early
seventies last century, at Xerox

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.840 
PARC by a Metcalfe
and Boggs.

6
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.600 
and these are the basic
competence of an Ethernet

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.130 
on the one side we have
sophistical media

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
the carrier media, this is the
Ethernet cable or only called Ether

9
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.110 
then a second basic component is
a set of rules set of rules for

10
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.260 
how to deal with concurrent access
to the transmission media

11
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.280 
and these are the
CSMA /CD ruleset

12
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.130 
and the third basic component is
a format of the data records

13
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.780 
to be sent to data packets. These are in
that context called Ethernet frames.

14
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.680 
Have a closer look at each
of these basic principles

15
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.360 


16
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.080 
Data packets are sent via
the Ethernet cable,

17
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.030 
so here we have the connecting cable,
each of the systems is connected

18
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:36.120 
and when the sender here will send an
information to a receiver then the package

19
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.150 
is broadcasted to all the systems
that are connected to the Ethernet.

20
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.200 
This was the typical principle
of a local area network,

21
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.310 
here in that case along
with the Ethernet cable

22
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.180 
the data package is sent to
all the connected computers.

23
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.970 
The receiver sees that the package was addressed
to him, so receiver processes the package.

24
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.940 
All the other computers that received
the network interface card detect

25
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.460 
that this package was not for the
computer so it's discarded.

26
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.310 
A few rules about the
CSMA/CD mechanism-

27
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.630 
The Ethernet multiple
access algorithm:

28
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.840 
CSMA is Carrier Sense
Multiple Access,

29
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.450 
CD is collision detection. This
is the problem if there is

30
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.240 
broadcast on one cable, the data packages
are broadcast along this one cable,

31
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.020 
the error can be collisions. So the
question is how to direct them and

32
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.350 
it is not allowed for a participant
of the network to start

33
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.040 
to send his package if there is a
package sent to the computer.

34
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.400 
So when a computer sent a package,
it's a broadcast mechanism.

35
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.850 
It is received by all the
connected computers.

36
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.820 
so at any time, only one package can be
transmitted over an Ethernet cable.

37
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.760 
If there are two package cables then the signals
will interfere and destroy each other.

38
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.400 
So collision will occur and
the electrical signals

39
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.070 
will be a super imposed
or destroyed.

40
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.840 
With this CSMA/CD
mechanism, this

41
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.290 
is successfully
regulated.

42
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.820 
So concurrent send access of the
computers and collision resolution are

43
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.330 
prevented or are dealt with
this CSMA/CD ruleset.

44
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.910 
This ruleset consists

45
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.550 
as a basic rule the
Carrier Sensing.

46
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.700 
It says a computer
listens to the medium,

47
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.620 
to the Ethernet cable
before it sends data.

48
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.640 
As long as there are other data
transferred along this Ethernet cable,

49
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.080 
computer is not allowed
to send a package.

50
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.980 
so if the media, if the
Ethernet is occupied,

51
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.520 
computer has to wait for a
random period of time. It is a

52
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.320 
mechanism with a bit off time
to give him time till when

53
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.940 
he sees that there is some
traffic on the cable, then he

54
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.900 
has to wait and then he
has to soon perform

55
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.580 
carrier sensing and if it's free
then he can send and if not

56
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.440 
then he has to wait
till the next time.

57
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.170 
And the other is what happens if
a very far distance computer

58
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.100 
listens to the cable and does not
realize that there is any cable

59
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.880 
it looks like the cable is free
and it simultaneously starts.

60
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.280 
So after a while say a
collision is detected

61
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:34.960 
and the signals start to destroy
each other, so computers have to

62
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.350 
listen for such collisions and
if a collision has occurred

63
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.700 
the transmission is aborted and a
so-called JAM signal is sent.

64
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.620 
More details you can
find in our materials.

65
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.120 
So the Ethernet offers a
connectionless service, that means

66
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.790 
two communication partners do
not have their own connection.

67
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:08.080 
There are many computers connected
and they all try the best way

68
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:16.380 
to care for communication. So the Ethernet
provides a non-reliable service.

69
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.080 
It's not guaranteed that it works fine,
it could come to a collision and then

70
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.290 
a retransmission
is necessary.

71
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.180 
So the data packets include
a checksum but after those

72
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.350 
at the receiver can see whether
there are some of the signals

73
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:44.840 
was destroyed during the transport, but
there is no acknowledgement mechanism

74
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.640 
so that the receiver sends
back and acknowledges to the

75
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.910 
sender to say yes I got your
packet in a right away.

76
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.860 
This is in this way a non-reliable
service when we need it,

77
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.420 
and of course when send e-mail or
when we want to see websites,

78
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.640 
we need such kind of service, then
this acknowledgement mechanism

79
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.470 
has to be provided on the higher layer
to take care of troubleshooting.

80
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.420 
The third basic of the internet was the
format of such Ethernet data packets

81
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.310 
or an Ethernet frame.

82
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:30.550 
The data packet format is for the various
different Ethernet technologies

83
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:37.430 
that occur over time. In principle, every
time is the same, it starts with a preamble

84
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.230 
then an SFD area, the destination
address, the source address

85
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.940 
the length of the package, and then the data
which need to be transported, and then

86
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.900 
the checksum mechanism.

87
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.440 
So the Preamble is needed to tell
the other computers connected

88
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.940 
to the cable that now a
data transmission starts.

89
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.650 
So the Preamble is 7
or 8 bytes long.

90
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.460 
The 7 bytes start with
such a sequence-101010

91
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:20.140 
to make clear for waking up a
receiver and for synchronizing

92
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.170 
all the computers so that they interpret
the sequence as a transmitted

93
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.400 
signal sequence in
the same way.

94
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.760 
And the last byte of the
Preamble ends with 10101011

95
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:41.450 
and this indicates that now
the actual packet starts.

96
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.290 
This is the SFD- Start
Frame Delimiter.

97
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.490 
then we have the destination
and the source addresses

98
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.910 
as a package which makes clear who
is the sender of the package

99
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.590 
and who is the
receiver.

100
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.220 
We have a type field length here
which in the device packet

101
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.040 
as a packet of the Ethernet protocol
and then we have the data

102
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.200 
that we want to be transmitted
with such a checksum.

103
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.490 
CRC number as checksum.

104
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.680 
What is a Collision
Domain?

105
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.430 
The collision domain is a broadcast
domain. A broadcast domain is when

106
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.310 
one sender sends the package and all the
computer systems that are connected

107
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.960 
to this cable are the receivers
of this broadcast package.

108
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:47.290 
So all hosts in the network that can
receive the package by a broadcast,

109
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.020 
such broadcast domain, within
such a broadcast domain

110
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.760 
there can be a
collision.

111
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:01.940 
So a collision domain is when all hosts that could
have a collision when sending simultaneously.

112
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.110 
So now we speak about an Ethernet
segment and an Ethernet segment

113
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.270 
consists of a group of hosts
connected via an Ethernet cable.

114
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.910 
Such an Ethernet segment is a
collision domain, because here

115
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:25.710 
the broadcast message mechanism leads to the
effect that when different systems start

116
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.070 
the transmission, then there will
be such a collision occurring.

117
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:39.940 
What are the hardware components
needed for such an Ethernet?

118
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:47.070 
we have the Ethernet segment as a first
hardware component, it is a cable.

119
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:52.540 
The systems are connected
to the cable.

120
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.540 
Then we have the
Repeaters,

121
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.750 
which are connected in
individual segments

122
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:05.350 
to build a larger network that operates
as a singer collision domain.

123
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.310 
You remember the longer the cable
the weaker is the signal,

124
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.140 
so a receiver is used to amplify
and so we can prolong a system.

125
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:22.430 
Then we have Bridges to connect various
physically separate collision domains

126
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.710 
in which parallel
communication is possible.

127
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.730 
Then we have
the Switches,

128
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:35.530 
to forward packets to the target segments
of the LAN via the corresponding port.

129
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.010 
So switches can connect
different Ethernet

130
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:46.080 
segments and can realize ok ok this
package should be sent to a computer

131
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.800 
in the neighbouring collision
domain in the neighbouring

132
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:57.700 
Ethernet segment and then the
Switch are sending this out

133
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:02.340 
in this other transmission, in
this other Ethernet segment.

134
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:09.140 
Then we have Router, which are necessary
when there are crossings with different

135
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:15.660 
Ethernet LANs, to compute
to which LAN of these

136
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.980 
interconnected LAN this is
packet should be forwarded.

137
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.590 
A short look at the history of
this Ethernet, because its

138
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.870 
long history you remember, it was it
developed in the 70's last century,

139
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.770 
so fifty years ago and in that time of course
computer technology, network technology

140
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.270 
has developed very fast. So the Ethernet
types, different Ethernet types

141
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.590 
differ in terms of
the medium used,

142
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.940 
there are different cablse: coaxial
cables, twisted pair, fiber optic cable.

143
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.200 
There are limiting parameters which
are changing, such as the number

144
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.930 
of connectable computers, the
bandwidth, the topology.

145
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:06.860 
So a milestone in this
development was 1980 wherein

146
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:14.190 
10 MBit per second
Ethernet version was,

147
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.330 
was offered.

148
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:23.070 
Then in 1995, 15 years later,
then already a 100 MBit

149
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:30.310 
per second fast Ethernet came
to the market. The bandwidth,

150
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:36.250 
the number of bits that can be sent
in a second of course it shows the

151
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:43.280 
power of this Ethernet. Then
in 1999 the first 1 GBit

152
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:48.810 
per second Ethernet, the GigaBit Ethernet
came to the market. Originally

153
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:55.390 
it was used as a backbone technology, today
it's also used in Local Area Networks.

154
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.540 
Then the beginning of this century
2001, 10 GigaBits per second

155
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:07.580 
Ethernet came to the market,
used in a Metropolitean

156
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.670 
Area Network and in WAN. You see
in shorter and shorter time

157
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:18.260 
the amount of information that
should be a transferred or such an

158
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:24.330 
network was exploding.
2014, then the first

159
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:29.770 
2.5 GigaBits per second and 5
Gigabit per second Ethernet came,

160
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.910 
they came with cheaper
cabling and hardware

161
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.240 
the Power Over Ethernet (PoE) was
possible. So order through transmission.

162
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.780 
system was changed.

163
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:48.550 
So if we look to the most
successful computer network

164
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.450 
technology world-wide, if we look
to the Ethernet in a nutshell,

165
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:58.930 
Then Ethernet can connect several
hundred computers within a

166
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:06.260 
radius of about 1 kilometer. There
are relatively high data rates.

167
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:13.650 
A low delay due to the omission of any
kind of memory and transport logic

168
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.400 
with this broadcast,
thus is very fast

169
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.370 
This is a simple mechanism,
simple algorithms for accessing

170
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:29.890 
transmission medias, as were the a
rules we discussed. An efficient

171
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.940 
use and fair access to
the network for all the

172
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.580 
computers connected to the
network is possible.

173
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.730 
You see this in everyday life, for
example here we in HPI of course

174
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:51.630 
we run such an Ethernet network that is
high in reliability, no central control

175
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:59.490 
very simple very efficient, has a high
stability even under heavy loads

176
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:06.490 
and this makes the Ethernet
the most popular example

177
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.650 
of a Local Area
Network.

1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.740 
We have discussed in detail how
password attacks can be performed

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.300 
by means of technical
devices, password cracker

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.060 
guessing, key logger and others.
Now we want to have a look on

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.820 
identity theft by social engineering.
What is social engineering?

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.290 
Social engineering the idea is
to exploit human weaknesses

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.840 
to provoke certain reactions,
for example using

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.940 
stolen identity to exploit the human

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.110 
weakness of a victim, for
example to use address of

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.290 
your ill friend or some
person you know quite well.

10
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.700 
The idea is to develop
a trust-relation

11
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.040 
or to develop a fear
relation, respect relation

12
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.810 
to misuse the human willingness
to help or other things

13
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.480 
and to perform by means
of this emotion

14
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.350 
some to force the user by this
emotion to do some action

15
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.890 
which is helpful for the
attacker to attack the system

16
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.960 
of the user. The victims are
convinced into doing something

17
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.520 
they would not do under normal
circumstance, for example

18
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.940 
if a person came and called you and
say your computer is wrong, there

19
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.000 
is some mistake and he is able
to establish a trust relation

20
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.820 
and then asks the victim
to repair your computer,

21
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.890 
to install something new, to
change your configuration

22
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.660 
tell me a simply your password
and then can I do for you.

23
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.400 
So the victim is convinced
into doing something

24
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.840 
into giving the attacker
the password and then the

25
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.350 
attacker has it. Issuing information
like the password, like

26
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.700 
other identity data or granting
access to protecting systems

27
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.350 
to protecting places and resources.
The most common method

28
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.440 
that is based on this social engineering
approach in the internet is phishing.

29
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.980 
Phishing - it's an artificial world
coming from fishing and the p from

30
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.120 
password, you're phishing.
This is a malicious method

31
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.140 
to obtain sensitive information.
A typical procedure is

32
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.470 
the dispatch from
a fraudulent

33
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.390 
emails, for example sent an email
from a trustworthy senders

34
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.260 
address for example an email from
your bank, an email from a company

35
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.560 
or another authority and then
the sender's address is

36
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.990 
selected specifically with
regards to the information

37
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.130 
to be collected. For example
the bank as the sender of

38
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.310 
address is selected if the
attacker wants to get access

39
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.150 
to the account to the bank
account of the user.

40
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.090 
The email addresses to work with
falsified email addresses

41
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.670 
quite easily in internet. It's
so called emails spoofing.

42
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.120 
There is some default in
the internet protocols,

43
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.500 
so the sender address of
an email is not checked.

44
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.000 
So for an attacker it's
easy to work with

45
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.870 
faked address. The confidence that's
gained by the alleged sender

46
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.030 
is then abused to
cause some action

47
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.040 
a desire by the
attacker, for example

48
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.180 
publication of data,
for example a log in

49
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.170 
to the bank account and in
this way then the attacker

50
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.690 
gets access to the data to
the log in data or to

51
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.130 
let the victim install
some software, some

52
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.290 
malicious software which make
it possible for the attacker

53
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.260 
later to access his systems.
For your for example we have

54
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.060 
our victim gets
from the

55
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.910 
attacker's server an email,
an email for example

56
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.940 
that looks like
that it was sent

57
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.090 
from his home bank and then
the user follows, gives the

58
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.410 
credentials to a web page that
looks like the web page of

59
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.590 
his online bank but you
see here it's not

60
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.920 
bank here is hank.de,
so it is a falsified

61
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.570 
web page. So the user
has the impression

62
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.070 
that he logs in in his bank with
his online bank, online bank

63
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.270 
is here but he
does this

64
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.160 
with this manipulated website

65
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.030 
and then the data the login
data are automatically

66
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.300 
sent to the attackers and perhaps
forwarded also to the bank

67
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.590 
to the real server of the bank
so that the user is not

68
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.880 
aware that the attacker
in this way has phished

69
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.550 
his data. The email is sent
with a falsified address.

70
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.840 
The victim clicks
the link that

71
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.030 
is sent to him in the email
this link leads to a

72
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.580 
fake web - to a malicious
website, it looks

73
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.930 
like it leads to the real
bank but in reality it

74
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.580 
link to this attacker's

75
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.480 
web page that really
looks very very similar

76
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.560 
to the web page of the bank
and then the data are

77
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.400 
forwarded to
the attacker.

78
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.630 
The email sent from falsified senders
is a real danger because one does not

79
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.330 
look so carefully one thinks ok
this is my bank and then one

80
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.760 
do some actions
that typically

81
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.230 
requested from the bank or
this is from a family member

82
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.810 
or others.

83
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.710 
There is a chance to realize
that the attacker works with

84
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.560 
faked address. So here is an
example a message that

85
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.520 
apparently came from paypal. But
here if you look very careful

86
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:05.480 
it's not PayPal, it's
paypla.com and this is the

87
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.340 
web page of the attacker and
it looks very much similar

88
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.680 
to the paypal page so hence the
user is not realizing that

89
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.190 
he or she is on
a faked page

90
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.070 
but one has a chance to identify
it if one has a closer

91
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
look to sender.

92
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.770 
There are more things
that can be detected.

93
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.680 
There are sometimes
some small mistakes.

94
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.760 
So the page is not really
identical to the paypal page

95
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.730 
and one detects
such differences

96
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.410 
one can get a feeling whether it's
a fake page or whether it's

97
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.900 
the original one. So to prompt the
recipient to reveal account data

98
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.470 
which helps then
the attacker,

99
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.760 
for example to log in to
then do some action

100
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.050 
on the real paypal
account of the user.

101
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.800 
Phishing often recognized by small
linguistic errors or missing

102
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.520 
personal address, so for
example hello customer.

103
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.930 
Typically the bank page
welcomes you with your name

104
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.630 
but in a hurry one is
not aware of this

105
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.760 
so this is our signs that
this is not the real

106
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.780 
web page this is a fake web
page of the attacker.

107
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.550 
If one gets this
mail and if

108
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:49.060 
one has a feeling that the
emails that the link links

109
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.780 
to the web page with the prompt
for the account details

110
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.230 
so it looks very much like the
paypal page and here you see

111
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.560 
the user gives in
all the secret

112
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.980 
information. So a careless victim
then gives all this information

113
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.700 
and then this information is sent
to the attacker and the attacker

114
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.640 
has it in his hand.

115
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.230 
So social engineering
phishing attacks are

116
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.810 
widespread. The conventional phishing
attacks are now relatively

117
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.920 
easy to spot for example I mentioned
this already by the small

118
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.760 
spelling errors
or by speaking

119
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.660 
to you as a customer
and not by your name.

120
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:46.750 
And so this typically
phishing mails

121
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:52.720 
are distributed very widely and
very unspecifically so that

122
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.090 
there are many many
receivers getting this

123
00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:01.750 
mail and from that many it is
enough if only a few answer and

124
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.980 
and send the information. So many
millions of such potential

125
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.340 
victims already a very
low conversion rate

126
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.630 
is sufficient to achieve
significant success

127
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:20.260 
to get access at least of a
few people with for example

128
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.890 
the bank account information.
Problems for the attackers

129
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.760 
are that during the
last time the media

130
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.170 
sensitized internet users and
explains them how phishing

131
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.860 
is working and there
are many information

132
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.650 
that one should look very careful
to sender address, to small

133
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.620 
spelling errors and others
so they draw attention

134
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.620 
to the common phishing
networks. The phishing

135
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.410 
emails reach many recipients
to whom the context

136
00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.540 
does not fit, for example
there is a sent

137
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.650 
phishing mail with
asking you to

138
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.310 
log into your bank
account but it comes

139
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.580 
from a wrong bank house.
It's not your personal one

140
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.830 
it's another bank house. So
this is because these

141
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.720 
phishing mails are sent
to millions of people

142
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.020 
and the attacker did not a lot
of effort to exactly find

143
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.700 
the information about the
receiver of sender.

144
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.770 
Here is this example I
mention - sender is a bank

145
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:37.130 
where the victim has no
account. So in the last time

146
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.530 
personalized phishing
became more and more

147
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:48.440 
important and dangerous. So the
traditional widespread phishing

148
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.290 
is no longer appropriate for
guaranteed information retrieval

149
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.930 
and to obtain the
sensitive information.

150
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.730 
Therefore the attacker
takes more time,

151
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:05.770 
so called spear phishing, to take
more time to send personalized

152
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.840 
fishing mails. So they
start in the beginning

153
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:17.100 
they start to analyze social media
to collect a highly detailed

154
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.150 
information about their
victim in order to gain

155
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.900 
their trust. So they do not make
mistakes they find out which

156
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:30.440 
bank is used by this particular
user so that they exactly send

157
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:35.460 
the website of that bank, or they
find out what is the family

158
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:41.170 
relation where the
receiver can be

159
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.630 
brought to some action that
are useful for the attacker.

160
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.700 
The reference to persons for
example friend, family member,

161
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.580 
or colleagues whom the victim
knows and trusts and this can

162
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.450 
be found by analyzing social
media or the victim believes

163
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.320 
that email comes from
this trusted person,

164
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.870 
so then it's no more so
careful and follows the

165
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.790 
requested activities. So this
spear phishing attacks

166
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:19.320 
became very successful, so
they are more work for

167
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.690 
there is much more individualized
the attacker has to analyze

168
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.920 
has to spy out the person has to
find out many details about

169
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.700 
the person but then with
this very personalized

170
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:36.200 
phishing emails, the
user often follow

171
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:42.290 
what the attacker wants to do
them. So personalized phishing

172
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.830 
is in this way very dangerous and
of course because this is such

173
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.980 
a lot of work it targets
to high-ranked person

174
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.600 
for example CEOs, politicians,
high-ranked officials,

175
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:59.630 
celebrities and others and they
are sent to persons in very

176
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.790 
sensitive sectors, for example
military, business, politics,

177
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.810 
financial or to
professional attackers

178
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.820 
for example state activists,
organized crime

179
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.180 
or others. There are many other
attacks on the internet

180
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.000 
which are based, which start with
such type of personalized

181
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.240 
phishing. This makes it really very dangerous
and one needs to be very careful.

182
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.040 
There are more techniques
for social engineering,

183
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:42.980 
for example so called baiting. This
is exploiting the curiosity

184
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.570 
the greed of victims
distributing gifts

185
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.830 
I sent you a gift and
to get full access

186
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.150 
you have to register here. Of
course then the gifts came with

187
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.600 
malicious secondary functions
for example USB sticks

188
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.400 
which were given
as a present

189
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.790 
which contain malicious software
which contain malicious apps.

190
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.090 
Pretexting is another social
engineering technique that is

191
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.630 
quite successful, this is
a fabrication of stories

192
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.410 
fabrication of lies of fake news
to induce a publication of

193
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.140 
victims information or
particular reactions.

194
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.940 
For example asking for help
for disaster victims

195
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.120 
or other touching
stories, empathetic to

196
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.860 
play against the
panic of a person

197
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.620 
by posing as a charity
organisation.

198
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.570 
So called reverse social
engineering. Here one speaks from

199
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.260 
reverse social engineering
if an attacker

200
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.240 
contacts the victim who is
seeking help and offers

201
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.750 
this help in order to
gain his or her trust

202
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:02.960 
and later on then
misuse his systems or

203
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.450 
his accounts. To give some
example from the past

204
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.570 
which were which became public,
then you see it start

205
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:16.390 
very early. Already 1980
Kevin Mitnick was a famous

206
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.390 
computer criminal,
famous hacker.

207
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.300 
He began his social
engineering attacks

208
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.370 
at the age of 15 and then
later on perfected the

209
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:32.430 
method he was often
arrested for several

210
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.470 
famous attacks, hacking attacks
for example he obtained access

211
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.440 
to dozens of computer
networks and so he was

212
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.340 
one of the most wanted
cybercriminals in the US.

213
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.180 
To come to our days 2010,
there was a famous attack

214
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.710 
against google. Google employees
were attacked by personalized

215
00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.100 
phishing. So the idea was now
idividual people inside

216
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.340 
google where
the addressee

217
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.290 
of such personalized phishing mails
and the phishing e-mails contained

218
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:13.160 
links to malicious software and
the google employees where

219
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.900 
brought to follow these
links and later on

220
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.380 
follows these links, the malicious
software was installed

221
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.830 
and later on the
attackers could access

222
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.960 
email accounts for example
from chinese activists

223
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:35.240 
and can see who is behind. There
is another

224
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.890 
famous security incident which
was based on social engineering.

225
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.420 
This was the RSA
security attack from

226
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.570 
2011. Also here RSA
a very famous

227
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.790 
security company
in the internet

228
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.420 
and also here employees
received emails

229
00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.560 
attached with an excel
personal plan and this plan

230
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.700 
contained worm flash worm
which later on attacked the

231
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:12.050 
RSA network and in the result there
were a theft of information

232
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:17.230 
from RSA security idea.
This is a token,

233
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.040 
security token
distributed very much

234
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:25.160 
and this information
from that RSA secureId

235
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.940 
later on was enabled the
attackers for example to

236
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.860 
step in and attack an
arms manufacturer or

237
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.300 
StratFor. 2012
Mat Honan case -

238
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.370 
this was discussed
very much in the

239
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.400 
social media, Mat
Honan is also

240
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.920 
in the tech magazine
Wired and they

241
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.140 
complete undercutting of
the digital identity

242
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.370 
of Honan through social engineering
attacked from service

243
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.090 
employees at apple and amazon. So
is there is an interesting story

244
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.190 
and he when you find out that
he was attacked Mat Honan

245
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.520 
published this. So
the attack target

246
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.250 
was Honan's twitter
account which were

247
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.840 
attacked and from which
malicious and fake information

248
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:29.160 
was sent. Another method for social
engineering are precautions.

249
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.210 
The sensation of users
and employment to safety

250
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:43.040 
awareness, so to help to make the
people more clear what are the

251
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.420 
dangers in the internet. So
particular in the context

252
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.550 
of social engineering this
precaution is very important

253
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.670 
and to raise the safety awareness.
This is by the way also

254
00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.620 
a goal an important
goal of our

255
00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.210 
openHPI course. We do
it by education

256
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.560 
it's also possible by performing
occasional phishing tests

257
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.140 
and see whether the
employees follow

258
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:16.730 
this recommendation in this
phishing mails and then

259
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.410 
to explain be more
careful to this

260
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.590 
employees or to this peoples. The
verification of the identity

261
00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.210 
of the alleged
correspond

262
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.130 
is important for example
is there a doubt

263
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:37.560 
then ask for
getting a proof

264
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.600 
that this person is really
the person you trust.

265
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.110 
Secure authentication is very
important, for example by means

266
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.880 
of trustworthy certificates. So
that it's really clear if

267
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.910 
a person has access to
the system that it's

268
00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.870 
really that person. The responsibility
handling of personal

269
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.530 
data and information is an
important point and a precaution

270
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.820 
here. What is given to
the outside world,

271
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.180 
what is published on the website,
what is given into google,

272
00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.990 
what is published in facebook?
The more information you give,

273
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.650 
the more detailed information
you give the more easily

274
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.680 
is it for the attacker for
example for such spear phishing

275
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.280 
to find relevant information,
relevant contacts

276
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.120 
in your social media, in your
published social media.

277
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.750 
Precaution against phishing - if we
look particular to that point,

278
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.620 
read emails very careful,
look for typing errors,

279
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.810 
look whether it's the right
logo of the company

280
00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.690 
and look for authority names,
check the address of the email.

281
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.160 
Not always is the name that's
displayed by your email address

282
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:05.140 
the real address it's
possible to have a closer

283
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:11.050 
look to thieves address. So if
sensitive information is requested

284
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.120 
account access, password then
request the conformation

285
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.480 
of a service provider whether
it's really necessary.

286
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.880 
Then this is a very
important hint,

287
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.020 
we will see also
in other context -

288
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.100 
you should not
follow a link but

289
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:36.270 
with it the service mentioned
in the email by yourself.

290
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.160 
So go via google for example
to look whether it's true.

291
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.040 
If you follow the link there
is a chance that you end up

292
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.010 
on a web page of the attackers
and give them your data.

293
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.310 
This is our few precautions
against phishing, against

294
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.270 
social engineering besides
technical attacks.

295
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.810 
The human is a weak point
and attackers try

296
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.300 
to address this weak point by
social engineering methods

297
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.140 
to get some sensitive information,

298
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.080 
to steal some identity
data of an user.

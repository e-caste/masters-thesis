00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.580 
Is the entrepreneur pursuit of
innovation unique to small businesses?

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.590 
Well, better not. Today's innovation
imperative requires more

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.300 
and more organizations to foster and
develop the entrepreneurial power

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
among their employees. In this
video, we will provide you with

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.070 
an overview on the phenomenon of entrepreneurship
in large established organizations.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.040 


7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
Welcome to this video of the
course Digital Entrepreneurship.

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.640 
My name is Valeska Maul and in the
following, Robert and I will

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.940 
outline the concept
of intrapreneurship.

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.730 
Following up on the
introducing words of Valeska,

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.870 
the rapid exploration and exploitation
of opportunities is not

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.230 
reserved for young ventures. In
fact, entrepreneurial minds enable

13
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.810 
large organizations to engage in the
innovation driven markets of our time.

14
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.380 
Defined as "those who take hands-
on responsibility for creating

15
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.080 
innovation of any kind
within the business",

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.990 
intrapreneurial employees and
the corresponding culture

17
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.550 
have become a key consideration for
organizations and entrepreneurship research.

18
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.120 
And beyond the apparent potential
that entrepreneurial action

19
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.700 
has for large
organizations,

20
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.230 
it is also about how they can better
respond to desires of their

21
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.840 
modern workforce. By creating a
culture that allows for ideas

22
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.930 
to thrive, by creating a sense of
purpose and meaning, individual

23
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.130 
responsibility and goals that
are worth venturing for,

24
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.360 
organizations can
leverage immense talent.

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.220 
But of course Robert, if it were that
easy, everyone would do it, right?

26
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.500 
Well, intrapreneurship is not a
new phenomenon. Research and

27
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.360 
practice have been concerned with
intrapreneurship for nearly four decades

28
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.080 
and no matter how it may be labelled, corporate
entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship

29
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.690 
the implementation of such remains a challenge
for most established organizations.

30
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.150 
The tension and barriers between
traditional management principles

31
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.250 
and the entrepreneurial mindset arise,
for example, from different motives,

32
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.810 
freedom versus control, different attitudes,
caution versus experimentation,

33
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.630 
as well as different tendencies
for action, that is delegating

34
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.380 
versus getting your
own hands dirty.

35
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.210 
We summarize the differences
between the administrative and

36
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.020 
entrepreneurial focus on the
slide displayed next to us.

37
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.980 
To overcome these
tensions and barriers,

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.070 
organizations need to consider
multiple facets of entrepreneurship.

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.110 
Drawing from the works of the distinguished
entrepreneurship scholar Robert Hisrich,

40
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.610 
intrapreneurship consists
of four key elements.

41
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.940 
First, Corporate Venturing, which
refers to the creation of new

42
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.020 
entities in existing
organizations.

43
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.510 
You probably have encountered
this in your own work context

44
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.210 
or seen it in the business news. So
called accelerators, innovation labs

45
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.850 
or digital apps are being
implemented to nurture a creative

46
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.300 
collaborative climate for
entrepreneurial teams

47
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.320 
protected from
organizational bureaucracy.

48
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.740 
Ideally, these labs should integrate
traditional research and development

49
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.740 
with entrepreneurial modes, such as the
lean startup approach. And second,

50
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.840 
intrapreneurship further relates
to the innovativeness as such.

51
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.910 
Specifically novel approaches for
the development of new products

52
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.400 
and services within
established divisions.

53
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.350 
For example, collaborative innovation
approaches such as design thinking

54
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.870 
can stimulate entrepreneurial action and user
centered thinking within the organization.

55
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.790 
Third, intrapreneurship also
translates into the self-renewal

56
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.080 
of the organization itself by revisiting
and redefining foundational,

57
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.150 
structures, processes and underlying
principles, organizations

58
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.240 
can adapt their
strategic direction.

59
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.300 
A prominent corresponding example
can be found in the digital

60
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.100 
transformation efforts of
today's organizations.

61
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.360 
And finally, pro-activeness is the fourth
key element of intrapreneurship.

62
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.890 
It involves the propensity to
take risks and initiative. It

63
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.180 
means to be bold to experiment,
to pursue opportunities and to

64
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.170 
encourage the introduction of new products,
services and internal processes.

65
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.390 
Okay Robert, so let us assume the top
management team is acknowledging

66
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.730 
the strategic implications
of entrepreneurship.

67
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.330 
What would be an example or means to
foster an entrepreneurial culture?

68
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.820 
Certainly there cannot be a standard
recipe for successful intrapreneurship.

69
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.490 
However key aspects involve for
example the tolerance for failure

70
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.490 
which can be addressed by balancing traditional
reward systems with special compensations

71
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.430 
and eventually establishing
experimentation as a learning strategy.

72
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.350 
Further, organizations should be
realistic about the goals of

73
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.860 
newly created accelerators
or innovation labs.

74
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.820 
While such entities can inspire
entrepreneurial practices, they

75
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.590 
are not long term solutions for
organizational innovation.

76
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.100 
And lastly managers should allow
for autonomy, risk and resources

77
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.760 
which signals confidence in
entrepreneurial endeavors.

78
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.410 
So we hope our introduction
to intrapreneurship

79
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.540 
could show that an entrepreneurial mindset
is not a matter of few individuals

80
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.500 
but a phenomenon that concerns
whole established organizations.

81
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.870

00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.890 
OK, Tom. Now after talking
about version controlling

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.040 
where we were discussing
more about texts,

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.840 
which other tools do we have for sharing
information and collaborating but

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.310 
with more useful documents and
excel tables? I wouldn't say that

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.600 
source code isn't useful but...
No no no but for collaborating

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.110 
and editing what do we have
there? OK, so we have basically

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.420 
two types of tools here

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.160 
one of them is allowing
that you are editing

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.470 
files collaboratively
on the same time

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.470 
and not text files or also
text files but not only

11
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.820 
text files, plain text files, and
then we have document shares

12
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.590 
which means it's kind
of a central server

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.370 
where you have your
documents lying and then

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.300 
everybody can fetch them,
can can work on them

15
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.410 
and can upload the new versions
and then you have some sort of

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.840 
version in there as
well, and basically

17
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.980 
most of these collaborative
editing tools that I'm talking

18
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.310 
about they evolved
somehow out of

19
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.940 
some sort of document shares, so
they used to be document shares

20
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.750 
and then.. these are particularly
for the documents where

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.690 
you really can work on or on
which you really can work on

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.050 
at the same time, they
kind of allowed that

23
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.270 
at a later point that you
can do that as well.

24
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.250 
And maybe one of the
one of the most

25
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.790 
best known of these tools is
for example google docs

26
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.060 
or google drive. Google drive will be
document share while google docs is kind

27
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750 
of the tool that allows you to
edit these things in real

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.470 
time together with others or
you have the tools from

29
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.300 
Microsoft you have open source
tools like Libre Office

30
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.330 
online, or you have also smaller
tools like the Etherpad.

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.930 
So and also in the file
sharing area there's lots of

32
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.730 
different tools and again
as we said in all of the

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.440 
other videos before so you always
have enterprise solutions

34
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.750 
you always have open source
solutions and you always

35
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.550 
have some sort of cloud based. And you
decide depending on what you need

36
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.390 
and the security and what else that you have.
Exactly, so let's have a look at that

37
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.900 
this is a simple example
from the Etherpad

38
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.950 
one of the most simple kind
of these collaborative

39
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.750 
editing tools but basically it
works pretty much the same as

40
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.390 
LibreOffice or Office
365 or Google Docs

41
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.650 
also working so you have a
document, text document

42
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.980 
or spreadsheet whatever Etherpad
only supports the text

43
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.220 
documents but the others would
also support these other kind

44
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.410 
of tools like
spreadsheets or so

45
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.420 
and then you can write in this
document simultaneously with

46
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.000 
other people and you can normally..
it's highlighted somehow

47
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.980 
with the colors who wrote
what, and you can try to

48
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.610 
I mean you have to take little
care of not kind of deleting

49
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.170 
what the other one
was just doing

50
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.930 
accidentally, so then if one
wants to do that he can do that

51
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.170 
and normally you can set
or the tool does that

52
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.330 
automatically you can set
a color code for each

53
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.630 
participant in
this process.

54
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.340 
Some of these tools like
the Etherpad also

55
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.110 
have a chat included so you can
discuss on certain changes

56
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.490 
at the same time without
leaving the tool

57
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.580 
while editing without having to
write that into the file what you

58
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.260 
just wanted to talk about
or other tools like

59
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.450 
Google Docs go in a little
different way they these

60
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.510 
comments that you can add
which are basically

61
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.000 
saying as such. Let me ask you
something because you mentioned

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.410 
before Google Docs, Office
365 and this other

63
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.330 
tool, can you interact with
different tools at the same time?

64
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.650 
If I work in a document in
Google Docs then I can

65
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.880 
open also it in Microsoft Office
or is there any compatibility

66
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.370 
there? Well there are two issues
that you need to think about

67
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.780 
I think it doesn't work actually
I've never tried it but I'm

68
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.900 
pretty sure it doesn't work that
one of the participants is

69
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.780 
opening a document in
Microsoft Office

70
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.930 
and the other one is working
on the same document

71
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.580 
in Google Docs. It is possible
to to do that one after

72
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.980 
the other so
you can open

73
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.430 
the Google Docs
document

74
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.960 
in Microsoft Office and the
other way around but not

75
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.290 
at the same time. Yes. And
in kinda not merging

76
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.000 
the changes then and then the other
issue that you have to think

77
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.250 
about is that formatting in my
experience at least in most

78
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.140 
cases is I'm looking forward
it's not offensive.

79
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.830 
It is a problem!
so you kind of

80
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.450 
lose.. the headlines will
look different, the fonts

81
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.170 
some might have changed and so
it normally doesn't look the

82
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.560 
way you wanted to look and... It is
somehow compatible but... it's somehow

83
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.270 
compatible, the content can
probably still will be there

84
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.180 
but it doesn't it look
as good as it used

85
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.770 
as a good look.. So
with that real

86
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.080 
time collaboration chat you
will have that in there..

87
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.530 
Document shares are
basically for documents

88
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.610 
that you really cannot
edit simultaneously. At

89
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.040 
least, I don't know I'm not a
super expert in there. I mean

90
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.190 
there are tools like Adobe
Cloud but I don't know

91
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.790 
exactly how they are working
but as far as I know, there

92
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.950 
is still no image editor
where everybody can

93
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.960 
work on simultaneously on
the same image at the

94
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.990 
same time. Maybe I am wrong!
I'd like to hear about that.

95
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.760 
It would be nice to hear about that.
But so in this case, if you have

96
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.140 
like such a real binary file
like an image for example,

97
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.570 
you really would need like one
person is one user is working

98
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.670 
on the file at one point of time
and then you tell the other

99
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.880 
one I'm finished with the ears now
you can add the nose. You can take

100
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.780 
it. OK so that would be
kind of a step by step

101
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.050 
process, but still kind
of the same document

102
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.920 
at the same storage
location.

103
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.050 
Thank you Tom. Document sharing
and document collaboration is

104
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.700 
really a topic for the
remote workers to consider

105
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.090 
because of course they are working
together, they need to share

106
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.660 
information and this seems
to be quite a reliable way

107
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.500 
to share.. In the community I
believe they have already

108
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.920 
experiences with this kind of tools.
Will you recommend some other

109
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.900 
collaboration editors
or documents share.

110
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.550 
Please join the discussion. we're
looking forward for that.

111
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.120 
Thank you Tom.
Thank you Salim.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.469 
Hello, it's me again.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.919 
Wolfram Greis, from the European Maintenance Academy.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.179 
And in the next video clip, I want to give you a short demonstration,

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.179 
what you can do with the interactive storage management facility.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.279 
It's an ISPF dialog that is integrated

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.559 
into ISPF. And in this case, I've already started

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.209 
to see the ISPF with

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.709 
our master application menu in your installation or

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.929 
in different installation.

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.810 
It depends on where such

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.809 
functions are integrated into the menu system.

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.669 
In our case, you see, we have one pointier,

13
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.109 
one selection possibility, it's called I for I ISMF

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.699 
and if I type in

15
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.589 
I in the master application menu, I get to

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.469 
the ISMF by my option menu.

17
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.459 
And you see we have a lot of possibilities here.

18
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.019 
What you can do and what is offered here is dependent of the

19
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.125 
authorization, what you are allowed to do and what is your role

20
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.989 
in such an environment. We have a lot of possibilities for each and every

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.429 
user and we have some special possibilities that are

22
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.869 
all only available for system or storage

23
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.789 
administrators.

24
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.319 
Let's have a look into the two or three of

25
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.237 
these selection possibilities.

26
00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:52.769 
First, I select dataset,

27
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.329 
I want to see what datasets are in my

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.979 
environment. And as example here, I can select

29
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.739 
the data set to name list.

30
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.209 
And in this case, I specify I want to see

31
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.870 
all data sets beginning with a high level qualifier

32
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.969 
EMA00 and dot asterisk.

33
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.159 
Asterisk means all data sets beginning with a EMA00.

34
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.439 
I hit the enter key and I get a list of the datasets

35
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.379 
and you can see here we have

36
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.139 
forty two columns with different attributes.

37
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.729 
And as example, one of the most important attribute of course

38
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.379 
is allocated space.

39
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.149 
And in this case, of course, I also can sort this list

40
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.059 
for the different columns as example.

41
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.619 
I can say now or specify sort.

42
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.059 
And this is the third column in this case sort column

43
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.619 
three in D, D means descending

44
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.259 
order. And I hit the enter key and the result is I get

45
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.859 
the data set with the

46
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.865 
most allocated space

47
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.039 
in descending order here.

48
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.939 
What I post to

49
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.439 
the right side and look at have a look

50
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.419 
at the other columns I you can see there are a lot of columns available

51
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.369 
as example, of course, the allocated units, the dataset

52
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.869 
organization, the record lengths to block size and

53
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.519 
so on. And also as examples of creation date and a second

54
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.410 
example to sort, I want to see which datasets

55
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.749 
were created to see the longest time ago.

56
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.999 
Again, I say thought and in this case column twenty twenty

57
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.049 
in and in this case descending order.

58
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.749 
And you see now Imar 002 drops

59
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.859 
see was created at the 1st of August in 2013.

60
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.669 
Just a brief introduction

61
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.729 
to the dataset possibilities.

62
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.499 
Let's have a look at the other possibility we can

63
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.879 
search for volume activities and volume information.

64
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.009 
I select the second argument here

65
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.589 
with the volume I select.

66
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.719 
I want to see the dust volumes, direct access dataset disc volumes

67
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.159 
in this case and now I can generate also

68
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.679 
a list. As examples of all volumes, starting

69
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.239 
with the three characters as white as something, and as in this

70
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.829 
case, we have two volumes and

71
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.269 
again, a lot of columns describing attributes belonging to

72
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.189 
these entries.

73
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.849 
Let's do the second example. I can say I want to see all the volumes, starting

74
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.009 
with two.

75
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.869 
And again, we got a least in this case with four volumes in

76
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.559 
our education environment, we have just a few

77
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.609 
dust volumes.

78
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.739 
So the list is not too long in a protective environment.

79
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.319 
You can have as example, around twenty

80
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.089 
thousand volumes listed here,

81
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.540 
though normally in productive environments you get much bigger listings.

82
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.799 
Let's go back and to the payment option.

83
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.359 
Many of I assume if and we talked in our video

84
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.829 
clips about the SRS constructs and here I

85
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.989 
can see we have these constructs here.

86
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.459 
It's a management class, the data storage class and the

87
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.609 
storage group. And I just show you an example.

88
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.729 
I want to have a look into the storage class.

89
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.599 
So I have five in the ISP diaspora finally up to me.

90
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.099 
And I get now to submenu

91
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.889 
and I want to see all the storage classes.

92
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.480 
In this case. It means just the asterisk here and

93
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.129 
the entire key. And you see now the list of the storage

94
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.709 
classes that are implemented here.

95
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.269 
OK, the last thing I want to show you is the automatic

96
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.799 
plus selection, and we talked

97
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.269 
about that the automatic selection routines are very important for an

98
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.789 
automatic storage management.

99
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.589 
So I select the selection keys, seven year automatic

100
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.089 
selection and he'll see what you can do as a storage administrator to

101
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.289 
define these automatic selection routines.

102
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.119 
You can edit them. You can translate them into an object

103
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.189 
form. You can validate these routines.

104
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.479 
You can test these routines.

105
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.189 
This is a very important point that you can define test

106
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.929 
cases and to test the routines you so really

107
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.459 
do what you planned that they should

108
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.579 
do. You can display information.

109
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.349 
And of course, you also can delete it as objects

110
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.259 
from the environment.

111
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.989 
And just an example to show you the added function, I

112
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.729 
type in it. And with the added function, you can go into very

113
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.589 
normal datasets, your own data datasets to to

114
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.049 
play around with these routines.

115
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.409 
And in this case, I selected WHO W.T.

116
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.539 
are Todd Smith is.

117
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.439 
This would means the ascertains.

118
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.629 
I am with the Kentucky and I get a selection

119
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.279 
menu selection of my expertize here and now.

120
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.709 
I can select as example.

121
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:47.449 
See, we had to look into the storage class

122
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.969 
environment. Let's have a look into the s c r o h

123
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.769 
hootin here. I say select and you can the c

124
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.039 
e s hootin in this case for the

125
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.709 
storage class or H don't

126
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.299 
go into any details here.

127
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.239 
What has to be done and how the hootin is set up.

128
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.679 
Just to show. I just wanted to show you that you have all these

129
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.599 
interactive possibilities to the few data

130
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.429 
in your environment and

131
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.899 
to control your environment to

132
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.589 
edit and, and um verify your

133
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.759 
routines, activate of course your teens and so on.

134
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.399 
This is the year.

135
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.439 
These are the possibilities of the interactive storage

136
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.539 
management facility.

137
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.229 
I think that's enough for this short demo.

138
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:59.089 
And if you have any questions or remarks, please

139
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.919 
use the discussion forum on our

140
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.169 
openHPI platform.

141
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.059 
Thank you so much for attending and see you in one of our next

142
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.060 
video clips.

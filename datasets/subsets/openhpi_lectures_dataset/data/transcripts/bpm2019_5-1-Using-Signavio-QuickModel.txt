00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.300 
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to week
number five to video clip 5.1

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.190 
using the Signavio QuickModel
in which I'd like to show you

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.730 
how to use the feature which is so
called Signavio QuickModel in order to

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.150 
capture process information on
the table based approach.

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.870 
You don't want to start modelling
directly you just want

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.320 
to provide information of the process
you already have or have collected

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.580 
and you want to put it on the table
and the system generates you

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.060 
based on information the
process automatically.

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.520 
Wouldn't it be great?

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.130 
This is actually possible by
using Signavio QuickModel.

11
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.550 
I will show in a few
minutes how to use it

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.620 
and the tool but basically
everything starts with some

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.920 
kind of fact sheet about the process
where you can provide all information

14
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.940 
which are related to
the process like

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.030 
in which organizations the
process takes place,

16
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.410 
and what's start event, what's
the end event of the process.

17
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.100 
You can also provide all the
information what should provide

18
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.060 
all information on the task level so
which task needs to be executed,

19
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.090 
by whom for example and also
what kind of system is

20
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.450 
used, what data
is used.

21
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.410 
You can also add through the
attributes further information

22
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.480 
behind every task. Means for
example what kind of documents

23
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.480 
are used to execute a task, what are
the costs, what are the times behind

24
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.120 
activities tasks and in the
end the system is able after

25
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.620 
providing these kind of information
to generate the process model

26
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.110 
automatically.

27
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.760 
Why should I should I start this
way when I when I know exactly

28
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.070 
how to model process?

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.980 
Well it helps to focus on one
specific path. If you imagine

30
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.540 
you are in the company and you
want to figure out or want to

31
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.670 
model a certain process and
you need to interview people

32
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.930 
asking them what are they doing
in the process. Therefore

33
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.360 
it helps to simply capture all
information you have collected

34
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.840 
by interviewing the

35
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.840 
interviewing the person and put it
into one table don't think about

36
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.170 
how the designers how it looks like
simply put information to the table

37
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.160 
to generate the happy path for
example. The happy path means

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.340 
what is the standard default scenario without
exceptional cases without error conditions

39
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.170 
only from the way from
start to the end

40
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.640 
and extended step wise what
happen if the customer hasn't

41
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.630 
paid or what happen if and the
order can't can't be delivered

42
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
for example. But for the first it helps
it really helps to focus on one

43
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.310 
specific execution
I would say.

44
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.700 
It's also good for

45
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.230 
for new modellers I would say, for
beginners who have no special

46
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.830 
knowledge about BPMN or not
yet. They can easily start

47
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.260 
with just provide information see
ok this generates a task such

48
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.030 
generates a gateway for example and
simply collect all information

49
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.500 
they need.

50
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.750 
I want to show you

51
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.590 
how it looks like
in practice.

52
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.780 
Therefore I switched to the
Signavio process manager.

53
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.730 
Click on you and as you can see
here we have the features of

54
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.760 
Signavio QuickModel.

55
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.000 
When you open that we generate
a new tab which simply shows

56
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.620 
I would say the fact sheet of the
process which is so currently blank

57
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.710 
and we can start
now with filling

58
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.940 
some information
like request

59
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.780 
for car insurance. So if you are
in a car insurance company

60
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.080 
these process should describe
what happens if we get

61
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.810 
an incoming request
to insure a car.

62
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.370 
Here would say
this is the car

63
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.120 
insurance company.

64
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.330 
We could even provide full documentation
behind the process to describe

65
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.770 
verbally what the process
is about, not only

66
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.110 
designing the activities or
modelling activities, we can

67
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.570 
also provide this process or write
information like this process is about

68
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.090 
dealing with an incoming
car insurance request

69
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.950 
until the car gets actually insured
for example. This is just a verbal

70
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.550 
description of
the process.

71
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.250 
But the important information are
where the process takes place

72
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.630 
this is what we've already
provided and also what triggers

73
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.220 
the process. And I
would say this is

74
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.130 
the incoming request.

75
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.320 
Requests received. What
ends the process?

76
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.640 
I would say the end, proper
end would be here that the

77
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.720 
car's actually insured.

78
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.630 
If needed we can also provide further
attributes onto the diagram level.

79
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.290 
If we show all the diagram
or all the attributes

80
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.260 
we are able to to provide
more information for

81
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.280 
the entire process. Who is the
process owner what is next review

82
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.530 
date do we have customers action
the process. All these things

83
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.920 
could be providing the attributes but
it's not important for the first step.

84
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.910 
Therefore I just hide it and we
focus on the activities which

85
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.130 
needs to be done after

86
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.030 
we received an
incoming request.

87
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.700 
So what needs to be
done? I would say

88
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.470 
one of the first activities
after the request comes in

89
00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.630 
would be we need to record
the insurance information.

90
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.710 
Who is responsible for that? So
which department will do that?

91
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.980 
And I would say this is so called
has more rules, so the caseworker

92
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.830 
and as you can see here
already has a system

93
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.500 
already uses the information
and generates a BPMN process

94
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.100 
model from it.

95
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.070 
The good thing is if we can work
very fast here we can say

96
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.310 
we could say the next one
would be check insurance

97
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.870 
insurance criterias.

98
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.520 
Also by the caseworker you can see here
already is a system places the same role

99
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.510 
automatically so we
could change that but

100
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.340 
most times you have a sequence
of activities executed

101
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.740 
by the same department therefore
it makes sense to use

102
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.750 
the same role for the
department name here.

103
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.400 
The next step would be calculate
annual premium if the

104
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.830 
criteria are met.

105
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.180 
Also by the caseworker

106
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.550 
as I said we focus for the first only
on the happy parts or the ideal pass

107
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.770 
without exceptions from
start to the end.

108
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.460 
You would say activate

109
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.820 
contract in system.

110
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.380 
Well actually contract is actually the
activity itself and system is more

111
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.430 
hint that we use a system for that,
I would say activate contract

112
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.060 
and that's it. It's these four
tasks are the main tasks which

113
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.240 
needs to be executed we can use
that now to yeah either to

114
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.440 
provide further information behind
every task we click on how

115
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.380 
we can provide a description, what
needs to be done in a certain task

116
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.230 
that's the advantage of

117
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.340 
of having a table based approach you
can simply click on every single

118
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.130 
task to provide
the information.

119
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.410 
We could also say I want to provide the
cost and times behind every activity,

120
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.920 
they can click on your

121
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.010 
click on this screwdriver
here on the

122
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.780 
button in order to show more
attributes were removed attributes

123
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.060 
I don't want
to use here.

124
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.600 
And I want to say execution time
execution costs for example

125
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.020 
this is important. Then we can
easily say this activity cost

126
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.710 
us, I don't know three euro two
euro four euro one euro so as you

127
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:36.380 
can see is quite easy to provide these
kind of formation in the table.

128
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.770 
Which cost centre will be charged also
important question in practice and companies

129
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.200 
in order to to assign the cost
and value of the cost later

130
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.120 
but it's not
important for now.

131
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.690 
Yeah what we can do now is we
can use this initial path

132
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.100 
of process, this
happy path

133
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.020 
after interviewing the person
does this could be the outcome

134
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.970 
and now we can use this initial
path to switch to the graphic

135
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.190 
area and extend it
wherever needed.

136
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.840 
So again by clicking on your
name on the upper right corner

137
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.170 
you have different yeah
options to jump in different

138
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.470 
features but what we need to use now is
the graphical editor. The system says

139
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.130 
I'm leaving the editing mode
we want to save so yes.

140
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.710 
I want to save

141
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.330 
Now I can use, i can use
this process and refine it

142
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.650 
to a built in exceptional
passes for example.

143
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.830 
And here we could say

144
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.940 
I use the elements
we already know.

145
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.700 
He can use the create space
button for that to build in for

146
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.680 
the features that
say for example

147
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.080 
after checking the
insurance criterias

148
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.620 
several things could could
happen. We could say

149
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.630 
we have a gateway and it could
be the case that the interest

150
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.360 
criteria are not met, so
someone is not eligible to

151
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.490 
for insurance or someone is
eligible or the case needs

152
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.430 
to be reviewed by another
person which is also

153
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.190 
possible. This actually I think
what I want to model right now.

154
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.010 
We want to add another lane which
could be called the manager.

155
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.380 
I zoom out a bit in order to get a
better overview of the process

156
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.830 
and you could say if

157
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.130 
for example if the case
needs to be reviewed

158
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.850 
let's remove a bit of
space here. It's a bit

159
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.860 
too much. This needs to
be done by the manager.

160
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.680 
So review case,

161
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.450 
let's move it a bit
to the right side

162
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.150 
and it could
happen that

163
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.490 
the case where someone or the
case needs to be reviewed it

164
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.570 
goes to the manager. The
manager decides ok

165
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.170 
after review I can I can
still decide or I can

166
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.580 
still say hey its approved
or not approved.

167
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.900 
Therefore I
would say here

168
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.880 
what happens in
case of approval.

169
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.950 
So the result
of the review

170
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.690 
one of one of the outcomes
could be approved.

171
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.010 
You can see already here that the
condition is written on the

172
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.380 
on the sequence flow

173
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:48.420 
and if you probably have seen
this that we still need to name

174
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.880 
the gateway here

175
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.850 
could be named
as a result

176
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.640 
of retail check.

177
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.790 
And it could be the case that someone
is as I mentioned illegible

178
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.110 
or the case needs
to be reviewed.

179
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.890 
This describes already that we have
a task to check for criterias

180
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.230 
and the gateway reads out the
results coming out from the task

181
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.990 
and the result could be the case
need to be reviewed where

182
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.070 
someone is directly eligible to go to
the next step calculates a premium.

183
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:42.620 
What happens now if someone is rejected
or will be rejected for example?

184
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.130 
Then we could say that

185
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.210 
this needs to be

186
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.300 
needs to be done
with, sorry

187
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.580 
this is an exception
he would say

188
00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.100 
the case worker needs to prepare
a letter of rejection.

189
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.890 
In case of gets
rejected

190
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.790 
and I would even say that the
process ends already here

191
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.300 
with the case rejection

192
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.550 
send as an outgoing message event
because we send out the rejection.

193
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.110 
Oh I need to change the set of elements,
I'm still working with the core elements

194
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.970 
but the message end event is not
part of the core elements ever

195
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.460 
need to change to the complete view to
have all elements in BPMN available

196
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.720 
and I can also
transform

197
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.280 
to the end message
event. Alright

198
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.730 
that is actually not the entire
process. I mean a lot of stuff

199
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.600 
can can still can still
happen here. For example

200
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.880 
activate the contract would be
the ideal case we carry it

201
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.790 
but it could also
happen that

202
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:19.400 
we we calculate
the premium

203
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.960 
have another activity
in there to

204
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.600 
send or create send
the contract, sorry

205
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.500 
send contract

206
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.620 
and after that we have no clue
what happens next. Either the

207
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.540 
external or the the customer
sends the acceptance to

208
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.260 
say hey the contract is fine
for me we can we can go ahead

209
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.340 
or he rejects the
contract or he

210
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.990 
doesn't show any reaction. I
mean the customer does answer

211
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.230 
which can also happen.

212
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.640 
How to model that?

213
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.200 
This actually

214
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.420 
thing which can be
modelled very easily.

215
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.740 
We could use

216
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.280 
the event based gateway here which
allows us now to model these kind of

217
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.700 
things. So say hey it
could happen that

218
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.840 
the customer accepts our contract.
Would be the ideal case, then

219
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.690 
the next activity will follow we can
activate the contract and system

220
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.880 
cars in short.

221
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.110 
cntract where I would
say acceptance

222
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.770 
received. This is a
better naming oops

223
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.750 
a better naming
for events.

224
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.100 
But could also be the case that the
customer doesn't show any reaction.

225
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.230 
In that case it would be a timer
event and we could say here

226
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.050 
no answer here

227
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:07.170 
after five days.
That means

228
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.380 
this is a racing event either
we get the acceptance or the

229
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.500 
cut the customer doesn't really
react to our contract and then

230
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.580 
the system wait with a
process wait and the same

231
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.470 
five days then this events becomes true.
This is so called racing events.

232
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:28.000 
The first thing which happened a would
determine how the process will continue.

233
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.180 
What happens after the contract
after the customer doesn't answer?

234
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.350 
We will send after five
days send reminder.

235
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.970 
And even then we could say we are
still back at the same point

236
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.760 
after sending
the reminder.

237
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.910 
Both things can happen either we
get to acceptance or we need

238
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.860 
or the customer simply
doesn't react.

239
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.260 
Therefore I would say we have
a merge here, we can you see

240
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.110 
the helpful just a little helps here
like like moving the sequence flow

241
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.680 
in order to jump back into
the process and we are

242
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.110 
on the same page
as before.

243
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:14.990 
I'd like to add
another possibility

244
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:23.870 
which is the rejection so it
could also be the case that we

245
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.820 
receive a rejection.

246
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.500 
The customer doesn't
except our contract

247
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.970 
then we could say
in that case

248
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:45.110 
we yeah we confirmed the
rejection and yeah and it's

249
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:51.860 
the process ends.
Rejection confirmed.

250
00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.110 
Also an end event because we
send out the confirmation of

251
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.220 
the rejection say hey

252
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.880 
we've received
a rejection,

253
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.560 
we'd like to confirm that we've
received a rejection and so on.

254
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.360 
The only thing which
can still happen is

255
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.400 
that someone is already not
eligible in the beginning or

256
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.210 
from the beginning on.

257
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:27.100 
Therefore we could even say
we have a jump from here

258
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.490 
directly to the point prepare
letter of rejection.

259
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.810 
It looks a bit like a
mess but it still

260
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.300 
connects the elements
therefore I just

261
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.050 
oh wait it's actually was a wrong one.
I need to jump from here sorry.

262
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.800 
This is a way how
to connect it.

263
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.050 
A good style BPMN would be
now to in modelling would

264
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:16.300 
be now not to use overlaying
edges because it's hard to see

265
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.520 
what conditions are going out
here. and it's even it's clear

266
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.360 
for legible but not clear for
these both, right. Which

267
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.160 
condition do we see here? Therefore it
is better to distinct them a bit and

268
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.980 
to have a little bit um yeah to
move the bit to the right side

269
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.930 
in order to to see ok there are
two outgoing conditions here

270
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.370 
or at least from
this corner on

271
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.860 
and this allows me or it's more
more clear for anyone else

272
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.990 
that we have in total
three conditions here.

273
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:54.610 
And this would be the
condition not eligible.

274
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.850 
I would even put it yeah I
would put it here, that's it.

275
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.420 
And the last step I would do is if necessary
I can even use data objects to say

276
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.300 
we generate the or we have a
value here in the process

277
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.520 
at this point.
We could say

278
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.540 
the annual premium is a value
we need for the following

279
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.840 
for the following
activity.

280
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.840 
So for example when you
use this data object

281
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.370 
or you know that the data
object will be created after

282
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.180 
executing activity calculate any
premium it can also be used

283
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.300 
for the next activity which
is create and send contract

284
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.840 
and of course the contract
includes the annual premium.

285
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.910 
With this way you can you can
emphasize that a certain object

286
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.330 
is needed in the process or
is created in the process

287
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.950 
and you can denote or can model
at which point in the process

288
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.120 
it's to be used.

289
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.340 
The same here I would rather say
the insurance information itself

290
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.900 
are created here. So we record the
insurance information but these

291
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.570 
are important to determine the next step
or to execute the next step actually

292
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.190 
which is check
insurance criterias.

293
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.240 
There's only one point
missing in the process

294
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.160 
which is now

295
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.990 
we can on one hand we could make
a drink where we can remove

296
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.770 
the space which isn't
needed on the other hand

297
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.350 
we can also easily it
in a very fast way

298
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.190 
the customer or the
request I would say.

299
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.320 
You could say at
this point we get

300
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.210 
sorry we get the request
by the incoming

301
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.120 
from the customer.

302
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.550 
We send something out or
even here we could say

303
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.660 
this is the thing which we
also get from the customer

304
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.970 
the rejection or
the acceptance.

305
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.340 
So this is a good way how
to how we can model

306
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.600 
the interaction with external participants
and we also send something out

307
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:31.670 
of course which is either
the confirmation

308
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:36.500 
or the information that
the car gets insured.

309
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.230 
Which is still
missing sorry

310
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.020 
we could say here the end message
event could be car insured.

311
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.130 
This is also an information we
send to the customer we should

312
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.950 
but also any other kind of
information like the rejection

313
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.460 
or the confirmation
of the rejection

314
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.180 
of the letter we send directly
if we reject a customer

315
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.430 
can also be sent
to the customer.

316
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:13.780 
That shows how we can um yeah how we
can extend the process which has been

317
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.510 
in the initial construction
which has been created

318
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.580 
initially by using
Signavio QuickModel

319
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.190 
and was extended in the
Signavio graphical editor

320
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.060 
to add further components like data objects
like exceptional exceptional passes

321
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.210 
and also show the
interaction to other

322
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.730 
participants.

323
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.460 
This concludes video
clip five point one.

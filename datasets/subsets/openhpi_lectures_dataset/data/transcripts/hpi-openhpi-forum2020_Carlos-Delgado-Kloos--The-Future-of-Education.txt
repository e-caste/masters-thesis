1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280 
the covir-19 pandemic has accelerated the
pace of adoption of digital technologies.

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
people who were not interested
or even reluctant in adopting

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.790 
them were forced by the
sanitary situation.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.380 
it has turned out that the advantages
of using digital technologies.

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.130 
leaving aside even the positive side
effects such as less commuting time,

6
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.980 
less traffic jams or less pollution.
it turns out that it is

7
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.520 
possible to work and learn from
home. of course, provided that

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.780 
you have a good environment at home
and a good internet connection.

9
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.160 
and people liked it we are seeing
even changes in national

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.890 
legislations that allow for some days
to work from the home office.

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.940 
but also in the education sector
we have seen that the digital

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.460 
medium has some advantages
over the physical one.

13
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.480 
for instance, lectures can be even
more participative when students

14
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.130 
use the chat channel to pose
questions without interrupting

15
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.620 
the flow of explanations
of the professor,

16
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.260 
or breakout groups that can
be organized very easily,

17
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.150 
or automatic subtitling of the
spoken word can be arranged,

18
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.890 
or even simultaneous translations
can be provided with these.

19
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.380 
this does not mean that digital courses
are superior then face to face once,

20
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.390 
nor the contrary. one has to face it each
mode has its positive and negative aspects.

21
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.400 
and some may prevail over the
other depending on the context.

22
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.050 
or often a combination of both
forms might be the best choice.

23
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.240 
some technologies can be used even
in single settings independently,

24
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.200 
of whether they are online on site or hybrid.
for instance calling or engagement apps

25
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.200 
on the smartphone might be useful
in any of these settings.

26
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640 
what is also clear is that from
the teacher's point of view

27
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.650 
content and style when lecturing online
have to be adapted to the medium.

28
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.450 
a student might disengage more easily
when watching a lecture online.

29
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
and this can be partially
counterbalanced by the lecturer.

30
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.200 
the narrative the other visual
complement of the spoken word

31
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.470 
in the activities of all the activities
of the carried out by the students

32
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.840 
have to be adapted to
the digital medium.

33
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.300 
active teaching and learning techniques
are more necessary in online settings.

34
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.210 
now what will be the
future of education.

35
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.750 
before internet relate basically on two
teaching forms for the occasion,

36
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.570 
life lectures on campus and lecture hall,
in books and other documentation.

37
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.930 
the lectures are allowed interaction
between teacher and learner.

38
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.240 
and the books allowed to revise
content but without interaction.

39
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.840 
they were two
complimentary media.

40
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.600 
with the advent of the internet
the panorama gets richer.

41
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.950 
on the one hand, one can transmit the
lecture for online synchronous conception.

42
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.300 
and this synchronicity still allows
interaction between teacher learner

43
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.380 
with some appropriate textual
or video chat functionality.

44
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.500 
but you can also record the lecture
for asynchr lecture conception.

45
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.720 
in basic lectures, this videos direct
interaction is not possible anymore.

46
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.420 
and to complete the picture you
could also get the document

47
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.470 
by transcribing the lecture
with text and images.

48
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.230 
now it would not be reasonable to detect
any of these four forms a priori.

49
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.520 
they all have some positive
points. and may be the

50
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.610 
best fit for some
particular situation.

51
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.240 
so we'll probably see all
kinds of combinations.

52
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.570 
the high flex hybrid flexible
mode of teaching consists of

53
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.420 
allowing students to go to campus
to sit in person in the live

54
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.540 
lectures. or to view the lecture
online synchronously. or to

55
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.570 
view the recording
at a later moment.

56
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.890 
this allows for maximum flexibility,
therefore the name, high

57
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.690 
flex hybrid
and flexible

58
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.560 
on the other
hand, moocs are

59
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.840 
one very concrete instance
of online learning.

60
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.380 
and in this by no
means, the only one

61
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.410 
moocs started by following basically
the model of the traditional

62
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.840 
course at the
university.

63
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.870 
weekly lectures it problem sets
and semester-long courses.

64
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.580 
the main difference was that
everything was online.

65
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.630 
in what I call a
plesiochronous deliberate

66
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.930 
which is a significantly inside
each week. but with a single

67
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.670 
advance week by week.

68
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.590 
moocs slowly evolved away
from the on-campus model

69
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.880 
transitioning to shorter courses for
five weeks and adding self paced mode

70
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.790 
for greater learner
flexibility.

71
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.060 
and then they mingled with university
offerings with the direction

72
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.320 
of micro master and micro
bachelor programs.

73
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.740 
however there are many more
innovations in education technology.

74
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.350 
often promoted by start-ups which
give hints on future development.

75
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.420 
the movement is still traditional in
its conception and must evolve.

76
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.290 
it does not take into account all the
possibilities of modern technology.

77
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.470 
also the style and technical support
might need to be different

78
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.410 
depending on the
subject taught.

79
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.760 
for instance, to languages it might
be necessary to help retention.

80
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.210 
for instance like applying space repetition
techniques is doulingo leangues.

81
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.930 
or for math courses it might be
useful to use augmented reality

82
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.500 
tools that give hints on how to
solve handwritten equations

83
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.220 
like with photo math.

84
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.250 
of her stem courses may be interactions
like those proposed by fed simulations,

85
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.970 
might help in getting the
right understanding.

86
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.120 
or for other topics it might be useful
to follow a challenge based approach,

87
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.600 
like the one proposed
bright brilliant.

88
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.700 
or for business courses it might be necessary
to promote especially networking and events,

89
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.050 
like quantique which provides
also a mobile first approach.

90
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.200 
so we'll probably see combinations of
these different education delivery modes

91
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.860 
in several of
these forms.

92
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.250 
for instance some
readings for reflection

93
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.190 
followed by face to face interaction for
best networking and experimentation,

94
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.440 
followed by the production of
videos portraits by students etc.

95
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.590 
the expression possibilities are
rich. and we should be able

96
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.940 
to use whatever media is more
effective for each specific purpose.

97
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.540 
in summary the future of
education is bright.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.419 
I think we are ready to start.

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.559 
So, good

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.599 
evening to everybody in Europe.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.399 
Good morning or good afternoon for

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.319 
those of you who are following us

6
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.320 
from the US.

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.469 
I'm Carlos Alario-Hoyos, and I'm

8
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.299 
going to be the moderator

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.189 
of this panel whose

10
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.409 
title is Hybrid Learning

11
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.449 
and the Future of Teaching in Higher

12
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.679 
Education.

13
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.599 
Let me first

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.359 
share my screen and

15
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.279 
start introducing

16
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.949 
the panelists for today.

17
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.950 
So, this is

18
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.799 
the fourth panel in the future track

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.800 
of EMOOCs 2021.

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.894 
This panel

21
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.509 
will be lasting for about

22
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.669 
20 minutes and

23
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.439 
this is the second panel in the

24
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.089 
future track that deals with the

25
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.309 
topic of hybrid education,

26
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.579 
in this case, hybrid learning, after

27
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.529 
the panel that took place

28
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.299 
yesterday on the Transformation of

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.979 
the University towards a Hybrid

30
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.869 
University. So, we expect

31
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.909 
to address

32
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.799 
the topic of hybrid learning, maybe

33
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.119 
from a different angle with the

34
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.540 
panelists that we have today.

35
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.470 
So let me

36
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.219 
introduce the three great panelists

37
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.199 
that we have today, two of them come

38
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.969 
from Europe, the Netherlands, and

39
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.009 
Italy, and the third one comes from

40
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.359 
the United States.

41
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.479 
So, the first panelist is Dan

42
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.480 
Avida.

43
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.709 
He is the CEO and co-founder

44
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.710 
of Engageli,

45
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.739 
which is a digital learning

46
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.150 
platform that is

47
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.919 
designed to

48
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.989 
provide a kind of more active

49
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.359 
social collaborative environment,

50
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.729 
especially for a hybrid and

51
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.869 
online education.

52
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.909 
But he will tell us more about it.

53
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.149 
Then we have Susanna Sancassani,

54
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.389 
who is the managing director

55
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.255 
of METID, which is the Methods

00:01:59.256 --> 00:01:59.265 
and Innovative Technologies for learning office or unit at the

57
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.266 
Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

58
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.388 
And finally, we have Marja

59
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.399 
Verstelle, who is

60
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.949 
a senior project manager at

61
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.731 
LDE - Leiden, Delft, Erasmus

62
00:02:14.732 --> 00:02:15.732 
Universities

63
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.779 
in the Netherlands.

64
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.939 
So, let me tell you a little

65
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.309 
more about our panelists,

66
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.352 
starting with Dan Avida.

67
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.689 
He was also a partner

68
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.699 
at Opus Capital

69
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.979 
and he has been CEO of

70
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.379 
several companies, including

71
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.380 
the Decru.

72
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.189 
He was also co-founder of Decru, a

73
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.439 
story security company, also

74
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.779 
chairman and CEO of EFI,

75
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.549 
which is the Electronics for

76
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.919 
Imaging, and his background

77
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.989 
is in computer engineering

78
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.149 
from Technion, which is the Israel

79
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.580 
Institute of Technology.

80
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.819 
Then we have our

81
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.584 
second panelist, Susanna, who

82
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.489 
is also on the directive board

83
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.490 
of Societa Italiana di e-Learning.

84
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.639 
She has been a member of several

85
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.739 
scientific organizations,

86
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.929 
committees in relevant conferences

87
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.930 
such as the

88
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.829 
HEAd'21, ICED 2021 or Open

89
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.891 
Education Global in 2019.

90
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.839 
She's also the coordinator of a

91
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.209 
group on the quality of

92
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.069 
MOOCs organized

93
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.019 
by CRUI, which

94
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.699 
is the Conference of Italian

95
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.589 
University Directors, and

96
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.030 
she's also a lecturer at

97
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.490 
Politecnico di Milano in Italy.

98
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.639 
And our third panelist

99
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640 
is Marja Verstelle.

100
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.509 
So she has been or she has

101
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.969 
played several roles

102
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.769 
linked to Leiden University also in

103
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.729 
the past.

104
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.559 
Apart from her current

105
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.929 
roles including program manager

106
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.659 
in Digital Education Innovation,

107
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.639 
ICT in education, Deputy Head of

108
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.349 
the Department of Higher Education,

109
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.999 
Strategic Policy Adviser for the

110
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.469 
Vice-Rector of the Strategy and

111
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.929 
Academic Affairs Directorate.

112
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.789 
In the last year,

113
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.799 
she received the SURF Education

114
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.110 
Award for Innovation in Education.

115
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.109 
So this panel is about

116
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.969 
hybrid learning and the

117
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.528 
future of teaching in higher

118
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.398 
education.

119
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.559 
The first comment

120
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.419 
is about what

121
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.589 
do we mean by hybrid learning,

122
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.619 
considering that

123
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.509 
we all

124
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.519 
might have an idea of what we want

125
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.439 
to say or what we mean when we

126
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.489 
talk about hybrid learning.

127
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.099 
But there is even some discussion

128
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.719 
in the literature on the term

129
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.089 
hybrid.

130
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.499 
Hybrid is a combination of

131
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.359 
two or more different elements and

132
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.039 
two of the elements that have been

133
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.439 
combined are time and space.

134
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.953 
In some other cases,

135
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.059 
technology has also been the third

136
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.949 
element when talking about hybrid

137
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.879 
education.

138
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.709 
Basically in the case of time,

139
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.719 
we have synchronous and

140
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.439 
asynchronous education.

141
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.489 
And we have in the case of the space

142
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.279 
we have on-site and online education.

143
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.199 
So different or same

144
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.179 
space or time,

145
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.589 
and this can be combined in several

146
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.719 
ways. And in some of these cases,

147
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.579 
the literature talks about hybrid

148
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.499 
and other terms

149
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.729 
as well.

150
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.129 
For example, one

151
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.049 
of the terms that are commonly

152
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.369 
used is blended learning, which

153
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.199 
typically refers to asynchronous

154
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.809 
onsite

155
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.879 
class, plus the asynchronous

156
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.229 
online content other students

157
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.230 
follow.

158
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.919 
This idea has

159
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920 
also been

160
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.299 
also applied to the hybrid

161
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.300 
in some cases actually, uc3m

162
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.129 
ran several workshops

163
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.409 
in the past about hybrid education

164
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.389 
and the meaning there was

165
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.584 
to combining MOOC and MOOC-based

166
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.479 
technologies for residential

167
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.519 
education. So it was more on

168
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520 
this line.

169
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.149 
But there are other attempts and

170
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.039 
that can be

171
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.659 
used instead, for example,

172
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.399 
Bichronous referred to as online

173
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.379 
learning is a term that was

174
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.219 
recently published.

175
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.220 
I recently read it

176
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.699 
in reports some weeks ago.

177
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.949 
And in this case, we have the same

178
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.049 
space. So, we are

179
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.029 
online, we are learning

180
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.579 
online but then we combine

181
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.959 
two times, we combine the

182
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.909 
synchronous learning

183
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.269 
with the asynchronous learning

184
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.359 
benefiting from the best

185
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.310 
of each of these two worlds.

186
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.670 
And then

187
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.469 
we also have another term that

188
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.079 
we can hear now frequently,

189
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.369 
which is the HyFlex, which is a

190
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.019 
hybrid and flexible.

191
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.299 
In this case, the time is the same,

192
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.769 
but the space may be different.

193
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.059 
In this case, a student can choose

194
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.309 
whether to follow a course

195
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.469 
online or whether to go

196
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.419 
to the university and follow the

197
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.420 
course on-site.

198
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.309 
If we talk about hybrid learning,

199
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.139 
this concept was, I would say,

200
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.419 
was relatively new for

201
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.429 
some universities, at least for some

202
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.619 
professors, after

203
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.019 
the COVID pandemic arrived

204
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.909 
and many universities had

205
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.859 
to react to

206
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.079 
adapt or to adopt

207
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.669 
hybrid learning models.

208
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.629 
And in this adoption,

209
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.599 
a number of issues

210
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.549 
that the universities took

211
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.649 
care of, these are three

212
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.689 
of what we believe,

213
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.939 
I believe that are relevant

214
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.749 
issues.

215
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.429 
One is about the infrastructures and

216
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.319 
the technologies. So

217
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.269 
that means providing the appropriate

218
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.549 
equipment for the

219
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.379 
professors or educators and

220
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.329 
also having the appropriate

221
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.619 
equipment in the classroom,

222
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.479 
especially if the class is going

223
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.769 
to be streamed for those who are

224
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.770 
following it online. An

225
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.879 
other important issue are the

226
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.849 
methodology.

227
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.819 
So we are more and more used to

228
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.649 
having students

229
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.509 
into methodologies when we teach a

230
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.429 
class. So how we can

231
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.430 
also use

232
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.269 
student center methodologies to

233
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.129 
promote active learning when

234
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.719 
we have students that are physically

235
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.889 
in the classroom and some of those

236
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.389 
that are following it online and

237
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.819 
maybe some audience are watching the

238
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.979 
recording session afterwards

239
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.199 
and the students benefit from

240
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.179 
some activities that we

241
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.579 
can promote.

242
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.469 
And finally, and this is also

243
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.479 
very important, is about the

244
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.829 
competencies of that of the

245
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.869 
teachers, which

246
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.059 
definitely had to do an important

247
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.679 
effort during the pandemic to catch

248
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.659 
up and be able to

249
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.729 
continue with online classes

250
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.918 
or hybrid classes

251
00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.329 
for those who did not have previous

252
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.330 
experiences.

253
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.640 
So I have a

254
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.749 
set of driving questions

255
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.669 
for this panel, which can

256
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.460 
be taken or noted by the panelists,

257
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.919 
but that could help us introduce

258
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.889 
a topic. So the first one

259
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.039 
is related to what I said.

260
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.419 
What do you mean by hybrid learning

261
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.709 
when you're talking about hybrid

262
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.749 
educational hybrid learning

263
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.579 
is the future of higher education,

264
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.004 
the future of universities hybrid?

265
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.659 
What hybrid models

266
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.319 
will prevail at universities,

267
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320 
if they prevail, of course?

268
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.889 
Which infrastructures and

269
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.719 
technologies are best suited for

270
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.720 
hybrid learning

271
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.869 
regarding the competencies of

272
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.789 
teachers and also students, what are

273
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.129 
these competencies that are

274
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.419 
more appropriate for hybrid

275
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.589 
learning?

276
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.779 
How can we promote active learning

277
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.339 
as to the center education and

278
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.199 
hybrid learning in how to

279
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.419 
facilitate this smooth transition

280
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.669 
that many universities are now

281
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.589 
struggling with to go

282
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.329 
to hybrid learning in hybrid

283
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.330 
education?

284
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.959 
So that's all for the

285
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.639 
introduction. So we're going to

286
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.709 
start with the three panelists

287
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.749 
in this order,

288
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.069 
we're going to have about 50

289
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.519 
minute presentations, three,

290
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.409 
15 minute presentations, and then

291
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.629 
we will have time for discussion.

292
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.459 
So please leave your

293
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.289 
questions in the chat and we

294
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.549 
will very likely discuss

295
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.710 
after the presentation,

296
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.429 
So that's all

297
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.489 
on my side for this introduction,

298
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.529 
and I would like you to please

299
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.479 
welcome Dan Avida our

300
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.444 
first speaker.

301
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.359 
I begin by

302
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.789 
talking a bit about

303
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.099 
what led us to start this

304
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.479 
company.

305
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.029 
So about

306
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.829 
a year and a quarter ago, Silicon

307
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.259 
Valley went into lockdown

308
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.179 
and my wife and

309
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.009 
I were suddenly faced

310
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.689 
with two teenage daughters who were

311
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.329 
attending school on Zoom.

312
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.159 
Now, an important note to make is

313
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.409 
that my wife is definitely a coder,

314
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.959 
is co-founder of Coursera,

315
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.549 
and that was on the board of

316
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.229 
Coursera from when we started the

317
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.489 
company. And that was definitely I

318
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.319 
got off the board about

319
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.209 
two years ago and we were candidly

320
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.999 
shocked to see how bad

321
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.949 
the experience was for our daughters

322
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.409 
who attend a very good

323
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.819 
local high school here in Silicon

324
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.829 
Valley. And so we teamed

325
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.419 
up with a very long time

326
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.609 
collaborator of Daphne's and mine,

327
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.379 
Serge Plotkin, like Daphne was for

328
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.329 
many years a professor

329
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.739 
at Stanford.

330
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.719 
And that is what led us to

331
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.249 
start engaging.

332
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.289 
So Carlos opened

333
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.132 
by talking about what this hybrid

334
00:11:24.133 --> 00:11:25.919 
mean in the context of education,

335
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.809 
but hybrid is not just an education

336
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.569 
now, it's also in the workforce.

337
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.939 
These statistics

338
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.100 
came from Robert Half

339
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.105 
Survey. Robert Half is a leading HR

340
00:11:37.106 --> 00:11:38.106 
company

341
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.209 
here in the US.

342
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.069 
And to be the most

343
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.779 
striking is that one-third of

344
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.759 
employees are forced to go back full

345
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760 
time to the office.

346
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.479 
And that is

347
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.369 
actually a very strong statement,

348
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.869 
even with the recovering economy.

349
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.439 
And you could see that the majority

350
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.659 
of the employees do want

351
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.639 
some kind of hybrid

352
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.769 
type or even fully remote

353
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.839 
type work moving forward.

354
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.879 
And as far as we can tell,

355
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.979 
the same seems to be true for

356
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.069 
students as well as for

357
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.269 
professors.

358
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.219 
And you can see in

359
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.929 
this survey over here, which I'm

360
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.579 
sure many we've seen from the

361
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.469 
Digital Learning Post survey,

362
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.509 
73 percent of

363
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.579 
students want to

364
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.409 
take at least some online

365
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.629 
courses as well

366
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.190 
as hybrid courses.

367
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.079 
So, again, when we started the

368
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.969 
company about

369
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.949 
15 months ago, we tried

370
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.499 
to imagine what would

371
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.479 
we need in order to

372
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.489 
gear the environment

373
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.679 
towards student success,

374
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.169 
and we

375
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.299 
have four main attributes

376
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.309 
that we think are super important.

377
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.659 
The first is active learning.

378
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.269 
So the students staring at a screen.

379
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.619 
One thing I forgot to mention is

380
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.299 
that our two daughters took them

381
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.159 
about an hour to figure out how to

382
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.749 
get around paying attention to

383
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.699 
class. One of them was spending

384
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.799 
their time upping her skill

385
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.239 
in a variety of different computer

386
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.559 
games, and the other was watching

387
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.459 
Netflix.

388
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.349 
And so just having an

389
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.359 
instructor talk in front of a TV

390
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.309 
camera is not engaging.

391
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.179 
That's one of the things I

392
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.679 
definitely realized many years ago

393
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.219 
when she started work at Stanford

394
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.489 
that led to Coursera.

395
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.439 
The second is that

396
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.969 
it really has to be active and

397
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.799 
engaging as well as

398
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.119 
flexible.

399
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.769 
Carlos, I thought that was really

400
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.569 
interesting, Carlos, that you had

401
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.819 
the theory of relativity

402
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.739 
together with unifying the space and

403
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.029 
time over here.

404
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.129 
So we believe that education does

405
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.809 
have to be flexible in both space

406
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:46.679 
and time.

407
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.349 
And students are not interested

408
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.479 
in losing the social aspect

409
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.319 
of learning.

410
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.479 
And it's good for outcomes.

411
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.159 
It's also good for emotional

412
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.089 
well-being.

413
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.339 
And so we try to capture

414
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.889 
and actually enhance that

415
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.749 
when we were imagining what is

416
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.750 
required.

417
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.259 
As we started talking to

418
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.599 
professors throughout

419
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.010 
the world.

420
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.819 
What we heard is that professors are

421
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.129 
very, very focused on

422
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.189 
engagement.

423
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.069 
They do not want to talk

424
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.259 
to a bunch of students

425
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.459 
that have turned off the camera,

426
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.989 
turned off their mic and have a

427
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.219 
pretty good idea that these students

428
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.389 
are probably not paying attention.

429
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.389 
The other thing is, I mean, this was

430
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.609 
highly accelerated in the US

431
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.649 
last year because of George

432
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.569 
Floyd, but the whole issue

433
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.429 
of diversity, equity

434
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.409 
and so on,

435
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.359 
and they do not want anybody to

436
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.399 
feel excluded.

437
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.289 
Managing a class that's

438
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.209 
hybrid is difficult.

439
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.309 
Stanford has been running hybrid

440
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.139 
classes back from

441
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.969 
the 80s using one-way

442
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.749 
video feeds.

443
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.579 
It is very difficult to do,

444
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.959 
especially at the time that they had

445
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.639 
no way to see the students or the

446
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.559 
students would ask a question

447
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.789 
or most of it was completely

448
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.679 
disembodied voice coming through

449
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.909 
a speaker phone.

450
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:06.899 
The students could see the

451
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.570 
instructors, but not back.

452
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.029 
And lastly, it is

453
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.919 
important to keep the sense

454
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.749 
of community alive and well.

455
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.939 
Now, as we talked about, Sam,

456
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.129 
like employees, students

457
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.509 
want flexibility, they want to

458
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.769 
continue collaborating with other

459
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.779 
students, and they

460
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.339 
also want to be engaged.

461
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.629 
They do not want to be bored.

462
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.869 
So classrooms are becoming very

463
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.160 
rapidly global.

464
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.969 
We have a bunch of partners that

465
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.019 
throughout the world that are

466
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.579 
teaching students in other parts of

467
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.589 
the world to know more

468
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.659 
that a student

469
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.849 
is only attending

470
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.340 
university in their local community.

471
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.039 
You can see in the US the

472
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.019 
acceleration of the very large

473
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.849 
online or partly

474
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.009 
online universities like, as you

475
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.869 
know, University of Maryland global

476
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.119 
campus that are attracting students

477
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.619 
from throughout the U.S.

478
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.789 
and in some cases from throughout

479
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.790 
the world.

480
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.919 
Again, we talked about inclusivity.

481
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.799 
It's very important to make

482
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.569 
sure that students are welcome and

483
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.379 
heard.

484
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.269 
The teaching

485
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.189 
has to be more and more

486
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.069 
data-driven and

487
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.479 
Daphne was working at Stanford for

488
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.309 
years on

489
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.049 
the intersection of artificial

490
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.909 
intelligence and

491
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.229 
medical science.

492
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.849 
And she heard this term

493
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.249 
evidence-based medicine.

494
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.629 
And for as an engineer, as a

495
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.889 
computer scientist, it was kind of

496
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.779 
used that most medicine is not

497
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.339 
evidence-based.

498
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.899 
So we believe that education needs

499
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.849 
to be evidence-based as well,

500
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.679 
not just what people think should

501
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.659 
work, but we can track and figure

502
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.769 
out what works.

503
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.869 
And lastly,

504
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.089 
everybody is under financial strain.

505
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.189 
And so we are gearing

506
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.199 
what we're providing to actually

507
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200 
reduce costs.

508
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.159 
So all these modalities, that Carlos

509
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.409 
talked about, do require new

510
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.539 
platforms and new learning

511
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.578 
environments. This is a screenshot

512
00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.108 
of the engagement platform.

513
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.858 
And it's geared

514
00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.959 
to provide students with a good

515
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.039 
path forward.

516
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.739 
So we track students progress.

517
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.568 
We use that in

518
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.399 
order to provide them with what they

519
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.348 
need in order to progress

520
00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.299 
social and peer learning

521
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.588 
we saw in Coursera.

522
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.149 
If students are taking a course

523
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.099 
together, their retention rate

524
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.629 
is in many cases, an order of

525
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.309 
magnitude 10x better.

526
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.439 
So the sense

527
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.529 
of community is very reinforcing.

528
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.149 
Engagement is important.

529
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.009 
And lastly, as Carlos said,

530
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.939 
it's important to provide

531
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.979 
flexibility and space and time.

532
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.109 
Today, many, many people are working

533
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.309 
while they're studying.

534
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.169 
And you need to allow

535
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.879 
them to learn when they can, not

536
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.769 
just when the class is being run.

537
00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.809 
So the topic of this panel

538
00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.669 
is hybrid learning, what you're

539
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.499 
seeing over here is how we

540
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.559 
currently envision it.

541
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.439 
The students listed on the left are

542
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.909 
the ones that are in person.

543
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.439 
The ones in the middle of the screen

544
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.849 
are the remote students.

545
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.399 
The in-person students interact

546
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.619 
with every

547
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.599 
student using either

548
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.459 
a laptop or what

549
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.899 
you can see on the top right here, a

550
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.369 
handheld device.

551
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.279 
And one of the things we do is

552
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.289 
allow the remote students to clearly

553
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.809 
hear the in-person students simply

554
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.748 
by some sophisticated

555
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.429 
digital signal processing we do

556
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.169 
to make sure that the studio is

557
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.999 
currently speaking in class is

558
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.949 
clearly heard by the remote

559
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.029 
students. We basically take

560
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.009 
advantage of the fact that every

561
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.689 
student today has a handheld device

562
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.309 
that has a good microphone in it.

563
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.289 
And so we basically amplify

564
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.775 
the audio from that particular

565
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.929 
device or mute everybody else,

566
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.279 
this way the remote students can

567
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.109 
very clearly hear the discussion

568
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.009 
in person and vice versa.

569
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.979 
Another thing is,

570
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.190 
again, to quote

571
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.569 
Heinlein that "never learned from a

572
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.950 
man who agreed with them",

573
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.949 
we basically fostered

574
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.209 
an environment where students with

575
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.099 
different points of view are put in

576
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.629 
learning pods that they can

577
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.209 
basically argue about

578
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.229 
different topics.

579
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.939 
What you can see over here as we use

580
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.619 
the results of the quiz or poll to

581
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.629 
automatically separate students

582
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.119 
into separate tables or learning

583
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.049 
pods where they can have a

584
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.240 
meaningful conversation.

585
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.899 
And we do provide analytics for

586
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.849 
both students, as well as

587
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.799 
for the instructor,

588
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.415 
what you can see over here, is a

589
00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:38.469 
talktime indicator that we're

590
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.309 
working on.

591
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.409 
So the students,

592
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.449 
this spiderweb, those

593
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.429 
blue dots, give a student indication

594
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.349 
of how much they've spoken in a

595
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.389 
given session just to

596
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.130 
basically reinforce equity.

597
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.509 
As I was mentioning, Stanford has

598
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.429 
been experimenting with that back,

599
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.439 
actually, this particular paper

600
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.299 
was written by Jim

601
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.919 
Gibbons, who was Dean of Engineering

602
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.839 
at Stanford in the 90s.

603
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.849 
He wrote that paper in the 70s.

604
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.139 
And you can see over here very

605
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.449 
interesting statistics.

606
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.139 
So this is very early hybrid

607
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.219 
education.

608
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.819 
So this was a class that

609
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.419 
Dean Gibbons was teaching at

610
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.369 
Stanford, and you could see 300

611
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.469 
students on campus, the TV

612
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.239 
students, what today we would be

613
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.649 
calling a hybrid.

614
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.899 
So Stanford had microwave

615
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.789 
links that were beaming

616
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.559 
the classes over to various

617
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.489 
employers.

618
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.510 
And you could see that

619
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.569 
the academic achievement of these

620
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.129 
students that were not in class,

621
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.989 
that really had no good way

622
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.069 
to interact with other students,

623
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.279 
with the professor, was definitely

624
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.829 
less than the ones in class.

625
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.079 
And where it says, "Video No

626
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.659 
Tutor", these were students

627
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.029 
that just got basically a cassette

628
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.769 
of the recording of the class.

629
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.809 
On the far right, you see

630
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.369 
remote students that happened to be

631
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.199 
not Stanford students.

632
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.879 
These were employees of your Packard

633
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.859 
and the city that north

634
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.409 
of San Francisco, they had the best

635
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.569 
outcome and of everybody,

636
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.309 
including all of the class students.

637
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.469 
And the reason why they did is

638
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.119 
Stanford would send over a student,

639
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.469 
not necessarily even a teaching

640
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.369 
assistant with a cassette of

641
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.979 
the class, and they would simply

642
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.569 
stop the playback of the recording

643
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.249 
of the class every few minutes and

644
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.139 
foster a conversation.

645
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.759 
And you could see that these

646
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.289 
students actually did the best of

647
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.149 
this particular class.

648
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.589 
So we have created this environment

649
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.149 
without requiring anybody to travel

650
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:30.929 
with video cassettes.

651
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:31.979 
We actually don't think anybody

652
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.059 
today has a VCR.

653
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.079 
Actually, even somebody showed up

654
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.581 
with a cassette and nobody would be

655
00:21:35.582 --> 00:21:36.539 
able to play it.

656
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.309 
But what you're seeing over here on

657
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.899 
the right is a group of students who

658
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.459 
are viewing synchronously with

659
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.409 
respect to each other a

660
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.219 
recorded class.

661
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.689 
But obviously, the class is

662
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.919 
asynchronous with respect

663
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.679 
to when the instructor was giving

664
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.749 
it. So whether Carlos was saying

665
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.729 
is this flexibility of space and

666
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.730 
time.

667
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.209 
And one of the things again today,

668
00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.649 
you can basically bring instructors

669
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.479 
from all over the world, similar to

670
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.499 
how today we're having this session.

671
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.169 
It's very important for the students

672
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.609 
to have a clear understanding of who

673
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.899 
the instructor is, who we do

674
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.939 
support, having this ability

675
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.950 
of remote control instructors.

676
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.429 
And again, students and instructors

677
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.499 
are not interested in being

678
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.089 
system integrators and having a

679
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.859 
bunch of different software packages

680
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.689 
that they have to work with,

681
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.669 
and again, the cognitive load on

682
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.239 
instructors and students is high.

683
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.819 
So we try to simplify it as much as

684
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.959 
possible.

685
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.609 
This is one example.

686
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.399 
We facilitate quizzes and polls

687
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.259 
that are driven simply

688
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.439 
from the PowerPoint presentation

689
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.869 
or from a keynote presentation, for

690
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:40.979 
PDF we don't care.

691
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.159 
We basically automatically generate

692
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.079 
based on certain stickers,

693
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.089 
if you will, that are put in the

694
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.639 
PDF or the slide deck, a

695
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.619 
poll or quiz that can be used

696
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.380 
for academic purposes.

697
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.719 
And lastly,

698
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.369 
again, we measure a lot of data

699
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.439 
points, but we leave it up to the

700
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.749 
educators and instructors to

701
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.159 
blend all these different

702
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.109 
measurements, to come up with

703
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.419 
some indicator that's useful for the

704
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.309 
instructor to have

705
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.629 
a sense of what's going on in the

706
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.630 
classroom.

707
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.729 
So thank you very much for your

708
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.730 
attention.

709
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.779 
Thank you very much, Dan, for

710
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.759 
your presentation and for

711
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.649 
presenting engaged

712
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.599 
in and the great features of this

713
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.489 
platform to the

714
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.490 
audience.

715
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.119 
We're going to continue

716
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.909 
with the second panelist,

717
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.949 
in this case, Susanna.

718
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.359 
So, the floor is all yours.

719
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.360 
Thank you, Carlos.

720
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.479 
Hi, everybody.

721
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.970 
I'm very happy that

722
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.179 
tonight we are here

723
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.009 
with an interesting

724
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.989 
number of participants is

725
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.089 
not the Salvias after

726
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.769 
two days of work.

727
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.809 
So I am very happy

728
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:01.939 
to see you tonight.

729
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.069 
I'm going to share

730
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.930 
my screen in order

731
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.820 
to

732
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.319 
use some

733
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.390 
slides that can help me.

734
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.139 
So I am the managing director

735
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.239 
of METID that's the

736
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.559 
Teaching Learning Center of

737
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.259 
Polytecnico Milano in Italy.

738
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.719 
And what's about

739
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.030 
hybrid learning in our experience.

740
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.959 
This time we have discovered

741
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.239 
the practice before

742
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.339 
the theory.

743
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.340 
The practice

744
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.839 
has been accelerated

745
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.150 
very much in

746
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.029 
last month so in the last year.

747
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.099 
So we had a very

748
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.949 
interesting experience to practice

749
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.349 
model that

750
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.350 
we were

751
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.759 
designing from a theoretical

752
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.739 
point of view in a very, very

753
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.879 
general way.

754
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.209 
I can start with

755
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.099 
my personal experience here.

756
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.289 
You can see half

757
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.249 
of my class of

758
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.939 
PhD students who

759
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.620 
are teaching digitally.

760
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.269 
And here you can

761
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.424 
see some other

762
00:25:22.425 --> 00:25:24.739 
students and the other half that

763
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.689 
were physically in

764
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.159 
the classroom.

765
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.349 
And me, I was

766
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.599 
online since I

767
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.269 
had problems

768
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.609 
and some health issues

769
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.079 
and I couldn't

770
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.039 
stay with a student in the

771
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.019 
classroom during the last

772
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.020 
month.

773
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.469 
So this was

774
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.839 
the configuration of

775
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.279 
my last course.

776
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.919 
I was online some students

777
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.049 
in the classroom and some

778
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.029 
others online,

779
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.919 
all of distributed all

780
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.899 
over the world because they went

781
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.539 
home because of

782
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.909 
the pandemic's situation.

783
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.579 
And so we

784
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.529 
decided that even if I

785
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.109 
was online, we

786
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.549 
decided to

787
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.849 
involve any students

788
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.349 
in a face to face

789
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.519 
teaching and learning experience.

790
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.109 
Since we think that

791
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.049 
the relationships and

792
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.999 
the exchanges that have students

793
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.279 
cannot build together

794
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.229 
are very, very important

795
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.259 
and perhaps more important

796
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.179 
than the relationship

797
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.380 
of the teacher

798
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:44.850 
in that

799
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.899 
it is not

800
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.119 
always the more

801
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.039 
relevant part of the

802
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.869 
relationship so that you

803
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.759 
need to develop before developing

804
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.829 
a very interesting

805
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.509 
teaching-learning experience.

806
00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.510 
So we have

807
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.379 
experience of this situation,

808
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.380 
of teaching-learning

809
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.779 
sector, and

810
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.699 
everybody was working

811
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.889 
together, both online

812
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.199 
or in presence, using

813
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.539 
that as a common

814
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.369 
space, MIRO,

815
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.769 
in this case, you can see

816
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.770 
a large

817
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.929 
digital border

818
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.759 
where each group

819
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.999 
has his own

820
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.680 
space and

821
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.429 
where all of the students

822
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.829 
were sharing their

823
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.999 
results.

824
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.009 
And at the same

825
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.869 
in the same way

826
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.059 
if they were online

827
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.609 
or in a presence

828
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.469 
in order to be able to

829
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.199 
discuss it, to give feedback

830
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.299 
and to share a

831
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.520 
feedback with the whole

832
00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.000 
community of the students.

833
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.019 
So this was a great opportunity

834
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.490 
to put in place

835
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.569 
our theoretical

836
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.519 
approaches of the approach that

837
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.109 
is based on the PSD

838
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.110 
model,

839
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.959 
pedagogy, spaces and technology.

840
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.749 
So the idea that it's

841
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.699 
needed in order to

842
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.249 
create a supportive

843
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.859 
environment for effective

844
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.959 
teaching-learning experiences is

845
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.279 
that needed to create

846
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.880 
a very deep integration

847
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.869 
pedagogical aspects,

848
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.069 
spaces and technology.

849
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.079 
Particularly for a hybrid

850
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.719 
learning classroom

851
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.729 
need to be equipped

852
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.589 
with high

853
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.719 
level audio-video system,

854
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.999 
very well integrated with a virtual

855
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.919 
classroom, usable

856
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.869 
both by

857
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.629 
students in the classroom and

858
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.859 
remotely.

859
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.989 
And moreover,

860
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.919 
we have experience

861
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920 
that is

862
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.529 
needed to support teachers

863
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.269 
in designing these new

864
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.379 
kinds of teaching

865
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.239 
and learning experiences that

866
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.349 
can integrate

867
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.319 
MOOCs life interactions

868
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.899 
in the classroom online

869
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.819 
at the same time or

870
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.670 
in different times.

871
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.209 
And

872
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.159 
then I'll

873
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.049 
see that they

874
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.119 
don't reference

875
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.079 
paradigm when we are talking about

876
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.209 
technological support,

877
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.729 
is based on the idea

878
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.730 
that

879
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.499 
lectures are a Transmissive

880
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.479 
and synchronous

881
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.849 
and possibly

882
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.739 
with smaller classrooms.

883
00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.629 
So if you are going towards a new

884
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.459 
models with

885
00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.559 
active classroom that perhaps

886
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.839 
are also be the classrooms,

887
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.909 
it's not so

888
00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.129 
easy to find the

889
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.629 
technological support.

890
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:18.710 
So that can

891
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.359 
be effective in this situation.

892
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.810 
We have just

893
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.399 
seen engagingly and

894
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400 
how

895
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.049 
the new vision

896
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.179 
can go in this direction.

897
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.549 
But they

898
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.439 
are not

899
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.299 
exactly alone

900
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.019 
in this new direction.

901
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.009 
But we can find

902
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.019 
just a very few

903
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.059 
number of actors

904
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.309 
that are providing

905
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.559 
technological support for

906
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.779 
active hybrid,

907
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.509 
larger classroom

908
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.839 
and better.

909
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.840 
And

910
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.920 
we see that

911
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.469 
technology is accelerating

912
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.999 
across all the directions.

913
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.859 
For example, we

914
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.439 
have tested this, addressing

915
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.440 
a system that

916
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.329 
allows us to

917
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.330 
blur the

918
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.289 
teacher and we

919
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.409 
have an artificial intelligence

920
00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:28.949 
system.

921
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.069 
It allows the

922
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.199 
remote students to see

923
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.599 
very well the blackboard.

924
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.909 
And even if it's

925
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.069 
covered by the teacher,

926
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.989 
by reconstructing

927
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.760 
digitally the

928
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.779 
blackboard around the teacher

929
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.759 
is moving or

930
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.589 
for example,

931
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.590 
the

932
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.889 
teacher tracking a

933
00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.929 
video said that are able

934
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.819 
to follow the teacher he

935
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.219 
for he is or she is

936
00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.649 
moving in a very large

937
00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.689 
even if she's moving or in

938
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.269 
a very large space

939
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.489 
or more of a very interesting

940
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.529 
system so that are able

941
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.139 
to capture

942
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.630 
and translate live

943
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.449 
text of the teacher.

944
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.489 
You see, these

945
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.229 
all are very, very interesting

946
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.959 
things about all the focus,

947
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.209 
about the teacher, how

948
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.399 
we can support the teacher.

949
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.619 
A very small

950
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.330 
attention is

951
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.629 
devoted to our students

952
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.349 
and to support

953
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.229 
the interaction among the students

954
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.599 
in for giving

955
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.549 
them a space

956
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.069 
in active

957
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.240 
extended learning.

958
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.539 
But we think that this is not

959
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.489 
just a

960
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.929 
problem of technology.

961
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.629 
As we have seen, systems

962
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.549 
like engaging

963
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.679 
in real life

964
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.299 
will arise in the market.

965
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.650 
So we will be able

966
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.889 
to use it for

967
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.849 
supporting more active

968
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.769 
teachers learning experiences

969
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.599 
that also in an ideal

970
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.009 
situation.

971
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.929 
But we have also to

972
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.459 
rethink our

973
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.449 
design and models

974
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.339 
in a way that

975
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.609 
take can take into account

976
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.049 
that we are

977
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.910 
really in

978
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.169 
a systemic situation

979
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.479 
in which each part

980
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.299 
of the learning

981
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.149 
activity is very strong,

982
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.489 
very deeply related

983
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.479 
with the other.

984
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.579 
So I can show

985
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.249 
you, for example, in this a very

986
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.039 
simple model

987
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.359 
that if I

988
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.070 
make

989
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.169 
a larger

990
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.178 
situation in

991
00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.399 
which there is

992
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.399 
interactivity between actors,

993
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.619 
I have a reduction

994
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.539 
of situations

995
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.800 
that are

996
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.489 
less interactive.

997
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.369 
So I have to

998
00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.809 
design all the

999
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.979 
dimensions of the learning

1000
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.119 
experience.

1001
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.499 
That's why we have

1002
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.860 
developed a new

1003
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.320 
design

1004
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.769 
model that we call is

1005
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.420 
Smart Learning Design 25.

1006
00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.569 
25 because we think

1007
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.429 
that now it's really

1008
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.199 
needed when we are in

1009
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.259 
the hybrid situation,

1010
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.280 
it's needed

1011
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.089 
to design

1012
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:12.199 
all of the

1013
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.039 
25 hours that are related

1014
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040 
to the

1015
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.910 
university credit

1016
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.169 
of a student

1017
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.119 
by exploring

1018
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.369 
all of the science, all

1019
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.519 
of the learning experience,

1020
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.349 
the interactive content collection,

1021
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.579 
the frontal contextualization,

1022
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.999 
the production, the investigation,

1023
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.649 
the content transformation,

1024
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:42.979 
practice and experience of the

1025
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.799 
retrieval of information,

1026
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.649 
the discussion and also

1027
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.749 
the activity, all the reflection

1028
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.639 
and make that connection.

1029
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.359 
So in order to support

1030
00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.860 
teachers that in

1031
00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.799 
this design, we

1032
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.800 
have developed

1033
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.359 
a visual methodology

1034
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.519 
in which they can

1035
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.679 
try to see the learning

1036
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.719 
experience from the point of view

1037
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.939 
of the students

1038
00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.769 
and to

1039
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:16.770 
build in

1040
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.469 
a complete design

1041
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.979 
that can

1042
00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.109 
go in deeper in each week

1043
00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.489 
of the semester

1044
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:32.179 
by proposing

1045
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.040 
different approaches

1046
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.369 
that can be both

1047
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.439 
a face to face

1048
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.539 
or extended classroom,

1049
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.749 
synchronous online, asynchronous

1050
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:47.029 
or asynchronous in extra time

1051
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.249 
after the end of

1052
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.250 
the semester.

1053
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.869 
So this is the

1054
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.729 
direction in which we

1055
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:58.189 
will try to support

1056
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.139 
all our teachers in

1057
00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.059 
order to make them able to

1058
00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.979 
use all

1059
00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.980 
the

1060
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.919 
channels and all the opportunities

1061
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.289 
provided by blended learning.

1062
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:14.424 
And hybrid

1063
00:37:14.425 --> 00:37:16.549 
flexible learning for

1064
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.829 
which you get intended learning

1065
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.689 
outcomes in

1066
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.639 
an integrated way.

1067
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.689 
And we think that it's really

1068
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.570 
something that

1069
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.689 
could be able to change

1070
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.819 
in our

1071
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.019 
university

1072
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.259 
practice in

1073
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.209 
teaching and learning.

1074
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.519 
And we think that is

1075
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.499 
now is not to for

1076
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.749 
the future because we have

1077
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.729 
already experienced it something

1078
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.739 
like that in last

1079
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.009 
month. Now is the time

1080
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.439 
to learn

1081
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.160 
to revise the

1082
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.749 
lessons and to

1083
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.579 
organize a new

1084
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.739 
model for the future.

1085
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.179 
Thank you very much.

1086
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.369 
Thank you very much, Susanna, for

1087
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:11.309 
your presentation and also for

1088
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.184 
your Smart Learning

1089
00:38:13.185 --> 00:38:15.038 
Design 25

1090
00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:16.889 
model supporting teachers in

1091
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.890 
higher learning.

1092
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.759 
I would like to remind the audience

1093
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.529 
that you can leave your questions in

1094
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.479 
a chat and we will

1095
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.639 
try to address these questions after

1096
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.319 
the presentation of our third

1097
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.320 
speaker.

1098
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.979 
So, Marija, the

1099
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.659 
floor is all yours.

1100
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.449 
I would like to start with a

1101
00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.399 
story of a wake-up call

1102
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.739 
and explain what I understood

1103
00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.629 
by hybrid teaching or what I

1104
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.459 
understand, which

1105
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.320 
could be different from the others.

1106
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.009 
Then I would

1107
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.929 
like to look at two

1108
00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.899 
scenarios for post lockdown.

1109
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.879 
So we've been hearing a lot about

1110
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.649 
during lockdown.

1111
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.509 
I think it's wonderful what

1112
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.489 
I've heard so far,

1113
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.349 
but for starters, I foresee

1114
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.629 
a black and the bright possible

1115
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.579 
scenario. So

1116
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.829 
that's what I will be talking

1117
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:11.830 
about.

1118
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.669 
And a wake-up call was

1119
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.929 
about a year ago

1120
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.630 
when the

1121
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.989 
lockdown started,

1122
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.179 
my team and I, who had been

1123
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.249 
building MOOCs and online education

1124
00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.739 
for 8 years,

1125
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.749 
we thought, we know

1126
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:32.639 
what teachers need, what

1127
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.449 
students need.

1128
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.249 
We know what makes good online

1129
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.899 
education.

1130
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.419 
We know how to make good video

1131
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.379 
clips.

1132
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.509 
We know how to organize online

1133
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.759 
communities, online discussion

1134
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.760 
forums.

1135
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.599 
And I was invited by a

1136
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.615 
faculty dean of Innovative,

1137
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.829 
he's innovative.

1138
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.869 
His faculty still

1139
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:56.849 
wasn't as innovative as he would

1140
00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.139 
like.

1141
00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.089 
And he said, this

1142
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:01.589 
is a great opportunity.

1143
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.900 
This situation never

1144
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.159 
lose. What's the word?

1145
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.160 
Never..

1146
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.839 
that you have to use this

1147
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.179 
kind of situations,

1148
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.609 
also the opportunities it creates.

1149
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:20.399 
So he asked me to

1150
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.889 
propose how we could develop

1151
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.199 
a lot of blended

1152
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.849 
online education.

1153
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.799 
And I started I talk

1154
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.419 
to a lot of people start planning.

1155
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.819 
And then we had a panel conversation

1156
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.559 
with students.

1157
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.839 
And that was my wake up call

1158
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.819 
because the students were two

1159
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.229 
months into

1160
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.729 
the pandemic situation of

1161
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.679 
online education and what

1162
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.059 
they told me was something

1163
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.189 
completely different than

1164
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.049 
what I found

1165
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.999 
out what makes a good

1166
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.339 
MOOC a good online education.

1167
00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.169 
They found two teachers who showed

1168
00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.949 
up or who put in the elements

1169
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.159 
of video clips

1170
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.369 
either found on the Internet

1171
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.199 
or made themselves

1172
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.149 
that that was kind of cheap form

1173
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.739 
of education.

1174
00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.359 
And I asked do you know how much

1175
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.279 
work it takes for a teacher

1176
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.079 
to make such a video?

1177
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.080 
And

1178
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.489 
they said, yes, but what I want

1179
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.689 
is the connection.

1180
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.309 
They want to feel the connection.

1181
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.289 
And they wanted to feel

1182
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.209 
that the teacher knew how

1183
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.039 
hard it was for them and

1184
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.169 
that they didn't understand.

1185
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.669 
And I thought, yeah, but you don't

1186
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.039 
want just one hour

1187
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.199 
sessions where you have to watch

1188
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.810 
that. We had

1189
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.869 
at that time, we had called TuRa.

1190
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.791 
We couldn't use

1191
00:41:44.792 --> 00:41:46.739 
Zoom, we didn't have

1192
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:47.519 
any students yet?

1193
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.859 
And it was all kind of difficult

1194
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.989 
to manage and the technology

1195
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.789 
didn't work well, but they didn't

1196
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.549 
care, they wanted the connection.

1197
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.639 
So it's

1198
00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.489 
different, I think, from

1199
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.349 
what the research had

1200
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.209 
then mentioned where students

1201
00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.519 
say they want online learning.

1202
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.069 
That's what they told me.

1203
00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.919 
So this made

1204
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.920 
me think

1205
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680 
and

1206
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:16.939 
let me go to

1207
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.079 
hybrid teaching in the Netherlands

1208
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.879 
at least, hybrid teaching is only

1209
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.739 
one thing that's if you have one

1210
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.659 
group partly present, partly

1211
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.879 
online. So you've seen that also

1212
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.639 
in the presentation of Susanna and

1213
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.569 
then.

1214
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.119 
And I had some experience

1215
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.050 
when we organized virtual

1216
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:36.930 
exchange where

1217
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.739 
our own students could follow

1218
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.709 
courses abroad

1219
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.259 
at another university online.

1220
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.749 
So that was far before Corona.

1221
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.639 
And we had some teachers who want

1222
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.529 
to do this in a hybrid form.

1223
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.389 
So their own students in class

1224
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.939 
and the other students

1225
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.889 
abroad and we didn't find any form

1226
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:58.879 
that worked.

1227
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.709 
Maybe if we would have the

1228
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.879 
forms that Susanna had described

1229
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.769 
then it would have

1230
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.349 
been better, but it didn't work

1231
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.349 
with all the disadvantages

1232
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:10.350 
that you know.

1233
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.029 
So but well, hey, you

1234
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.829 
have to keep experimenting, right?

1235
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.689 
So I'm

1236
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.039 
asking around all the time.

1237
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.169 
And there was one positive example

1238
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.049 
that I heard about the other day

1239
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:25.489 
that is more recent.

1240
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.490 
It's from

1241
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.509 
like a month ago, which was

1242
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.650 
this example of

1243
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.799 
a group where they organized

1244
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.479 
a hybrid learning.

1245
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.279 
And it was it's still the example

1246
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.629 
that was positive for the

1247
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.730 
evaluations were positive

1248
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.719 
from what I heard, from experience

1249
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.739 
of other people. Right.

1250
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.599 
So what you see here is kind

1251
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.969 
of a theater. It's very intimate.

1252
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.859 
There are 15 chairs and you see

1253
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.259 
it's kind of lounging chairs.

1254
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.849 
The students must feel like they're

1255
00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:56.779 
treated.

1256
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.609 
They get a preferred

1257
00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:59.610 
treatment.

1258
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.599 
You see the video wall and the

1259
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.119 
teacher, the teachers

1260
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.219 
who work with this were involved

1261
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.409 
in the design of the setting.

1262
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.579 
And they also redesigned

1263
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.759 
their education to apply.

1264
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.289 
And it works. Apparently, its

1265
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.239 
students say there was one

1266
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.099 
student who said, I've never

1267
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.109 
had a good lecture

1268
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:22.249 
like this one.

1269
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.889 
So they love it, apparently.

1270
00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.899 
But of course, this is one room.

1271
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.089 
There's a video director

1272
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.090 
who's managing

1273
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.009 
camera standpoints from three sides.

1274
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:35.779 
And the audio is fabulous.

1275
00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.759 
But you can't afford many

1276
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.779 
rooms like this in one

1277
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.149 
university. Right.

1278
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:42.679 
So they're building the second and a

1279
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.689 
third for the whole campus.

1280
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.369 
That's a little bit off, of course.

1281
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.229 
So the

1282
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:50.869 
risks I hear and I see

1283
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:51.870 
so far,

1284
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:54.769 
they were mentioned by then as

1285
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.469 
well. It's costly.

1286
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.979 
You need a lot of equipment.

1287
00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.959 
It's time consuming to develop

1288
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.196 
good education for hybrid teaching.

1289
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.639 
You'll have the extra cognitive load

1290
00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.529 
for teachers.

1291
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.779 
So I would like to hear later

1292
00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.669 
in the discussion then, if

1293
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.589 
this doesn't work, what

1294
00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:13.590 
they use

1295
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.519 
in Chile.

1296
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.859 
But I think there's a risk of

1297
00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.989 
having worst of both worlds

1298
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.990 
if you do this.

1299
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.659 
So that led me to

1300
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.089 
this black

1301
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:31.979 
scenario, if you

1302
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.899 
think about what do we want

1303
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.769 
after the lockdown?

1304
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.649 
Right. And I think there's one

1305
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.959 
huge risk and that students

1306
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.819 
getting accustomed to the

1307
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.739 
choice of choosing how and

1308
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.540 
where and when to take classes.

1309
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.449 
And there's a very concrete

1310
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.629 
example of this, which

1311
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.550 
is this if this was

1312
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.389 
a header in the newspaper

1313
00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.639 
of live university

1314
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.069 
newspaper and

1315
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:05.319 
this is very recent.

1316
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.548 
Teachers who know

1317
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:09.009 
it's possible started again with

1318
00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.229 
hybrid teaching, they found

1319
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.509 
almost empty classrooms.

1320
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:14.510 
So,

1321
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.329 
they're afraid that we create

1322
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:20.010 
a Netflix generation

1323
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.129 
and they asked

1324
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.169 
around and some students

1325
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.179 
are just they can't cope

1326
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.999 
anymore with the hope and the

1327
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.529 
media and they don't come

1328
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.809 
to the class.

1329
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:35.759 
But there are others who just choose

1330
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.629 
not to come to because they said,

1331
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.539 
"for one hour, I don't want

1332
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.429 
to commute the

1333
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.289 
whole way to the campus

1334
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.669 
and then go back".

1335
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.799 
So I think,

1336
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.089 
well, you understand this,

1337
00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.909 
the possible scenario that

1338
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:51.929 
we might create.

1339
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.910 
The other risks.

1340
00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.099 
If higher education and I

1341
00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.049 
hear this afternoon,

1342
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:04.879 
Mauro also talking about

1343
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.039 
the comparison between Europe

1344
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.079 
and the United States, if

1345
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.129 
there will be more and more

1346
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.139 
competition, and I've

1347
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.209 
also heard this

1348
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.879 
from Asian countries

1349
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.099 
where education

1350
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.169 
will be expensive and students

1351
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:23.569 
will not be able to

1352
00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.459 
invest or if

1353
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.499 
you offer them the choice, there

1354
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.359 
might be the sorry

1355
00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.939 
for Ryanair, but I mean, the

1356
00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.019 
prizefights are

1357
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.929 
companies who take

1358
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.849 
away strip all services

1359
00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.099 
to offer you a cheap

1360
00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.449 
kind of education.

1361
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.429 
We might end up with it.

1362
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.409 
So only the elites might be able

1363
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:47.869 
to go to campus education, which

1364
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:49.879 
at least in Europe would.

1365
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.579 
Yeah, it's the most

1366
00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.439 
higher education is

1367
00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.779 
public and everybody can

1368
00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.609 
afford a campus education,

1369
00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.559 
but it might become different.

1370
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.449 
And I think especially

1371
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:04.789 
if we

1372
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.799 
fuse lifelong learners

1373
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.719 
and young students and there

1374
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.819 
will be one like commercial

1375
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.649 
markets where we

1376
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:14.779 
serve these shorts

1377
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.000 
credentials for job related

1378
00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.329 
competencies and where you don't

1379
00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:25.339 
get the full

1380
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.929 
education that builds your

1381
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.009 
character.

1382
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.349 
So this is my

1383
00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.389 
black scenario, but let's go to

1384
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.279 
the bright scenario.

1385
00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.439 
And I go to Europe because

1386
00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.849 
it's a MOOCs, right.

1387
00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:39.769 
So in

1388
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:41.599 
my ideal future,

1389
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.699 
there's at least I'm talking

1390
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.327 
about these young students, right.

1391
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.559 
University education

1392
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.109 
will stay as an emerging

1393
00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.629 
character building experience

1394
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.819 
its own campus we

1395
00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.679 
can't do it otherwise.

1396
00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.389 
Human to human interaction, of

1397
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.519 
course, there's a lot possible

1398
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.349 
through technology, but I think it's

1399
00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:04.789 
only to enrich

1400
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.659 
the face to face

1401
00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.669 
interaction

1402
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:13.159 
and the campus will

1403
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.139 
keep on evolving to support

1404
00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.689 
this tool to facilitate

1405
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.309 
this. Also, the spontaneous

1406
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:21.169 
meetings, the serendipity

1407
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:22.170 
of the meetings,

1408
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:25.159 
to have a

1409
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.469 
chat with the teacher and hear

1410
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:29.359 
what the teacher does when he's

1411
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.249 
not teaching. Some students have no

1412
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.569 
clue.

1413
00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.329 
But you can find out when you lunch

1414
00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:36.889 
in the canteen and talk to your

1415
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:37.890 
teacher there.

1416
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.239 
I think approach is like challenge

1417
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.249 
based learning are

1418
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.349 
a very beautiful tool

1419
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:47.299 
to insights, the

1420
00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.159 
drive for students to want to learn.

1421
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.199 
And of course, in that case,

1422
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.999 
technology will enrich the

1423
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.299 
Face-To-Face experience.

1424
00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.999 
And yeah,

1425
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.919 
you know, I've been an

1426
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.259 
evangelist for digital education

1427
00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.239 
for more than twenty five years

1428
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.799 
and I would never believe it.

1429
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.929 
But I'm saying that I believe

1430
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.479 
for young students on campus,

1431
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.239 
it's the norm and

1432
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.339 
it's beautiful if they can stay

1433
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.599 
like that.

1434
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.890 
There's one

1435
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.360 
last

1436
00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.709 
possibility because you don't want

1437
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:26.839 
students to be like

1438
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.789 
closed within their

1439
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.919 
own university.

1440
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.919 
And that's the collaboration over

1441
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.749 
the frontiers of the

1442
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:37.789 
faculty of the university,

1443
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:39.379 
even of a country.

1444
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:40.999 
And I've called it the hybrid

1445
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.109 
curriculum.

1446
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.329 
And that's what we are working also

1447
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.519 
on for Leiden, Delft

1448
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.520 
and Erasmus.

1449
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.989 
And what I see there

1450
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.779 
is the digital transformation

1451
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.669 
that it requires is the student

1452
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:58.009 
journey is

1453
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.570 
when we talk to students,

1454
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.409 
they are interested in taking

1455
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.239 
courses somewhere

1456
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.559 
else. And in the Netherlands, you

1457
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.629 
can take courses or minors

1458
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.609 
or whatever in any university

1459
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.019 
in the Netherlands without any

1460
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.449 
problem, without payment.

1461
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.349 
But they don't.

1462
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:16.429 
Why don't they do it?

1463
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.559 
Because it takes a lot of paperwork.

1464
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.569 
You don't understand what you need

1465
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.489 
to do. You do get stuck

1466
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.809 
somewhere halfway.

1467
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.669 
Nobody tells you

1468
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:26.719 
you give up.

1469
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.549 
So this is what you're doing.

1470
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:30.919 
It's the National Project,

1471
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.689 
Student Mobility.

1472
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.329 
And we are creating

1473
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.519 
a student journey

1474
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.499 
where they can put their

1475
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.519 
feet on

1476
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.429 
the table and be

1477
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.799 
relaxed and know where they are.

1478
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.629 
So that's the word we take

1479
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:49.729 
away. And then once they

1480
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.919 
enroll for, let's say, a minor

1481
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.169 
at another university or a

1482
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:56.029 
minor, then

1483
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:57.949 
we expect them to travel

1484
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.719 
and to interact.

1485
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.729 
And, of course, if you do group

1486
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.079 
work, you don't always need to

1487
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.329 
travel. You can use all the digital

1488
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:06.439 
means we have.

1489
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.479 
But yeah,

1490
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.609 
I think that what we see

1491
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:12.089 
is so important

1492
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:16.339 
this afternoon.

1493
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.889 
Also, Mauro, I think somebody

1494
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:20.749 
told us,

1495
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:22.669 
was talking about some

1496
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.579 
research where teamwork

1497
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.859 
skills is at the top

1498
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.469 
of what employers

1499
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:33.259 
expects from students, and

1500
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.449 
that's what we are building

1501
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.450 
through this

1502
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.189 
crossing borders education,

1503
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.779 
this hybrid's curriculum.

1504
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.609 
It's training and

1505
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:45.139 
having students practice their

1506
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.969 
multidisciplinary teamwork

1507
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:48.679 
skills or intercultural

1508
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.949 
and multidisciplinary teamwork

1509
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:52.950 
skills.

1510
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.389 
Yeah, so that's my

1511
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:58.459 
future scenario.

1512
00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.569 
The bright one.

1513
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.849 
And I encountered

1514
00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:03.709 
when preparing this

1515
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:05.810 
test, I encountered this

1516
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.849 
report and it's lovely.

1517
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.069 
It has all the risks there

1518
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.959 
and all the recommendations for

1519
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.969 
the European policymakers

1520
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:18.949 
to really create this bright

1521
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:19.969 
future.

1522
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:22.219 
So, yeah, that's

1523
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.169 
where I will end my

1524
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:25.579 
presentation.

1525
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:26.580 
Thank you.

1526
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.599 
Thank you very much, Marija, and

1527
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.309 
thanks for finishing with the

1528
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:34.469 
positive view, the

1529
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.389 
positive reflection of what the

1530
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:37.800 
future may hold.

1531
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.939 
Thank you very much to the three

1532
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:42.719 
panelists.

1533
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.609 
I remind the audience that

1534
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:46.049 
you can leave your questions in the

1535
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.159 
chat.

1536
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.289 
We're going to start the debate.

1537
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.809 
And I would like to start

1538
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.029 
with something that

1539
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.859 
you mentioned, Marija, and

1540
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.809 
this is about the age

1541
00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.969 
of the students when

1542
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.139 
they have

1543
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.349 
to do face hybrid

1544
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.239 
education, which is not the

1545
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.179 
same to have a student

1546
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.039 
that is 18 years

1547
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.229 
old, to have just arrived

1548
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.269 
at the university after finishing

1549
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.270 
school,

1550
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:19.109 
that another student that

1551
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.359 
is in 20 something

1552
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.279 
is doing a post

1553
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.869 
graduate degree.

1554
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.959 
So the degree of

1555
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.209 
maturity, a level of maturity of

1556
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:31.379 
these two students.

1557
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.329 
This is completely different.

1558
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.609 
And what would

1559
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.599 
I personally have seen this year

1560
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.414 
is in

1561
00:54:39.415 --> 00:54:41.339 
a kind of hybrid

1562
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.199 
mode that we have been teaching

1563
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.689 
instead for first year students.

1564
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:47.669 
It does not work

1565
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.159 
very well because they don't know

1566
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.349 
anybody on

1567
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.209 
the university in the

1568
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:55.679 
first year that this is the

1569
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.649 
experience, the campus experience.

1570
00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.959 
They are completely lost.

1571
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.449 
So that is a part that is

1572
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.879 
missing. And so comparing

1573
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.369 
the different ages that

1574
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:10.439 
the students may have when they

1575
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.419 
are at the best,

1576
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:14.399 
what is your vision of

1577
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.700 
hybrid education for them?

1578
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.219 
And I can start maybe

1579
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.149 
with Dan.

1580
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:23.069 
So your vision

1581
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:24.989 
from engagement of

1582
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:27.329 
the different ages that the students

1583
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:29.249 
can have, for example, when you

1584
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:30.250 
seen engagement,

1585
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.789 
did you have, for example,

1586
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:35.099 
experiences with younger students

1587
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.859 
that did not end up well or

1588
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.050 
they did it without problems?

1589
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:44.349 
Thank you for the question.

1590
00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:46.389 
And so

1591
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:48.639 
I actually have a personal

1592
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.799 
point of view on that, because

1593
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.329 
we have our daughter, who was a high

1594
00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:53.769 
school student last year, is now a

1595
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:55.569 
first year student at Berkeley.

1596
00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:57.459 
So she showed up

1597
00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:00.009 
to Berkeley in the middle of a

1598
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:00.969 
pandemic.

1599
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:03.069 
And interestingly, and this

1600
00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:05.079 
actually is along with Marija

1601
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.089 
was saying she actually

1602
00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:09.039 
ended up renting an apartment there

1603
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.959 
and moved there in September of last

1604
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.949 
year, even though Berkeley was

1605
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:13.419 
completely online for the entire

1606
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.309 
year. And so

1607
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.439 
she definitely had a fair amount

1608
00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.359 
of the social

1609
00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.829 
type of aspects.

1610
00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:22.989 
That particular generation

1611
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.669 
does not exactly believe in the

1612
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.889 
coronavirus, hence

1613
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:27.909 
at least over here.

1614
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.799 
And even Berkeley had a

1615
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.599 
few large outbreaks,

1616
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.379 
but all the education was

1617
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.179 
online and it was a successful year

1618
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.919 
for her. I mean, she did really well

1619
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.359 
academically.

1620
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.189 
You have to remember that these kids

1621
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.149 
are digital natives.

1622
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.189 
I mean, they grew up holding

1623
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:46.569 
a cell phone in one hand, a tablet,

1624
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:48.489 
another hand and all that while

1625
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:50.169 
using a computer.

1626
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:51.759 
The other thing is ask their what

1627
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.069 
was the size of their classes and

1628
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:54.879 
Berkley is a large public

1629
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.869 
university.

1630
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:57.489 
The smallest class in Berkeley is

1631
00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.449 
100 students.

1632
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:01.119 
The largest class is 800 students,

1633
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.529 
Susanna showed one of these big

1634
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:04.719 
auditoriums that is small compared

1635
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.669 
to the size of the rooms in a large

1636
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.589 
U.S. university.

1637
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.419 
Even Daphne's class at

1638
00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.829 
Stanford, which when she was

1639
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.869 
teaching it a few years ago, was

1640
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.819 
300 students in machine learning

1641
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.249 
class is mushroomed to a thousand

1642
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:19.929 
students at Stanford, which is not a

1643
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:21.339 
large university.

1644
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.199 
So our vision is that for

1645
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.999 
these very large classrooms, which

1646
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.499 
are actually pretty typical for

1647
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.940 
undergraduate education

1648
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.269 
in the type of

1649
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:33.369 
environment we provide, should

1650
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:35.259 
lead to better learning outcomes

1651
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.059 
for the students because they don't

1652
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.259 
feel they're sitting in this huge

1653
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.369 
mass of students.

1654
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.199 
The way we chalk it up, as you know,

1655
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.429 
Carlos, are sitting in these small

1656
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:43.779 
tables are collaborating.

1657
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.579 
They're working on a team while at

1658
00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.409 
the same time it's still like

1659
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.059 
Marija was saying they do feel they

1660
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.409 
have a connection with their fellow

1661
00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:52.029 
students. Again, they're not in this

1662
00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.619 
huge pool that, you know, in

1663
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:54.609 
competitive platforms.

1664
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.419 
You don't see the videos.

1665
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.779 
They see the videos of the friends.

1666
00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:58.059 
They can talk to their friends.

1667
00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.609 
They can also see the instructor.

1668
00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:01.629 
They can interact with the

1669
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.519 
instructor. So I think we are

1670
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.099 
trying to achieve

1671
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.049 
the happy scenario, not

1672
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:09.445 
the sad.

1673
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.459 
That's it. I 100 percent agree that

1674
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.919 
there is room for in-person

1675
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.759 
education.

1676
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.469 
As people go through to the later

1677
00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:19.419 
years, the classes tend to

1678
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.019 
become smaller.

1679
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.929 
Again, I studied engineering.

1680
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:24.819 
I don't know how you do a lab

1681
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.559 
fully remotely or how you do a

1682
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.639 
medical degree.

1683
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.629 
I mean, you still need people

1684
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:30.579 
holding soldiering irons, although

1685
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.199 
this generation has no idea what

1686
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.229 
soldering iron is. But

1687
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.529 
you definitely want people to do

1688
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:37.269 
physics experiments, chemistry

1689
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.339 
experiments, and you need that fully

1690
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.079 
in person as well as for small

1691
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.119 
seminars. It is very nice to do it

1692
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.920 
in person setting.

1693
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.039 
OK, thank you very much, Dan.

1694
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.899 
Well, actually, I would say

1695
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.479 
that remote laboratories

1696
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.739 
have improved.

1697
00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.809 
This is not exactly

1698
00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:58.459 
the same. No, they're the same

1699
00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.049 
feeling that you could have when you

1700
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:01.559 
touch something.

1701
00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.679 
And unfortunately, at least last

1702
00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.389 
year with the lockdown this

1703
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:06.799 
experience, something that the

1704
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.689 
students could not have.

1705
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:11.609 
But, well, the technology has

1706
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:14.629 
shown some progress to try to

1707
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:15.630 
alleviate this

1708
00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:17.940 
scenario.

1709
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.869 
Maybe I can move

1710
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:23.059 
to Susanna and then

1711
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.409 
and then, Marija, about your

1712
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.599 
reflections on

1713
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.159 
hybrid learning for different ages

1714
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.199 
and also maybe for different

1715
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.329 
areas of knowledge, because

1716
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:34.189 
it's not the same teaching a

1717
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:36.349 
hybrid course on engineering,

1718
00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:39.349 
on health sciences

1719
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:41.509 
or on the humanities

1720
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:43.579 
or social sciences, for example.

1721
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.080 
So Susanna, for example.

1722
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:48.319 
Yeah. So this is very interesting,

1723
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.329 
the topic of different

1724
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:51.919 
disciplines.

1725
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.929 
And in my opinion,

1726
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:55.879 
the real difference,

1727
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.369 
it's about the

1728
00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.519 
real necessity of the Hands-On

1729
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.589 
or not in

1730
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:06.199 
the sense that if you have

1731
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.059 
to touch things

1732
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.090 
to do and

1733
01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.939 
to put hands on things

1734
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.549 
as a laboratory, of some,

1735
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.629 
we have experimented a lot

1736
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.779 
with the VR systems

1737
01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.059 
and similar situations

1738
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.009 
that can provide a

1739
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.162 
first hand training about

1740
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.689 
can't replace

1741
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:33.529 
totally events on experience.

1742
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:35.639 
So in a discipline in which

1743
01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.499 
you need an experience

1744
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.649 
that you have to provide to

1745
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.549 
it in quite

1746
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:43.519 
the traditional ways, in the sense

1747
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.409 
that you can provide previous

1748
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:48.529 
training through digital

1749
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.449 
channels and after

1750
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:51.745 
you need to provide physical

1751
01:00:51.746 --> 01:00:52.746 
experiences.

1752
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.510 
But actually,

1753
01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.659 
in our university, if you have

1754
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.419 
a limited number of situations

1755
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.279 
in unfortunately perhaps

1756
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.499 
in which students have put hands

1757
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.689 
on, so if

1758
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:10.849 
we focus on this also

1759
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:14.779 
in as in medicine

1760
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.849 
courses, for example, I

1761
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:18.799 
am working a lot

1762
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.899 
in our course that

1763
01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.489 
is called a MEDTECH.

1764
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.859 
That's a mix

1765
01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.719 
between medicine

1766
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.969 
and in engineering and

1767
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:30.589 
bioengineering.

1768
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:32.569 
And there

1769
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.549 
we see that a lot of very

1770
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:36.619 
important matters

1771
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.620 
can

1772
01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:39.709 
usefully

1773
01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320 
be developed

1774
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.459 
through a mix of

1775
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.649 
online or face to face

1776
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:49.650 
activities,

1777
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:52.470 
hands-on

1778
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.639 
opportunities.

1779
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.619 
So my answer

1780
01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.099 
is there is not a problem of

1781
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.799 
discipline, is a problem of what

1782
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.329 
kind of activities.

1783
01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:04.279 
And in every situation

1784
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.499 
you have a very critical aspects

1785
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.389 
in which you can be helped

1786
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:10.459 
in your memory and your

1787
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.839 
understanding.

1788
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.849 
Also, will digital tools

1789
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:15.679 
in order things for your

1790
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.659 
better understanding and a better

1791
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.559 
experience.

1792
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560 
You can

1793
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:22.849 
be and you can

1794
01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:25.879 
need an interaction

1795
01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.469 
with the people.

1796
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:29.299 
And this interaction

1797
01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.219 
can be provided in a very

1798
01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.529 
effective way, both online

1799
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:35.029 
and face to face.

1800
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.289 
In other situations you need hands

1801
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.479 
-on, some very interesting

1802
01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.310 
things that is up to provide

1803
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.279 
a robust metrological tools

1804
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.169 
that allow

1805
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:47.089 
teachers of every

1806
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:49.549 
discipline in designing,

1807
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:51.529 
teaching-learning experiences,

1808
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:53.359 
using all

1809
01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.489 
the notes that we have

1810
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:56.779 
of our disposition.

1811
01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.789 
Not a day two or three note that

1812
01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:00.229 
we know very well.

1813
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:02.059 
I know that this

1814
01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.889 
is difficult.

1815
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:05.779 
But, you know, I would I would

1816
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.909 
like to tell you thing

1817
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:10.069 
that now we are seeing that

1818
01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.769 
teachers are asking

1819
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:14.899 
hybrid learning for their

1820
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.759 
training because they

1821
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.319 
say hybrid learning is very

1822
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.279 
difficult.

1823
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.649 
It's a battle when you are providing

1824
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.599 
training for them, they say,

1825
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.699 
well, I can't stay at home.

1826
01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.909 
I need to stay at home or

1827
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:29.929 
in my

1828
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:30.889 
department.

1829
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.839 
And all the other teachers

1830
01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.009 
can come there.

1831
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.419 
Why not?

1832
01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.459 
So I am sure

1833
01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.559 
that this hybrid model is

1834
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.019 
difficult but not impossible.

1835
01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.119 
And the best universities will

1836
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.309 
be able to support

1837
01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:48.429 
them and to mix with

1838
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:51.050 
our teaching-learning experiences.

1839
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.059 
OK, thank you, Susanna, and thanks

1840
01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.439 
for your reflection of the

1841
01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.659 
possibilities of technology,

1842
01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.889 
but there are some things that need

1843
01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:01.959 
to be done, hands-on,

1844
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.879 
and they should be done

1845
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.919 
definitely on campus

1846
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.949 
if they cannot be done

1847
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:09.149 
otherwise.

1848
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:11.019 
I assume

1849
01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.099 
that this year you try

1850
01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.100 
to keep all the

1851
01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:24.232 
hands-on activities as much as possible with you moving online. Some of

1852
01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:26.019 
the things that did this time.

1853
01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.629 
I was there that actually

1854
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:31.059 
we couldn't move everything

1855
01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.229 
along.

1856
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:34.089 
A lot of things could be

1857
01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:36.219 
moved online in an effective way,

1858
01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.070 
but anything else.

1859
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.929 
OK, thank you very much.

1860
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:43.749 
Let's move to Marija.

1861
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.999 
In your opinion.

1862
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.529 
I don't know if the black or the

1863
01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.959 
bright side of

1864
01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.819 
what's going to happen with the

1865
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.949 
hybrid in depending on ages

1866
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:54.950 
and depending on discipline.

1867
01:04:58.030 --> 01:04:59.949 
Yeah, on the one

1868
01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:02.079 
hand, I was surprised

1869
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.999 
to see that even

1870
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.249 
for instance, I remember discussions

1871
01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.009 
with the faculty of archaeology

1872
01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:11.769 
where they said field work

1873
01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:13.599 
needs to be done in

1874
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.282 
person. It can't be done,

1875
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.839 
learning about materials, you

1876
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.949 
need to touch

1877
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.486 
the stone and to know. And then they found out that a lot of it could be

1878
01:05:56.487 --> 01:05:56.500 
prepared online and then reduce the time that you need to be in the

1879
01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:56.512 
field. So, yeah. It helped the situation, helped to redevelop also this

1880
01:05:56.513 --> 01:05:56.525 
kind of practical subjects. And another thing that comes to mind now is

1881
01:05:56.526 --> 01:05:57.399 
for fields like medical education and others where images

1882
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.439 
are important there, there

1883
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.599 
is already a lot of digital

1884
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.829 
content there.

1885
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.059 
And we had an interesting

1886
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.149 
discussion, by the way, also before

1887
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.419 
COVID came, one

1888
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.804 
of the medical schools

1889
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:17.889 
wanted to use the

1890
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:19.959 
older digital

1891
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.399 
educational materials from the

1892
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.349 
publisher, one of

1893
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:25.779 
the big publishers that have

1894
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.039 
this learning book and all this

1895
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.049 
material that comes

1896
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:31.779 
with it, which means

1897
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.029 
if you use that, you have

1898
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:35.649 
a huge amount of materials, you

1899
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:36.999 
don't have to make yourself.

1900
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000 
But.

1901
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.019 
I understand you

1902
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.389 
develop a curriculum maybe

1903
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:45.429 
or redevelop it maybe once every

1904
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:47.409 
six years, so if you choose to do

1905
01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:49.359 
so and use this

1906
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.909 
book and these materials, you are

1907
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:54.399 
like stuck with this

1908
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.050 
publisher for six years

1909
01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:59.049 
at least. And then maybe teachers

1910
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:00.549 
don't want to move away from the

1911
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.049 
materials because they would have to

1912
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:03.699 
redevelop everything.

1913
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.619 
So it brings up

1914
01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.620 
the question

1915
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.729 
of, the production of materials is costly.

1916
01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:12.429 
There are solutions of publishers,

1917
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.349 
but it's more than a book that

1918
01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:16.270 
a book you don't

1919
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.849 
stick so much to one class

1920
01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:21.430 
or stick to one publisher.

1921
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.419 
And within one medical

1922
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.969 
school, there were people who were

1923
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.709 
very much in favor of open

1924
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.749 
education, produced it themselves

1925
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.139 
and people who wanted to use these

1926
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.409 
publishers materials.

1927
01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:37.599 
So that's another thing that

1928
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600 
comes to mind.

1929
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.889 
Thank you very much for sharing your

1930
01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.359 
reflections.

1931
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.639 
I was thinking about

1932
01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.779 
something else, a word

1933
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.799 
that has appeared

1934
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.579 
in this family.

1935
01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.539 
This is about the cost in

1936
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.339 
this case. And I'm going to I would

1937
01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.959 
like to talk about the cost of

1938
01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.579 
hybrid education from the

1939
01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.229 
perspective of the student and from

1940
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.110 
the perspective of the university.

1941
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.119 
On one side,

1942
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.120 
we

1943
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:09.809 
have European universities that are

1944
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:11.759 
typically public universities where

1945
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.039 
the fees for students

1946
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.899 
are very low and in

1947
01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.879 
some cases in existence, or

1948
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.549 
at least they are low fees

1949
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.889 
compared to private universities.

1950
01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.539 
And then we have the case in the US

1951
01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.398 
where the fees are much

1952
01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:27.869 
higher.

1953
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.068 
So from the perspective of the

1954
01:08:29.069 --> 01:08:31.919 
student, the student may say that

1955
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.898 
going into the same university

1956
01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:36.059 
but taking but going

1957
01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.009 
physically to the university might

1958
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.139 
be, for example, might be

1959
01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.559 
worth a higher fee than

1960
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.929 
following the classes online

1961
01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:46.879 
or not.

1962
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.970 
This is a reflection.

1963
01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:50.099 
On the other side, we have the

1964
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.079 
university that

1965
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.059 
needed to do a big

1966
01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.999 
investment in infrastructure,

1967
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.949 
in equipment due

1968
01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:01.139 
to the COVID, to provide

1969
01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.459 
appropriate equipment for the

1970
01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.709 
teachers, to

1971
01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.749 
improve the

1972
01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.639 
classrooms so that we

1973
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.769 
can have classrooms

1974
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.599 
such as the one that you

1975
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.549 
showed to us, Marija,

1976
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.409 
with these big screens and

1977
01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:18.329 
these nice,

1978
01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:19.330 
very nice chairs.

1979
01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:22.679 
So how do we deal with

1980
01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.778 
this situation about the cost?

1981
01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:26.879 
From the perspective of the student

1982
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.978 
and from their perspective, both

1983
01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:30.959 
of the university,

1984
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.909 
maybe this time I can start

1985
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:34.858 
with Susanna, for example,

1986
01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:36.869 
and then we will move

1987
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:37.870 
around.

1988
01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:43.219 
Yes, about the costs.

1989
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.589 
I think that the market

1990
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:47.898 
is changing very, very fast,

1991
01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:49.909 
the Ed Tech market

1992
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:51.589 
is changing very fast.

1993
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.869 
So now we have quite

1994
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:55.270 
high costs for

1995
01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:59.419 
keeping in a good way, classrooms

1996
01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.420 
for

1997
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.559 
the hybrid learning.

1998
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.689 
But we have to say that

1999
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.759 
half of the worker

2000
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.709 
has been already done during

2001
01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.599 
the pandemic in

2002
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.579 
the unfancy

2003
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.139 
situation.

2004
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.779 
And so

2005
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.639 
I think that the

2006
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.579 
problem is not exactly

2007
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.829 
the cost of the infrastructure,

2008
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:25.830 
but the

2009
01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.929 
topic of human resources

2010
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:32.299 
because of designing

2011
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.539 
and managing and

2012
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.359 
improving along

2013
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.399 
the years, these kind

2014
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.499 
of equipments and this new

2015
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.229 
model for all the universities

2016
01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:47.170 
you need very skilled

2017
01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.899 
people in the management design

2018
01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.389 
and public universities

2019
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:55.209 
in Europe often

2020
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.319 
can't provide

2021
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000 
high

2022
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.459 
money for this kind

2023
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.269 
of resources.

2024
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.380 
So they can't afford

2025
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.209 
it.

2026
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:10.639 
And this is a

2027
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.649 
big problem, in my opinion,

2028
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.139 
because this evolution is requiring

2029
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.329 
a very rapid evolution

2030
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:19.159 
over the qualifications of a

2031
01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.949 
human resources in the universities.

2032
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:24.439 
Thank you very much, Susanna.

2033
01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.429 
Yes, that's also true.

2034
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.349 
We need, as you say, skilled

2035
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.689 
people with different profiles

2036
01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:31.690 
to support

2037
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:33.960 
teachers, to support

2038
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.759 
students, to do the management,

2039
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.289 
to do the instructional design or

2040
01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:41.819 
helping the instructional design for

2041
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.579 
teachers and so on.

2042
01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.659 
And this is also definitely very,

2043
01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.660 
very important.

2044
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:50.369 
So, Marija, in your case,

2045
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:52.709 
what is your view about this

2046
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:53.710 
topic of the cost?

2047
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:57.319 
I think that well, as I said,

2048
01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.179 
that it's a big risk

2049
01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.180 
of

2050
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:03.789 
reducing costs for students

2051
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:05.439 
if they don't have the campus

2052
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.719 
education, I think that the students

2053
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.579 
who need it most

2054
01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.769 
won't be able to

2055
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:12.579 
come to campus.

2056
01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.589 
So that's something

2057
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:16.479 
I really would like to

2058
01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.480 
avoid.

2059
01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.069 
Now, on the side of the

2060
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.989 
institutions, I think

2061
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:24.939 
collaboration is the answer.

2062
01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.039 
And I've been working

2063
01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.040 
on

2064
01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:33.579 
this open educational resources

2065
01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.499 
and I know how hard it is

2066
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.000 
and that any teacher

2067
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.719 
feels like you need to make your

2068
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.729 
own resources and develop your

2069
01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:44.439 
own course.

2070
01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.539 
Even they feel guilty when they use

2071
01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.430 
materials from other teachers.

2072
01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.579 
But it's the only answer

2073
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:55.299 
we can't keep up.

2074
01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.369 
Collaboration and I think

2075
01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:59.239 
Europe is great for collaboration,

2076
01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.329 
so I hope things

2077
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:02.500 
will change in that way.

2078
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.649 
OK, thank you very much.

2079
01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:07.559 
Definitely, I wish we had good

2080
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.719 
collaborating in many, many projects

2081
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.429 
and initiatives and beautiful

2082
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.619 
exchanges you mentioned before

2083
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.839 
the Erasmus program and

2084
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840 
so on.

2085
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:19.559 
Exactly. And so I would like to move

2086
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.399 
to Dan.

2087
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.930 
And in this case,

2088
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.679 
one of the costs

2089
01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.749 
that the universities need

2090
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.699 
to take care of is the

2091
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.589 
cost of platforms of

2092
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:33.629 
software that is becoming more

2093
01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:35.399 
and more and more important as the

2094
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.949 
universities move to online.

2095
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.989 
Maybe they were using some tools,

2096
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:41.759 
platforms that they needed to scale

2097
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.619 
up these platforms

2098
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.809 
that are a number of

2099
01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:48.029 
supporting tools at the universities

2100
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:50.189 
or that teachers are using right

2101
01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:51.389 
now.

2102
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:53.399 
So how do you see the

2103
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.749 
topic of the cost

2104
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.169 
as a platform provider

2105
01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:00.719 
in this case for universities?

2106
01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.509 
Well, it's definitely

2107
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:07.429 
cheaper than the cost

2108
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.379 
you have to incur for every student

2109
01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.719 
on a physical plant.

2110
01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.829 
I mean, I don't think there's any

2111
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:13.679 
doubt about that.

2112
01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.719 
We keep working very

2113
01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.569 
hard. And, you know, that's

2114
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:18.859 
from the conversation we've had to

2115
01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.839 
drive down the cost of the

2116
01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.699 
technology as low as we possibly

2117
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.859 
can.

2118
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.579 
I think easily and also because we

2119
01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.529 
integrate many different

2120
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.029 
types of products or the polling and

2121
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:31.039 
quizzing is built into the platform.

2122
01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.269 
The recording is built into the

2123
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:34.129 
platform. The video clip playback

2124
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:36.169 
is all built into the platform.

2125
01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:38.119 
And if you look actually of

2126
01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.589 
all the some of the different things

2127
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:41.899 
we replace, it's actually

2128
01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.819 
we enable the university to save

2129
01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.829 
money because, again,

2130
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:47.599 
it's all incorporated to one.

2131
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.979 
But if you kind of look at the

2132
01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.980 
higher level,

2133
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:52.729 
we need to be able to educate more

2134
01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:53.659 
and more and more people on the

2135
01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:54.619 
planet. I mean, there's more and

2136
01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.269 
more people on the planet, A and B,

2137
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:58.009 
the number of jobs that people can

2138
01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:59.849 
have that do not require education

2139
01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:00.709 
shrinking.

2140
01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:02.629 
So unless we want to have

2141
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.699 
a profound source of

2142
01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.039 
social issues,

2143
01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.719 
we need to figure out how to scale

2144
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.269 
up education rapidly and

2145
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:12.979 
definitely the type of education

2146
01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.839 
that we enable

2147
01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.409 
people to provide them engaging in

2148
01:15:16.410 --> 01:15:18.079 
because of the interaction, because

2149
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.179 
of all that is much higher

2150
01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.799 
than you can in a typical MOOC.

2151
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.149 
But I can tell you that in the early

2152
01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.339 
days of Coursera definitely

2153
01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.499 
would get these emails from people

2154
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.239 
whose lives were profoundly changed

2155
01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.619 
by the fact that they could someday

2156
01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.439 
take a very high quality course

2157
01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.659 
from an elite university

2158
01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.429 
for basically nothing or a very

2159
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:39.019 
small amount. And I don't know if

2160
01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.279 
any of you visited the Coursera

2161
01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.409 
headquarters, but the walls are full

2162
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:44.479 
of basically learner stories.

2163
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.429 
And so, yes, maybe it's not face

2164
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:47.809 
to face and they don't get to

2165
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.999 
basically enjoy

2166
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.769 
the ambiance that you get at an

2167
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:53.179 
elite American or European

2168
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.259 
university.

2169
01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.239 
But for people that have not

2170
01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.279 
this option, the option of

2171
01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.709 
getting a really good

2172
01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:02.569 
skill that they can then deploy and

2173
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:04.669 
enhance their income I

2174
01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.539 
think is vital.

2175
01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.489 
So I'm

2176
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:08.989 
a huge believer that technology

2177
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:10.849 
should be used to basically

2178
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:13.579 
make education far more accessible.

2179
01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.379 
And what we do engages with without

2180
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:16.339 
to be good education.

2181
01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.869 
And like Marija was saying, and I

2182
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:18.739 
fully agree with the words that

2183
01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.269 
people that need it most are the

2184
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:22.189 
people that are the least

2185
01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:24.049 
may be disciplined or they need

2186
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.889 
more help.

2187
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:26.599 
This is why we created the tables,

2188
01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:27.979 
why we create all these engagement

2189
01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.989 
measures. Exactly to help using

2190
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:32.089 
technology to serve these people.

2191
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:34.095 
And by the way, Carlos,

2192
01:16:34.096 --> 01:16:35.269 
somebody asked the question, would

2193
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:36.289 
you like me to chat with you?

2194
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:37.290 
Like me to answer that?

2195
01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.129 
So it actually is explained in the

2196
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:41.859 
paper, but I'll give a little bit of

2197
01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.489 
a flavor on what it is.

2198
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:46.729 
So, again, Professor

2199
01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:49.399 
Gibbons', it's a circuit course,

2200
01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.359 
EE (Electrical Engineering) course. And

2201
01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.579 
in these courses, if you lose

2202
01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.799 
anything in the beginning

2203
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.939 
of the lesson, you're not going to

2204
01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.889 
understand what

2205
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:59.149 
they talk about as the lesson

2206
01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:00.169 
progresses.

2207
01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:02.869 
The way they set it up is

2208
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:05.299 
in the case of this

2209
01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.259 
tutor, the video is

2210
01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.679 
that literally, they stop it.

2211
01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.549 
It's not unlike,

2212
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:12.499 
Coursera class. But this was done

2213
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.359 
live. They stopped the class every

2214
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.459 
few minutes and then they have

2215
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.749 
a discussion, which, by the way, you

2216
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:19.369 
cannot do Coursera on a MOOC.

2217
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:21.289 
But this we do facilitate that

2218
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:23.389 
engagement was facilitated

2219
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:25.219 
over there. So the idea was they

2220
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.079 
would stop the video every

2221
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.519 
few minutes and then we just have a

2222
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.989 
conversation. And if somebody did

2223
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:31.909 
not understand what was happening,

2224
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:33.799 
they could ask somebody or they

2225
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.689 
could ask and somebody in the

2226
01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:37.189 
group would invariably know what was

2227
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:39.109 
going on. There was also a Stanford

2228
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:40.849 
student there to help.

2229
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:42.709 
So you don't have the problem that

2230
01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:44.659 
happens in live classes that people

2231
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.519 
are shy to raise a question and

2232
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.359 
ask that.

2233
01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.279 
And the very quickly

2234
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.869 
kind of these people might lose

2235
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:52.339 
thread of what was going on.

2236
01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:54.259 
The way they did it was everybody

2237
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.539 
could progress in a collaborative

2238
01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.489 
way. And that led to these

2239
01:17:58.490 --> 01:18:00.469 
higher learning outcomes in

2240
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:02.119 
a group of people that are going to

2241
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.259 
read the paper.

2242
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:05.539 
As Professor Gibbons points out,

2243
01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.429 
these were not admitted Stanford

2244
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:08.479 
students. Many of them probably

2245
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.679 
would have not been accepted into

2246
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.599 
Stanford, yet they did better than

2247
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.939 
Stanford students because

2248
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.729 
of those accommodations

2249
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:18.859 
for questions, for collaboration

2250
01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:19.860 
and so on.

2251
01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.069 
Thank you very much for answering

2252
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:25.659 
this question in the chat and also

2253
01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.489 
for pointing out what I believe

2254
01:18:27.490 --> 01:18:28.779 
are two important things is the

2255
01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.489 
power of education to change

2256
01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:32.439 
people's lives, in this

2257
01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.149 
case at the low cost or at the

2258
01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:36.159 
reasonable cost.

2259
01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.259 
And also the fact that teachers

2260
01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.209 
today need to know how

2261
01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.829 
to use several tools.

2262
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:43.749 
And in your case, you've managed to

2263
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.759 
integrate several

2264
01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.739 
of the most important tools in

2265
01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.599 
one single environment,

2266
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.399 
in one single platform.

2267
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.400 
OK,

2268
01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:55.719 
I have another question.

2269
01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.969 
We are approaching the end

2270
01:18:57.970 --> 01:18:59.499 
of this panel.

2271
01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.599 
But I would like to talk about

2272
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.119 
the efforts to

2273
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.999 
train the teachers in the new

2274
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.979 
competencies that they need in

2275
01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.869 
order to get used to these new

2276
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:11.829 
environments.

2277
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:14.199 
And there are some

2278
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.149 
competencies that are related to the

2279
01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:18.669 
use of technology,

2280
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.019 
but there are some others that are

2281
01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.059 
more related to how to adapt

2282
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.009 
the methodologies that I

2283
01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:25.010 
used

2284
01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.209 
in my classroom to this

2285
01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:29.439 
new situation.

2286
01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.769 
So I don't know any of

2287
01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:34.479 
you in this case. What has been your

2288
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.699 
experiences with

2289
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.219 
this important part of this training

2290
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.220 
the teachers?

2291
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.389 
Can I start?

2292
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:43.799 
Please go ahead.

2293
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.929 
What I found out is that

2294
01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:47.759 
it works wonderful to hear

2295
01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.979 
the stories from other teachers,

2296
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.109 
right. That's then, you know,

2297
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:54.089 
it's not an expert, but

2298
01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:55.329 
it's somebody like you.

2299
01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.389 
And I also

2300
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:59.159 
was very surprised with the

2301
01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.139 
solutions that our teachers came up

2302
01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.269 
with and the effort

2303
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:04.589 
they put into teaching their

2304
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:06.299 
colleagues and inviting them to

2305
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.429 
their house and then helping

2306
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.439 
them. So I think that worked,

2307
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.909 
especially in the beginning when

2308
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:14.639 
there was this crazy situation.

2309
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640 
It helped a lot

2310
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.469 
more than what I see is it helps

2311
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:21.359 
a lot if the information for

2312
01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.399 
teachers is clear.

2313
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.449 
So there's

2314
01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:26.639 
a website where it's clear

2315
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.469 
which tools to use and

2316
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:29.470 
how.

2317
01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:32.429 
And I saw

2318
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:34.489 
a difference in universities

2319
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:36.839 
that they before

2320
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.789 
Corona, each faculty,

2321
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:40.836 
maybe sometimes each

2322
01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.719 
institutes has its own tool and

2323
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.549 
websites and they will

2324
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:46.559 
centralize it.

2325
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.910 
And that works

2326
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.579 
because then you can have the Help

2327
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.649 
Desk and a clear website

2328
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:53.639 
and so on.

2329
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.099 
And the last thing

2330
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.959 
in my experience, what I saw it

2331
01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.029 
MOOCs, for instance, what works best

2332
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:01.829 
is if you really are going to

2333
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:03.989 
redesign stuff, is

2334
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:06.389 
work on the project instead

2335
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:09.029 
of having

2336
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.099 
people in class, teachers

2337
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.989 
in class and having

2338
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.669 
to adapt it later when they're

2339
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:15.749 
alone.

2340
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.789 
But that's yeah,

2341
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:19.859 
that's a costly way.

2342
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.959 
But it leads to very beautiful

2343
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.040 
results.

2344
01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:27.639 
Thank you very much, Marija for

2345
01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.169 
sharing your experience.

2346
01:21:29.170 --> 01:21:30.170 
Definitely

2347
01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.119 
learning from other colleagues

2348
01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.039 
has been something that has

2349
01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.349 
happened all around

2350
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:39.939 
the world in this pandemic.

2351
01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.319 
We have learned a lot from the good

2352
01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.509 
practices from others, especially

2353
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:45.099 
those who did not have this

2354
01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.169 
experience teaching online

2355
01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:49.209 
and also having this help

2356
01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:51.579 
desk at the universities

2357
01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.409 
in order to have contact point

2358
01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:54.729 
when I have a question.

2359
01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:56.229 
I think it has been also very, very

2360
01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:57.230 
useful.

2361
01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:58.999 
So, for example.

2362
01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.899 
Yes, I'm sorry.

2363
01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:04.059 
I can just add I think about

2364
01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.979 
it, about the

2365
01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.539 
teacher training.

2366
01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.459 
And it could

2367
01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.439 
be a very, very

2368
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.689 
useful to focus

2369
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.729 
on objectivism

2370
01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.769 
more than on technologies

2371
01:22:17.770 --> 01:22:19.210 
in the sense that it

2372
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:22.309 
shows our training in focusing

2373
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:24.129 
about the fact

2374
01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:26.319 
that the students must be able

2375
01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.369 
to do things.

2376
01:22:27.370 --> 01:22:28.509 
At the end of the course,

2377
01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:31.959 
we will

2378
01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.659 
see if they are our responsibility

2379
01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:36.489 
in another perspective

2380
01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:38.109 
that the responsibility is not about

2381
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:40.389 
contents, but it's about

2382
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:42.009 
designing a teaching-learning

2383
01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:44.139 
experience that

2384
01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.329 
supports students

2385
01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:47.769 
in the teaching and learning

2386
01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:49.119 
outcomes.

2387
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.829 
In this perspective,

2388
01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.029 
technological tools are

2389
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:58.359 
a help, not

2390
01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.489 
a constraint that

2391
01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:02.409 
you have to use.

2392
01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.509 
They are a possibility that

2393
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:06.769 
you have for reaching

2394
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:09.009 
in a better way intended

2395
01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:11.109 
learning outcomes with your

2396
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:12.249 
students.

2397
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:13.779 
So it's a totally different

2398
01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.609 
perspective, in my

2399
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:16.610 
opinion.

2400
01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.459 
Well, definitely, I mean, the

2401
01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.829 
technology is there to support,

2402
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.749 
the thing is that some teachers

2403
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:25.639 
have faced new technologies that

2404
01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.819 
were completely new for them, maybe

2405
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.719 
in this scenario, and this could

2406
01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.470 
have hindered the

2407
01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560 
actual

2408
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.969 
methodologies that they were going

2409
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:39.889 
to use so they could be

2410
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:41.929 
a scale technology

2411
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:42.930 
in some cases.

2412
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:46.279 
I don't know if Dan, do you

2413
01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.559 
want to add something, something

2414
01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.989 
else about teacher training?

2415
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.749 
No?

2416
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:56.750 
Yes,

2417
01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:00.009 
so we fully agree that

2418
01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:01.010 
the

2419
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.619 
teaching of the teacher is vitally

2420
01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.089 
important.

2421
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:09.399 
So we set up a group inside

2422
01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.379 
engaging that we call

2423
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.419 
Learning and Teaching, which is

2424
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.519 
headed by a woman who

2425
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.818 
used to run teaching and learning at

2426
01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.539 
Coursera and many of what was said

2427
01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:22.779 
by you, by Marija, by Susanna.

2428
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.759 
We agree. So peer to peer is very

2429
01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:25.615 
important. You know, experiences

2430
01:24:25.616 --> 01:24:27.969 
from one teacher to another

2431
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:29.589 
is extremely important.

2432
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:32.649 
User conferences is important.

2433
01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:34.059 
But I would also like to highlight

2434
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.069 
the importance of

2435
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.510 
instructional designers

2436
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:40.839 
that sound like MOOCs are

2437
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.669 
meant to make a good hybrid

2438
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:44.679 
or online course.

2439
01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.969 
You do need to put a little bit of

2440
01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:47.829 
effort and there's no real reason

2441
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:49.539 
to replicate that effort.

2442
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.909 
If you're teaching the same

2443
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:53.739 
course as some other instructor, you

2444
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.259 
could definitely benefit from

2445
01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:58.089 
the work of an instructional

2446
01:24:58.090 --> 01:24:59.469 
designer that could work an

2447
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:01.449 
assistant to the faculty

2448
01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:02.450 
member.

2449
01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:04.839 
OK, thank you very much.

2450
01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.149 
We are now

2451
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:08.469 
ending this panel.

2452
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.389 
It's now 30 minutes past the hour.

2453
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:12.339 
So I would like to thank the

2454
01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.869 
three great panelists that we have

2455
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.129 
today.

2456
01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:17.069 
Dan Avida, Susanna Sancassani and

2457
01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:18.070 
Marija Verstelle.

2458
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:20.889 
And also the audience.

2459
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:22.929 
So I hope that we can meet

2460
01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:24.399 
in person soon.

2461
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.319 
And well see you somewhere

2462
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320 
in the world.

2463
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:29.379 
Bye bye, then.

2464
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.909 
Thank you very much, Carlos.

2465
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:31.789 
Bye everybody.

2466
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:33.475 
Bye Marija, bye Carlos.

2467
01:25:33.476 --> 01:25:35.039 
Bye  Dan.

2468
01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.040 
Thank you, bye bye. Bye Marija, bye Susanna

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.760 
In this video,

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.280 
I'd like to address together a few
of the question of team dynamics,

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.720 
and we'd like to start
at the very beginning.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.800 
Having composed our team, what do we have?

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.920 
So, first of all, we have also to look
at what we don't have or want to avoid.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.160 
That actually is the classical notion
of a project group,

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.480 
because if you do look at definitions
of what a project group is,

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.360 
it comes down to being a team as a group
of individuals who cooperate and who work

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.760 
together to achieve a given
set of objectives or goals.

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960 
What we would like to introduce to you is

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.360 
actually the concept of a team,
of an innovation team and also more

12
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.440 
specifically, a high
performance innovation team.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.560 
And that goes along with also the
definition given by Katzenbach and Smith

14
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.280 
that actually is as follows.

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.400 
A team can be defined as a small number
of people with complementary skills

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.320 
who are committed to a common purpose,
performance goals and approach

17
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.160 
for which they hold themselves
mutually accountable.

18
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.600 
What's different to the definition
of a group versus team?

19
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.280 
These are three things;

20
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.200 
It's the complementary skills,

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.600 
So you try to really build up on each

22
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.040 
and everybody's different background
and field of expertise and skill set.

23
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.720 
But on the other hand, you are
also committed to the same goal.

24
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.480 
So even if you are about to contribute
different things to this innovation

25
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.680 
project work, you will commit yourself
to move forward all together

26
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.320 
but also holding everybody
mutually accountable for that.

27
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.280 
And that also goes in line
with an understanding,

28
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.960 
a different understanding
of leadership. With group work

29
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.680 
that's sufficient leadership,

30
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.480 
that's more delegation and control.
With innovation teams and teamwork

31
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.960 
It's actually about shared leadership

32
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.280 
and sharing responsibilities
amongst a group of equals.

33
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.640 
However, even if you have created these

34
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.640 
kind of innovation teams based on a good
intention of complementary skills,

35
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.320 
being committed to the same goal
and holding each other accountable

36
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.600 
for the performance of the team,
you will definitely go through a journey

37
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.240 
that will have its dynamics,
that will actually have its emotional up

38
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.120 
and downs, but also its intellectual
and outcome driven ups and downs.

39
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.320 
And that's something we want to have
a further look at, how this model can be

40
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.360 
managed and also shaped. The conceptual
underpinnings in terms of trying

41
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.800 
to explain but also manage these ups
and downs is actually research that ties

42
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.760 
back a couple of decades and it actually
distinguishes five different stages

43
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.080 
a team will go through when it comes

44
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.240 
to its journey concerning creative content
and outcome, but also team dynamics.

45
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.880 
And the five phases are Forming a team,
Storming, Norming,

46
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.480 
Performing, and Adjoining. Within this
prototypical model of a typical team.

47
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.120 
The team starts with Forming,

48
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.400 
getting to know each other and having some

49
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.160 
orientation about who's in the group who will
form that team. At a second stage

50
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.240 
it typically also ends up to be some more

51
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.080 
differentiation in between who has more
power than somebody else, who can

52
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.600 
convince somebody easier
than somebody else.

53
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.040 
And based on solving these conflicts

54
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.480 
typically, a team ends up creating
their own values and norms.

55
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.760 
And that's what Norming is all about.
How can we actually commit ourselves

56
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.160 
to rules that will help us to move forward
into the fourth most important phase,

57
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.560 
that's actually the performing phase. Where

58
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.400 
it's all about achieving commonly agreed
on goals.

59
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.560 
Plus that a teamwork not ends with having
done something, but also includes Adjoining.

60
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.120 
It's not just about saying good bye
to each other,

61
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.760 
but it's also about reflecting on teamwork
and how to take on these learnings

62
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.000 
from that one team you have been
working on into future teams

63
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.160 
you are about to work in..

64
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.960 
What does this different
notion of teams specifically,

65
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.320 
team dynamics will lead us through in
terms of measuring impact. For group work

66
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.120 
we have been talking about PM

67
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.080 
Productivity and Mission of
achieving objectives.

68
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.920 
For innovation teams and the team
model I just have been talking about

69
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.640 
It's about more than P and M, and something
in between that we do actually call our

70
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.240 
PERFORM formula and it
starts with Productivity.

71
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.360 
I'll be getting things done,

72
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.760 
it includes also empathy.

73
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.440 
Do we feel comfortable with each
other within the given team situation?

74
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.000 
Roles:

75
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.680 
How do we reflect on the roles
we are taking in this team?

76
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.080 
Flexibility:

77
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.080 
Do we accept new contributions from other
team members or even from the extended

78
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.480 
team and our decision makers, and are we
also able to iterate on these learnings?

79
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.880 
Openness:

80
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.600 
Do we really say what we think?

81
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.560 
And do we also do what we say?

82
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.600 
And then it's also a Recognition:

83
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.880 
Do we recognize each other as a full team
member and also do we honor each other

84
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.240 
in terms of contributions to the project
work? And last its Mission again.

85
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.240 
So are we committed to a common purpose?

86
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.760 
So if this extended notion of teamwork,
but also with that extend that notion

87
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.640 
of measuring and playing
around with team dynamics;

88
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.960 
we have a far more powerful tool for also
networked organizations to maneuver this

89
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.960 
very fuzzy area of social interactions
and communications and also leadership.

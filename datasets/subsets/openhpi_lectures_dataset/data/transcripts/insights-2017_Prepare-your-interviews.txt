00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:08.990 
Hi everyone! In this video

2
00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:11.990 
I want to talk about how to prepare for your qualitative interview.

3
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.220 
So we tried to talk about who to interview? Where to

4
00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.920 
interview them? And also how to make the interview more comfortable?

5
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.580 
So who should you interview for your topic.

6
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:23.780 
We already talked about users and extreme users,

7
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:26.660 
and that it can be very inspiring to talk to extreme users,

8
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:28.080 
because they have this

9
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.450 
very special relationship with the topic,

10
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.700 
and can make you aware of certain problems.

11
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.080 
So if your topic is about traveling,

12
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:35.770 
why not talk to

13
00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:37.930 
someone who did a journey around the world?

14
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.260 
Or someone who hardly traveled at all?

15
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:44.270 
Of course it can also be inspiring to talk to regular users.

16
00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:45.440 
In the beginning,

17
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.150 
it can be easier to approach

18
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:49.440 
friends or family or colleagues for an interview.

19
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:52.270 
Remember though that it takes time to find someone

20
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:52.900 
you can interview

21
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:55.340 
and also to fix a date for your interviews.

22
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:58.400 
So this might add up on your time schedule for this week.

23
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.720 
If you want to learn about the state of the art of a topic,

24
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.850 
especially if it's a highly specialized topic,

25
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's always good to talk to experts.

26
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:06.940 
For example,

27
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.380 
if your topic is traveling,

28
00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:11.930 
why not talk to someone who works in a travel agency?

29
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:12.950 
Or is a tour guide?

30
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:14.530 
Also try to think about

31
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:18.030 
analogies. Are there people who face similar problems

32
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.920 
or similar situations,

33
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.380 
but in a different context?

34
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:22.680 
For example,

35
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.690 
if you're looking at the

36
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:26.550 
waiting time that travelers spend at an airport,

37
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:30.020 
why not talk to people who wait at the doctor's office?

38
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:31.260 
Or in a supermarket line?

39
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.780 
When you plan for your interview,

40
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:35.890 
you should also think about the location of it.

41
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.460 
Choose a location that's comfortable,

42
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.160 
where you can both sit down and relax, or choose

43
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:42.900 
a location that's related to your topic.

44
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:44.730 
So your interviewee can demonstrate

45
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:46.620 
or point out things during the interview.

46
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.700 
How can you make your interviewee more comfortable

47
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:52.040 
during the talk?

48
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:55.490 
Well, don't forget to introduce yourself! Explain

49
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:56.810 
what you're doing and why

50
00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:58.250 
and what will happen to the information

51
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.460 
you gather. Also explain that you're interested in the opinions

52
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:04.190 
and experiences of your interviewee,

53
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.750 
and that there are no right or wrong answers.

54
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:10.020 
If the person still feels very closed up

55
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:11.090 
after a few minutes,

56
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:13.840 
you can also try to share a personal experience

57
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:16.720 
of yourself from the topic to loosen up the atmosphere a bit.

58
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:19.800 
When you try to come up with the questions for your

59
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.630 
interview, remember the tips from our interviews,

60
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.090 
and also from the cheat sheet

61
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:26.930 
we provide you with. Try to group the questions

62
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:28.350 
according to topics

63
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.190 
and build up a structure that allows for a natural flow of conversation.

64
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:35.420 
But always be open to divert from that structure again,

65
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.860 
if the interview develops into another direction.

66
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:41.700 
Okay, I hope these tips help you for preparing for your interview,

67
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.950 
and that you have fun out there in the field.

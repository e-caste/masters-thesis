00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290 
Hello everyone, welcome to
video clip five point two in

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.770 
which I want to show you how to
analyze business processes.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.340 
When you are imagine you are a
process manager and you have

4
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.980 
you're process owner responsible
for a lot of different

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.370 
processes you want
to figure out

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.880 
for example which of the processes containing
the action with external participants

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.040 
or you get asked the question
by another one can we manage

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.980 
a forty percent increase
of our order volume

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.260 
or a third question could be how
many resources are required

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.630 
if the process will be conducted
eight thousand times a year.

11
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.650 
To answer these kind of
questions you need to

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.920 
use some simulation or some
analysis features which

13
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.270 
can be provided which are provided
by the process manager.

14
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.230 
There are three different
ways to analyze processes.

15
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.210 
The first way would
be simply to

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.700 
search all existing processes for
certain criteria, for example

17
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.220 
you can search the
entire work space

18
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.400 
for the criteria like the
processes where customer

19
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.300 
interactions is happening. Then
you get a list of all processes

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.660 
which you can simply provide to someone
else. Say these are the processes

21
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.930 
in which the customer is sending
something or notified by someone.

22
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.230 
The second way is the way of
reporting so means the way or

23
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.390 
the value or the information you have put
into your processes can be aggregated

24
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.440 
in reports. For example

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.080 
show me all processes where
certainty system is used

26
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.910 
and you want to know and which
a activities which system has

27
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.500 
been has been useful
or was needed.

28
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.880 
The third way is the most powerful
way with which is called

29
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.470 
the process simulation and the
simulation allows you to define

30
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.900 
a set of different scenarios
to yeah lets say to figure

31
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.610 
out if you can if you can handle
these scenarios like a forty

32
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.000 
percent increase of order value
or fifty per cent of your

33
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.800 
customer service employees are sick
at home and can can we see it

34
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.290 
you want to answer the question if
you can still handle the incoming

35
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.370 
amount of requests for example this
helps to identify bottlenecks peaks

36
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.110 
list of the resource
consumption and so on.

37
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.320 
Simulation can deliver insights
on a lot of different

38
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.100 
I would say yeah important
points in the process.

39
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.570 
One of them could be the behaviour. It
simply wants to know how the process

40
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.240 
behaves in some cases

41
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.090 
where we have decision points
where happens something parallel

42
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.540 
and you can click through the process to
visualize this behavior to someone else

43
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.670 
or for someone else. You can also
analyze the cycle time for

44
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.540 
certain cases. So for example you
want to analyze the cycle time

45
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.600 
for one particular case in which
for example the case needs

46
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.190 
to be reviewed by the by the managers
incoming insurance request

47
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.970 
needs to be reviewed by the
manager and the manager decides

48
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.610 
that the case needs to be rejected.
This is a very particular

49
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.890 
execution of the process and you
want to figure out what the

50
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.610 
cycle time is for this
particular case.

51
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.420 
You can also find bottlenecks
if multiplication needs to be

52
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.690 
executed systems shows you directly
on which points of the process

53
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.480 
you could have bottlenecks and it
depends on the workings or the

54
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.510 
work schedule of the employees
depends on the execution times

55
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.540 
but in total you're able to figure
out if you can handle two

56
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.310 
hundred scenario two hundred
incoming cases a week or not.

57
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.970 
You can use the data for resource
planning and optimization so if you

58
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.140 
if you know how long a process
takes or how long two hundred

59
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.690 
instances take and how
much or how much it is

60
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.650 
you can use it for your internal
calculations actually.

61
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.580 
You can also list up average cost and time
so you are interested in the average

62
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.150 
cost and times of all cases which
has been executed in a week

63
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.250 
and then you can also use a simulation
for that and most powerful

64
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.930 
thing is you can create different what
if scenarios in order to compare them

65
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.240 
with each other. So as I have
said what happens if order

66
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.010 
increased by forty percent what's yeah
when we compare these both scenarios

67
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.710 
where the differences how much
more or what are the total costs

68
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.320 
in comparison to the previous scenario
for example or what's the difference.

69
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.330 
Simulation can be activated
when you click on the process

70
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.810 
and when you select a process and
use the edit function. And in

71
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.780 
the edit function you have
the third point which

72
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.750 
allows it to simulate
the BPMN diagram.

73
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.670 
After clicking on that you will be
forwarded to the simulation feature

74
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.840 
and you will find three different
ways where types of simulation

75
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.780 
be offered by Signavio process manager. The
first one is the step through simulation

76
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.740 
where you can simply click on each
activity which needs to be executed

77
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.580 
to visualize someone else
the I would say the flow

78
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.620 
the flow of the sequence
of activities.

79
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.370 
No cost and times are considered
here you can simply or you

80
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.090 
simply visualize the
flow of activities.

81
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.690 
The one case
simulation simulates

82
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.560 
one specific execution of the
process in one particular

83
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.310 
one particular I would say pass
which needs to be executed.

84
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.290 
You are interested in the cost and
times for this particular execution

85
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.370 
so like as I have mentioned the
customer sends the request

86
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.510 
you need to do your
steps and in the end

87
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.500 
you want to figure out how
long it takes until the

88
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.120 
this request gets to be processed.
So the car is insured in

89
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.650 
the end. For example how long does
it takes without any exception to

90
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.610 
yeah to execute this
particular instance.

91
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.800 
The most powerful simulation is
the multiple case simulation

92
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.740 
and this is what we will use in one
minute but here we have the possibility

93
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.660 
to analyze an entire week
for example by considering

94
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.070 
the probabilities of executions
or means how likely is

95
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.190 
said that this

96
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.150 
activity after gateway will be
executed, how many percentage

97
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.540 
of all cases will go to
the other direction,

98
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.720 
you will also need to consider
the executing resources,

99
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.650 
how many reasons do we have
executing the process and what

100
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.870 
are the costs and
times behind them.

101
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.110 
Therefore to be more practical I will
like to jump into the process manager.

102
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.530 
Click on the insurance request process
we have modelled in the previous video

103
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.430 
and click on edit. And here we are
able to jump into the simulation.

104
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.620 
And I'd like to jump to the
multiple case simulation because

105
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.080 
here we are able to
simulate an entire week

106
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.940 
by considering the cost to total
cycle times or resource consumption

107
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.400 
and if we have one also
the bottlenecks.

108
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.620 
Since we need some
values to simulate

109
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.180 
a lot of instances lot of cases,
I'd like to scroll down a bit

110
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.010 
in order to show you
where you can put in

111
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.070 
the required values.

112
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.090 
Here we have the cost I
would say the costs or the

113
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.450 
button to define the costs
behind the process,

114
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.940 
the execution costs
for example

115
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.110 
I've decided to let a zero
because the cost will be caused

116
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.890 
by the executing employees
and not by the

117
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.150 
activity itself not by the
fixed costs for the activity.

118
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.170 
But I have felt some ways in the
duration tab and the duration

119
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.820 
tab allows you to
put in or provide

120
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.900 
the duration for each single activity right.
So here record insurance information

121
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.220 
takes us one minute, check insurance
criterias takes us four and

122
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.850 
so on, to review the case takes
a bit more a more longer,

123
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.500 
takes ten minutes
and so on.

124
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.270 
We have also waiting time. The customer
doesn't answer me after five

125
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.080 
days of waiting time so this
also this could could lead to

126
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.660 
to bottleneck because all the
instances needs to wait at this

127
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.890 
point if the customer
doesn't doesn't answer.

128
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.450 
On the frequency button we are able
to define the actual frequency

129
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.340 
of the rather the cases of the
process so here we would say or

130
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.240 
we've said that the process will
be executed from monday to

131
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.650 
friday from
nine to five

132
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.380 
twenty times a day
which makes a total

133
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.390 
a hundred times a week, because it is
multiplied with five working days.

134
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.110 
And we can even be more
precisely we can say

135
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.410 
how likely is it as a contract
get accepted by the customer

136
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.490 
or gets rejected or no one answers or the
customer doesn't answer after five days.

137
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.040 
And for each single outgoing
sequence flow after gateway you

138
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.120 
can set a probability
how likely it is

139
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.450 
this path will
be executed.

140
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.230 
That applies also to the
result of the case review

141
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.340 
means we talk about this gateway now
how likely is it that how often

142
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.060 
get the case approved, what
the percentage value here

143
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.150 
and how many cases gets
rejected as percentage.

144
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.650 
So many go this
way or this way.

145
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.630 
And I've said that we the case
gets approved in eighty percent

146
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.870 
of all cases after entering the
case review and gets rejected

147
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:54.730 
in twenty percent.

148
00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.950 
We have even one gateway more
which is actually the first one.

149
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.450 
I've said that fifty percent of all
customers are directly eligible

150
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.380 
for insurance thirty percent are not
eligible and twenty percent of all cases

151
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.110 
will end in
case review.

152
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.220 
So it goes this
this way

153
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.120 
and fifty percent goes this way and the
other thirty percent go directly to

154
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.920 
not eligible. This
is what the

155
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.640 
what the numbers are.

156
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.270 
There's only one last thing to
consider before we can start

157
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.600 
a simulation. We need
to define how many

158
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.150 
employees are executing the process
because this is an effect of

159
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.610 
or this has an effect to the total
cycle time because when we

160
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.700 
have more than one employee
executing for example the

161
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.360 
process then they can work
in parallel. Parallelity

162
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.580 
reduces the entire cycle time
because they don't have

163
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.430 
to wait for each other.

164
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.920 
For the moment we said that we have only
one case worker and one manager working

165
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.360 
fourteen hours per week

166
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.830 
or more specifically the working
from monday to friday nine

167
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.020 
to five so exactly the simulation
time eight hours a day

168
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.270 
makes forty hours
a week for both

169
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.830 
and after this has been defined
we can start a simulation.

170
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.670 
Let's go to the start of the
process click on play.

171
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.830 
And what we can see here now is that the
process has been executed hundred times

172
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.120 
and hundred percent of all cases
have been executed already

173
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.430 
in the first and second activities
so this is what the blue

174
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.640 
progress bar tells me

175
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.680 
and now we have the percentage here
which applies. So twenty one percent

176
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.260 
or twenty percent
basically

177
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.510 
end up in review case and here
we have another percentage

178
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.390 
that tells me the prepare letter of rejection
has been executed thirty two times

179
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.760 
because we get

180
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.520 
the cases from the result where the
insurance hasn't been eligible

181
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.000 
and we get the case the
rejected cases by the manager

182
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.440 
and this sums up to
thirty two cases.

183
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.230 
And in the end we can say
the process was executed

184
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.420 
two hundred times a hundred times
and for this hundred times

185
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.950 
thirty two cases and a
later of rejection sent,

186
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.570 
fifty five times the car gets
insured, thirteen times

187
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.130 
the rejection so the customer rejected
the contract and we've sent

188
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.700 
the rejection as we have
confirmed the rejection.

189
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.660 
This is basically what
the simulation tells me

190
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.420 
and that sums up the most important
part here to his total costs

191
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.890 
of eight hundred thirty two
euro and a total cycle

192
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:55.650 
time of yeah one day means twenty four
hours and eighteen additional hours

193
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.610 
which takes or which which have been
necessary to execute all hundreds

194
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:06.280 
cases by all people we have or
were working in the process.

195
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.470 
And now I want to figure
out what happened

196
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:20.520 
if the incoming requests are increased
by a hundred percent. So we get

197
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.950 
we don't execute hundred requests anymore
we want to execute two hundred.

198
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.660 
Are we still able
to handle it?

199
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.200 
Therefore I create
a new scenario.

200
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:36.580 
Clicking on the plus sign let
me create a new scenario

201
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.700 
but I don't want to define all
these again, I want to use

202
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.520 
the one which already
exists and it can say

203
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.150 
one hundred percent.

204
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.050 
That's the name of the scenario
one percent increased

205
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.630 
a request increased
amount of request.

206
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.050 
And what I want to change now is we need
to change the frequency because you said

207
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.280 
the amount is one hundred percent
increased so we do not talk about twenty

208
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.680 
cases per day anymore we
talk about fourteen.

209
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.420 
I click on save and now we have
defined a new scenario which can be

210
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.280 
used for simulation.
So we switch

211
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.350 
the scenario to
the new one,

212
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:38.060 
click on play and now the system
tells me that's actually

213
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.020 
um yeah that leads to
a problem because

214
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.050 
as we can see here the blue
dots indicates every incoming

215
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.010 
case or every incoming requests
which couldn't be executed.

216
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.780 
So it means we have been or
the case has been able to

217
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.290 
execute one hundred eighty four cases
but there are still sixteen cases

218
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.200 
which couldn't be executed so at
least we have a bottleneck here.

219
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.110 
The hundred percent workload
the caseworker can't handle

220
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.600 
any more cases then one
hundred eighty two

221
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.400 
but yeah that indicate that we
have a bottleneck even here.

222
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.880 
The second activity
only one hundred

223
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.610 
eighty three could be executed one
is still waiting to be executed

224
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.520 
and in the end
we can say

225
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.320 
we have been able to a we have
been able to execute the

226
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.310 
process I would say hundred hundred
two times plus ninety times

227
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.210 
plus sixty one times leads to
missing cases of eighteen.

228
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.900 
So eighteen cases hasn't been
executed. There are two ways to

229
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.850 
solve the bottleneck
now. One way would be

230
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:50.600 
we find a way to execute the
decisions the tasks faster so we

231
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.270 
or more efficiently
I would say.

232
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.150 
The other way would be if we can't do
that we need to hire more people

233
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.970 
to handle the scenario.

234
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.110 
And to do so I would go down to
the resources and increase

235
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.320 
the number of
caseworkers.

236
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.630 
Now we could you could play around
with numbers you could say either we

237
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.580 
hire a new caseworker or additional
caseworker which has the same

238
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.480 
work schedule forty
hours a day a week

239
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:24.790 
or we set a different work schedule.
For example we hire working students

240
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:30.560 
who only works from monday
to wednesday only from

241
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.770 
nine to two for example. Then we can also
define another working work schedule here.

242
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.500 
But let's keep it simple for the
first we simply want to increase

243
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.040 
the number of
caseworkers.

244
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.490 
So we have eighty hours a week now
in total for the caseworkers.

245
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.880 
The manager stays

246
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.780 
as it is. Now let's check
if we can handle it now.

247
00:16:55.050 --> 00:17:00.050 
Yeah and the bottleneck where
the all waiting as it is could

248
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.340 
or have been executed now with no
bottleneck anymore looks good so far.

249
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.710 
Two hundred cases
have been executed,

250
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.210 
forty eight ok now we have to
percentages but in the end it says

251
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.880 
there's no bottleneck anymore. So
all cases could have been executed

252
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.310 
and what you can see here right
now is that we always compare

253
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.700 
the current one of simulation
with the last one and this

254
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.460 
shows perfectly that the process
costs have been increased.

255
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.590 
Of course we have hired a new
person but also that the

256
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.300 
cycle time has been
reduced because we've

257
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.480 
the the one case
worker would have

258
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.080 
would need forty four days to
execute all two hundred cases

259
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.070 
and with a new additional case worker we
would be able to do that in four days.

260
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.830 
Which is a massive
reduction I would say.

261
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.970 
So the process only two hundred a
bit more two hundres twenty rule

262
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.860 
more expensive than the previous
the previous simulation but

263
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.540 
we can reduce the
cycle time a lot.

264
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.680 
It is actually the power of simulation you
can play around with different scenarios

265
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.240 
change of numbers were necessary
to show someone else

266
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.330 
what would happen if
yeah if something

267
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.270 
needs to be changed in the
process or something would

268
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.110 
change without having any
risk in the execution.

269
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.260 
That concludes

270
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:35.190 
basically video five point two about
process analysis. You've learned

271
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.460 
how to how to simulate a process,
where to change the numbers,

272
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.010 
and how to compare difference
scenarios and play round with some

273
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.880 
yeah with different resources
and to avoid bottlenecks.

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.990 
Welcome to video clip 2 in which
we provide an overview of DMN.

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.980 
In the previous video clip we
learned about decision management

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.350 
and we motivated
decision management.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.210 
We learn that the goal of decision management is
to model well defined operational decisions

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.310 
thereby improving transparency,
maintainability and also supporting

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.720 
change in automation
of the decisions.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.410 
In decision management we like to
answer a number of questions of who

8
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.250 
is the or how is the decision taken, which
data is being used during decision taking,

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.080 
which policies are taken into account
and actually who is responsible

10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.220 
for taking the
decision.

11
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.650 
The DMN - the decision model and
notation has been introduced

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.450 
to answer these questions.
DMN is an OMG standard that

13
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.750 
considers two levels
of abstraction.

14
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.130 
And the decision requirements
level can be regarded

15
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.850 
as a business level which is used to define
the structure of decisions. So inputs

16
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
of the decisions and relationships
between decisions and as we see

17
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.680 
a few other concepts.

18
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.680 
We are also able to define
decision logic in DMN and

19
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.980 
that defines basically exactly
how decisions are taken. For

20
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.900 
instance we can use decision tables
to define the decision logic.

21
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.890 
Discussing the relationship
between DMN and BPMN - DMN

22
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.110 
I'd like to say that DMN very
nicely complements BPMN. So

23
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.280 
in BPMN you have a decision
task and in DMN you can go

24
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.530 
to the details of how the decision
task is modelled and how it

25
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.450 
is realized or
implemented.

26
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.930 
That DMN can also be
used without BPMN.

27
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.480 
Example one looks at a process
from the insurance sector.

28
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.920 
We introduced that in the
previous video clip

29
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.370 
and here we have activities for
determining debts and history

30
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.050 
on the employment history and we
use these two information pieces

31
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.740 
to determine the credit rating
that might be A or B or C.

32
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.170 
From a decision management point
of view we have one decision

33
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.080 
that takes actually
two inputs.

34
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.660 
And that is what we can represent in
decision requirements diagrams.

35
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.580 
So here in the lower part we have
a decision requirements diagram

36
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.330 
where rectangles
represent decisions.

37
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.560 
Here the decision
determine credit rating

38
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.890 
and the input shapes here we see
the debt and the employment

39
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.910 
history in these two symbols
represent represent the

40
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.280 
input to the decision and with
these arcs with these directed

41
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.120 
arcs we can see that in order
to take this decision

42
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.110 
we will need a debt information and we
need employment history information.

43
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.790 
So decision requirements diagrams model
mainly the structure of decisions

44
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.640 
and also the input
of decisions.

45
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.370 
We can also define decision
logic as I indicated before

46
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.420 
using decision tables. We will
go to the decision to decision

47
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.510 
tables in detail in a bit
later during this week.

48
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.790 
But also here we have a table
where the columns of the

49
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.480 
table are the inputs to the
decision so here we have a column

50
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.000 
for debt and a column
for employment history

51
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.430 
and one column is the output
represents the output and

52
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.250 
the decision table tells us
exactly which input combinations

53
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.650 
lead to which output of the
decision. So for instance

54
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.350 
if the debt is low and the
employment history is good then

55
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.740 
the credit rating is A.

56
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.980 
If the debt is low and the employment
history is bad the output

57
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.680 
of the decision is credit
rating B and so forth.

58
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.630 
So we see that we can capture the
information that we previously

59
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.580 
tried to express in a process model, and
in a very concise way we can define that

60
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.170 
in a decision table.

61
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.600 
We have another example for a
decision that is actually

62
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.950 
based on this collaboration diagram
this BPMN collaboration diagram

63
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.950 
and you can think about are well it's an
insurance claim process where a client

64
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.550 
sends an insurance claim for instance
after her bike was stolen.

65
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.460 
An insurance claim is sent to
the insurance company where

66
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.060 
the claim is received, the
claim is registered,

67
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.260 
then a decision task decide on
claim coverage is executed and

68
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.510 
depending on the outcome of
the decision either a letter

69
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.690 
of approval is
prepared and sent

70
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.960 
or in case the outcome is no we
prepare a letter of rejection

71
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.210 
and reject the claim.

72
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.220 
In BPMN we can add data objects
we did so far we did not

73
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.730 
look at data objects in detail
so we'll introduce data

74
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.100 
objects in BPMN
at this point.

75
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.800 
So yeah BPMN data is represented
by so called data objects.

76
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.190 
Data objects can be related to
activities by dashed arrows

77
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.240 
and these dashed arrows represent
whether the data object is read

78
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.350 
by an activity or whether it
is written by an activity.

79
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.520 
We can illustrate this concept
in the in the process model

80
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.110 
that we see here where we have
a data object called claim

81
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.050 
and by the association we see that
the register claim activity rights

82
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.810 
of the data
object claim.

83
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.560 
The data object claim is then read by
decide on claim coverage activity.

84
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.710 
In fact it is a decision task
and therefore we can express

85
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.930 
here that the claim data object is
used for taking the decision.

86
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.500 
So we can answer almost one
question saying that which data

87
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.270 
has been used here.

88
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.740 
And the lower part we see another
data object called customer

89
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.610 
contract that is also
read by that decision.

90
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.470 
And we see here also data
store or database called

91
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.750 
customer database and with adding
these types of information to

92
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.080 
process model we can also
hint implementation saying

93
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.390 
that a customer contract is
stored in a database called

94
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.480 
customer database in
this in this example.

95
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.060 
We can now for that example
introduce decision requirements

96
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.650 
diagram. So and we do that here
in the lower left to see

97
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.360 
here so again we have one symbol
representing the decision

98
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.730 
and here we have three inputs. So we
have one input called claimed value,

99
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.130 
we have another input called
claim.theft type and here

100
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.580 
we have another input called
customer contract.type.

101
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.440 
And here we see that the granularity
of the input data in the

102
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.250 
decision requirements diagram is a
bit different from the granularity

103
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.350 
of the data objects in
the process model.

104
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.250 
And here we refer to the attributes
of data objects or claim.value

105
00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.620 
means the value attributes
of the data object claim.

106
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:06.130 
And here we refer to the theft time
attribute of the data object

107
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:12.190 
claim and here we refer to the type
of the of the data object customer

108
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:18.580 
contract. Alright so we see that
there is a mismatch here so we need

109
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.400 
additional information to provide
that and that is still part

110
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.840 
of design and part of implementation.
So it's not, we cannot

111
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.530 
automatically derive decision
requirements diagrams from process

112
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.290 
model but we need additional information
basically on the structure

113
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.530 
on the structure of the data
objects being involved.

114
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.100 
On the other hand we see also
that we have some reference,

115
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.720 
some links between these two
models so that here we have

116
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.480 
the term claim and here we have
the claim and here we have

117
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.800 
a customer contract and here we
have customer contract so we

118
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.250 
actually do have for certain link
formal link if you want between

119
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.120 
these two models.

120
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.500 
Finally I'd like to come
through to the second level

121
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.380 
provided by DMN that is the
decision logic level.

122
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.810 
And here the lower part you see a
decision table and the decision table

123
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.310 
provides the decision logic for the
bike theft example introduced early.

124
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.800 
So for each input data
input that we have here

125
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.400 
we have one column. So here
is the column claim value,

126
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.250 
here we have the column
claim.theft type,

127
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.670 
here we have the column
customer contract.type.

128
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.470 
We have an additional column and that
is the output of the decision.

129
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.970 
I'm not going to the very detail
here but just tell you about

130
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.040 
the logic or the semantics
that we have here.

131
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:56.550 
So here the F stands for
first hit policy, so

132
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:01.470 
we look first at row one. If
that matches we are done if

133
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.030 
that not matches we go to
the next and so forth.

134
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.870 
So that this table tells us that
if the claim value is between

135
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:15.070 
zero and two hundred regardless of the
theft time and regardless of that

136
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.290 
of the customer contract types
or when there is these hyphens

137
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.810 
as regardless so don't
care for the value,

138
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.090 
then we cover we cover the claims,
so we say yes as a result.

139
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.420 
Between two hundred one and five hundred
that's only true for gold customers,

140
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.580 
between two hundred one and five
hundred one if you are a silver

141
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.640 
customer it's only provided covered
between six hours and twenty two hours.

142
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.390 
If you're bronze customer it
is only covered in a smaller

143
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.710 
smaller time frame between eight
in the morning and six in the

144
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:55.070 
afternoon. And if it's
a more valuable bike

145
00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.480 
between five hundred one and
thousand euros value for a

146
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.290 
gold customer it is covered between
six and twenty two hours and for

147
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.810 
silver customers between eight
and eighteen hours. So again in

148
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.940 
a smaller time window
if you want.

149
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.790 
If none of these match if none
of these rows match then we

150
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.170 
come to the last one which is some
kind of default if you want

151
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.700 
so that means otherwise if none
of the other rules match

152
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.660 
we will say no and we
cannot cover that damage.

153
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.780 
So that's an example of how you can
express in a very detailed very

154
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.330 
formal way the decision logic
and you can use the outcome

155
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.980 
of the decision then in your
in the process model.

156
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.130 
This brings us to the end of video
clip two where we provided

157
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.100 
an overview of DMN. We looked
at decision requirements

158
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.690 
diagram that we can use to model the
structure of decisions and we also

159
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.590 
took a first look on decision
logic which allows us to express

160
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.920 
how decisions
are taken.

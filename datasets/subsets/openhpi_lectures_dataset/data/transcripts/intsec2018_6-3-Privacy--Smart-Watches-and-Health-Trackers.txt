1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.216 
We discuss now privacy aspects in the context of usage

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.530 
of smartwatches and health trackers.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.720 
Beside of smartphones, such smart watches, such health and fitness trackers are

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
steady companions of our daily life.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.859 
So, these devices, smartwatches

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
and health and fitness tracker collect even more data than smartphones.

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.879 
They have more sensors, sensors which are dedicated for

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.829 
some special services and they also collect data, for

9
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.297 
example, various health data, sleep monitoring, blood to oxygen,

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.579 
heart rhythm, the activity data, for example,

11
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.770 
a pedometer, location data if GPS is

12
00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:57.630 
available, and all this data, which are often very close to our

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.114 
health and to our feelings.

14
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.702 
This data need to be sent via the

15
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.909 
cloud behind these devices to the

16
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.000 
device and application provider.

17
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.150 
This data, the sensor data, they are sent

18
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.959 
to the device and an application provider.

19
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.980 
And then on that place, the data are processed

20
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.930 
and then the results are sent back to the users.

21
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.680 
So, many new fitness and health trackers can be managed

22
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.199 
partly exclusively only by the manufacturer's website

23
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.360 
and show person the statistics and results only when connected

24
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.829 
to that website.

25
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.197 
So,the tracker needs to synchronise data to

26
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.830 
ensure even basic functionality.

27
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.870 
The default settings of such devices are often not ideal

28
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.809 
for data privacy.

29
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.710 
The provider wants to get as much data as possible

30
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.599 
to process them and to provide their service, for example,

31
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.129 
about any kind of information for their

32
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.249 
body status and others.

33
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.162 
To give an example, the PolarFlow web page, this

34
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.469 
is a web page of a fitness tracker.

35
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.839 
This is a device manufacturer of a fitness

36
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.610 
tracker and on their website, the name,

37
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.919 
the photos, the city are always public of the users

38
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.539 
of their devices. So, if the privacy of sporting activity is

39
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.009 
not limited, every logged in user time,

40
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.110 
even those without a polar device can see training data,

41
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.604 
including running routes and other really very

42
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.090 
personal data.

43
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.379 
So, the risk of such connected fitness data is that fitness

44
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.080 
and health applications and gadgets are major trends in the market.

45
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.770 
There are trends for such mobile apps, people love it

46
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
and are not aware that this can only operate

47
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.520 
in the right way if all their very personal data are

48
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.830 
sent to the vendor of the device.

49
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.896 
So, dozens of different trackers are on the market, body scales,

50
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.519 
blood measure, blood pressure measurements and many other very

51
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.139 
deep body functionality are

52
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.719 
measured and with Bluetooth or with App integration

53
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.699 
and are submitted to the app

54
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.139 
provider. So, hundreds of different apps, for example, training

55
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.610 
protocols or nutrition diaries collect data.

56
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.289 
Health apps are increasingly interconnected, allowing, for example, the checking

57
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.639 
of all connected fitness and body data in one app.

58
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.379 
And if all this data get in the wrong hands,

59
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.089 
then also the wrong hands and the attacker behind is

60
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.649 
able to see all this data.

61
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.287 
And new, deeper problem

62
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.429 
comes from the fact that all this combination of different

63
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.860 
such data allows extensive analysis for manufacturers

64
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.509 
or third parties with interest in that data.

65
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.649 
So, not only the data themselves, but also the interconnection and the combination

66
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.115 
of data from different sources provide a problem.

67
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.708 
So, data privacy and storage location is often unknown.

68
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.779 
So, it's unclear if you investigate the application, what are the

69
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.499 
data privacy rules this application is following.

70
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.881 
Sometimes they are really not detectable that

71
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.699 
for example, the data is provided also to other parties.

72
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.123 
It's not clear where the data are stored, whether this is

73
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.759 
in a secure environment or whether it is in a way I went

74
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.069 
easy to access for and also reside person.

75
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.119 
So this remains often unknown and in that sense,

76
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.416 
it's a real problem when health data are

77
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.769 
not confidential. So, data protectors advocate

78
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.309 
a caution with fitness trackers for that reason.

79
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.661 
Also, health insurances might be interested in the data, in

80
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.769 
the data that are collected, for example, to modify their offer

81
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.392 
for a customer. Here's an example, Generali Vitality

82
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.110 
is a pay scale where insurance customers

83
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.350 
receive bonuses for healthy lifestyle.

84
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.209 
In order to check this, in order to control this the

85
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.950 
insurance company needs access to such training data.

86
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.959 
UnitedHealthCare another insurance cooperates with

87
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.759 
Qualcomm to provide employees with free activity trackers

88
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.599 
for monetary benefits.

89
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.390 
In Germany, for example, the government data protection commissioners

90
00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.009 
fear a weakening of the solidarity principle in health care.

91
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.670 
If you say that this is a healthy person, this is

92
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.914 
an output of the analysis of the data, then the healthy person are

93
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.996 
offered contracts with lower payment

94
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.019 
and if they find out at hand of the health data that the person

95
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.000 
is often ill, then they they offer a contract

96
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.573 
with higher cost. So, the solidarity principle,

97
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.339 
which says everyone pays the same and in

98
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.310 
this way, society helps that there is solidarity

99
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.660 
in the usage of the means and the money and the health care costs.

100
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.650 
With kind of such a very deep investigation, which

101
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.027 
is so easy by such health trackers

102
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.950 
that this principle is no more valid in future.

103
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.103 
So, responsible users currently have to consider the data

104
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.236 
protection themselves.

105
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.145 
So, check privacy policies of the device, check privacy

106
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.779 
policy of the app providers, check what are the rules,

107
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.284 
what the provider does with your data, whether,

108
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.949 
for example, they also sells the data to third parties, also thinks

109
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.123 
this is a responsibility of the person to check this.

110
00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:36.642 
And on the basis of that knowledge one

111
00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.923 
should make informed decisions before one is starting to

112
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.380 
use such kind of equipment.

113
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.249 
There are, of course, advantages, it's very helpful, for example, to

114
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.043 
have this training data but you should be clear that this

115
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.219 
data are not only known to you that this data are

116
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.226 
always in cloud, also known to the

117
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.539 
app provider, to the company that produces the devices.

118
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.423 
They need this data to offer you the service they promised

119
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.469 
but you should find out how, in

120
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.850 
which way they deal with your data and if it's not clear,

121
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.710 
how, then you should look for another app or another provider.

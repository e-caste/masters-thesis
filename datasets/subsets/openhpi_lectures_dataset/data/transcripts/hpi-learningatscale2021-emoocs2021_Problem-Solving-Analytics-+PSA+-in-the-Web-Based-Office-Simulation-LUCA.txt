00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.480 
welcome everybody to our video presentation on problem solving

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.650 
analytics in the web-based of the simulation luca.

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.460 
in this three minute presentation we will outline key features

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.190 
of teaching and learning with luca and we will show you how

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.650 
problem solving analytics supports learning with luca. my name is sabrina

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.460 
and my name is andreas.

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.460 
lukas a web-based office simulation for learning business related

8
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.260 
content by solving authentic work scenarios in an authentic environment.

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.860 
luca supports face to face learning as well as synchronous

10
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.990 
and asynchronous distance learning. it is also very flexible

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.460 
content wise because teachers and trainers can either use are

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.190 
ready to use work scenarios or create their own scenarios. LUCA

13
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.410 
office simulation is divided into the following three main

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.980 
areas. in the luka editor you are welcome to create a model

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.300 
company and work scenarios or you can choose from existing content.

16
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.650 
you can integrate your own material such as pdf videos or access

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.810 
and refine emails from fictive employees into scenarios.

18
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.350 
learn us titled these scenarios in the luka office they get

19
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.860 
an invitation registered to the platform and acquire competences.

20
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.440 
by solving authentic scenarios in a simulated workplace typically

21
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.080 
scenario start with an incoming mail sent by colleague.

22
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.790 
leaners then have to distinguish between relevant documents and irrelevant ones

23
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.790 
carry out calculations within a spreadsheet program retrieve

24
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.820 
data from an erp system weigh our different solutions and communicate

25
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.040 
their solutions in an email. events allow you to ask learners

26
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.540 
about their current progress and based on their answers pre-defined

27
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.310 
emails with additional information will be triggered.

28
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.180 
additional interventions can be triggered by real time data analysis of problem-solving.

29
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.410 
problem solving analytics the psa detects whether learners overlook

30
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.460 
relevant information commit calculation errors or leave out

31
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.850 
relevant arguments in that email reply.

32
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.320 
the luca monitor allows you to create projects and white lorna's,

33
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
during class you can monitor your students' progress in a dashboard

34
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.510 
based on real time peers a indicators and you can see snapshots

35
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.160 
of their intermediate solutions. you can react and provide direct

36
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.040 
spontaneous support and feedback via a chat feature.

37
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.180 
focused on how locked data based indicators predict problem

38
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.820 
solving and how interventions support learning.

39
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.570 
lucas speaks german and english and it is an open educational resource

40
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.460

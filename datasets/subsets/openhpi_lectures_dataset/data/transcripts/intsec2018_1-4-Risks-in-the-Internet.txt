1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.510 
Now we want to discuss the
risks in the internet.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.820 
We already mentioned the
commercial use of the internet

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.050 
leads to a significant increase in
the number of computer attacks

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.600 
and criminal activities, it is
so attractive on the one side

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.360 
and other side so easy to
use to misuse the internet

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.280 
to attack services or systems.
Here is a chart which shows

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.840 
that in U.S. more than three
million complaints have been

8
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.390 
logged with the FBI
since the year 2000.

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.500 
So this is the internet crime complaint
center which was introduced

10
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.510 
and this shows a kind of statistics
but these are only

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.410 
the attacks that
are reported

12
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.700 
to this internet crime
complaint center. This

13
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.510 
is definitely not the
real number of attacks.

14
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.580 
Now we have to see
what are the risks

15
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.900 
in the digital world
and what can be done.

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.440 
Computers, laptop, smart
devices, end systems and all

17
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.300 
they provide risk. They provide
risk using the internet and

18
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.320 
then the connection of these
end devices with the internet

19
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.650 
provides another
family of risk

20
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
and then third the use of the
internet technology inside

21
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.820 
a business network or inside
an institution network

22
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.900 
in so called intranets
provide a risk.

23
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.320 
In the progressing of
electronic information

24
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.750 
even without connection
to the internet

25
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.900 
the IT systems, the end
systems provide risk.

26
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.370 
Risk for example that data stored
on these computer systems

27
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.840 
or stored at thir databases
are not available.

28
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.460 
This is a security problem for
example if it's a medical

29
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.780 
service and the data can not
be accessed in case of an

30
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.490 
accident this could be,
life's could depend

31
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.760 
from that. Another risk
is the loss of data

32
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.610 
or the misuse of data, the theft of
data, the manipulation of data

33
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.500 
which are stored in that system
in the computer systems

34
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.320 
or end-systems. Human factor
provides a lot of risk.

35
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.850 
Often unusual, unintentional
but often also intention

36
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.430 
for example the incorrect
configuration of a system

37
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.140 
or an incomplete
configuration of a system,

38
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.380 
missing of data backups
is often a problem that

39
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.310 
people use their end devices,
use a computer system

40
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.160 
store a lot of data but do
not back up this data

41
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.210 
so in case of a failure that
the system is broken or that

42
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.780 
system is damage for
example by malware,

43
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.970 
by a hacker attack,
the data got lost.

44
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.350 
Malicious software
is another

45
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.190 
risk for the usage of
such computer systems.

46
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.570 
The malicious software can
come via emailed attachments

47
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.060 
or via external
devices for example

48
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.750 
connecting a USB
stick to a computer

49
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.640 
or the faulty use for example
unintended deletion of files or

50
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.470 
others. The risk when
connecting an IT system

51
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.660 
to the internet, I can only
mention a few of them.

52
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.100 
For example the infiltration of
malware viruses, worms, trojans -

53
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.380 
we will discuss this in
more detail that when

54
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.540 
over the internet attackers send
for example a fishing mail

55
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.360 
and the user clicks on it, then
such a malware could be

56
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.160 
infiltrated to the end systems, the
system the laptop the users is using

57
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.210 
also tablet or others.
Data loss, data theft,

58
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.250 
the erasure the
falsification of data

59
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.290 
is a risk. Another risk is for a
system that are connected to

60
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.620 
the internet is that
confidentiality is lost.

61
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.100 
This could be interesting for
competing companies if for

62
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.800 
example in the computer
are valuable design

63
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.940 
data are stored or for
parties if some internal

64
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.920 
discussions made
public via

65
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.860 
an internet attack.
Reputation can get lost

66
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.990 
in the public. So there
are in the past attacks

67
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.790 
against famous companies to
blame these companies, to show

68
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.300 
these companies are not even
able to store identity data

69
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.990 
in a correct way. Or the incorrect
use of internet addresses

70
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.240 
by third parties. See in the
internet it's very easy

71
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.430 
to work with fake addresses
or falsified addresses,

72
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.620 
sabotage of system
operations and malfunctions,

73
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.160 
for example the easy attack that
tries to overload a service

74
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.750 
such denial of service
attack can have the result

75
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.130 
that the service is no
more accessible and

76
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.200 
stops to work. So these
are problems at

77
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.280 
risk if systems are
connected to the internet

78
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.500 
and there are similar risks if
inside a company, inside an

79
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.170 
organization the internet technology
is used in form of an intranet.

80
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.290 
Even if this is related
from the internet

81
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.620 
then there are a various number
of security risk, for example

82
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.340 
the unauthorized or the
un desired access

83
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.610 
to confidential information,
for example to the salary

84
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.830 
table of all the employees. And
then it is access to management

85
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.300 
decisions, to personal records
and what is shown by studies

86
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.330 
that many attacks a lot of
misuse of IT system is carried

87
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.610 
out by own employees.

88
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.660 
All information is increasingly
available in electronic forms.

89
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.690 
In the past there was paper and
there were more books and other

90
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.750 
systems now all, if you use
video, if you use audio, if you

91
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.370 
use text, all is available
in electronic form

92
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.600 
and all is available
over the intranet. So

93
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.470 
intranets provide the
possibility to get access

94
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.470 
to a huge variety of information
to all kind of information

95
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.440 
thats available and important
inside a company.

96
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.010 
The archiving systems, the
messaging systems, the voice

97
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.620 
mail system, newsgroups all
is connected to the internet

98
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.350 
and can be attacked
inside an intranet.

99
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.390 
When we discuss risk then of
course the question is how we

100
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.030 
can measure risk. And this is
a very important question

101
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.100 
before one starts to
think about securing

102
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.330 
the own system the own network,
because one has to find out what

103
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.670 
happens if some attacker
successfully attacks my system,

104
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.200 
what happens when the
attacker is able

105
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.640 
to manipulate data, to delete
data. There is a definition -

106
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.740 
definition ISO 31000

107
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:17.160 
which says that risk
has to be viewed

108
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.640 
in two different dimensions.
And these two dimensions

109
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.010 
are the following:

110
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.160 
The first dimension

111
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.690 
is a degree of damage,
what is damage

112
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.860 
if an attacker falsifies
data, if an attacker

113
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.350 
performs a denial of
service attack or others?

114
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.680 
And the other dimension is
the expected frequency

115
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:58.000 
of such an attack. So if you
think, if you want to measure

116
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.970 
the risk of your system, the risk
when you connect your system

117
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.580 
to the internet you have to
consider these two dimensions

118
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.670 
of the risk. The risk in the use of
computer systems and the internet

119
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.980 
have drastically
increased in the years

120
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.930 
as well with respect to
the degree of damage

121
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.840 
as well with the
expected frequency.

122
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.700 
So the question is how one can
perform such a risk analysis

123
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.620 
and typically a risk
analysis takes place

124
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:40.000 
in four phases - phase one is
define the analysis domain.

125
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.630 
So consider a special device,
consider a special connection

126
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.400 
of this device with the
database, consider a special

127
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.270 
IT software for example a
database a special service

128
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:58.040 
and try to characterize
later on the risk for this

129
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.000 
particular domain.
The better

130
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.540 
it is restricted the
better it's possible to

131
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.620 
evaluate risk later on. Of course
then one has to concentrate

132
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.250 
on different points of
different analysis domains

133
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.520 
to get the risk consideration
of the whole system.

134
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.790 
Phase one definition of
analysis domain, phase two

135
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:28.490 
is description of all the risk
in that analysis domain,

136
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.460 
description of the risk. There are
two approaches, the one approach

137
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.080 
is a so called scenario
based approach.

138
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.860 
So one considered a special
scenario if this and this attack

139
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.760 
is happening. What the hacker
could be do with our

140
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.730 
system, if this and this
breakdown of machine happens

141
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.900 
what are the consequences? So you
discuss in form of such serious

142
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.720 
scenarios with the aim to
collect the different risks

143
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:07.320 
that maybe occur. And the other
approach is so called simulation

144
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.880 
based. Here you try to simulate
an attack and try to see what

145
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.970 
happens, for example if this
system does not work,

146
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.190 
what kind of consequences has
this for other systems?

147
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.630 
Then in phase three, one is able
to perform an assessment

148
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.990 
of the acquired
risk, there are

149
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.230 
different possibilities - the one
possibility is that one performs

150
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.780 
a kind of classification according
to the damage potential

151
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.530 
and in prospect to
the probability

152
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.380 
of occurrence. In the
assessment, one can

153
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:02.320 
classify and analyze the
system in different ways.

154
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:09.040 
So one can try to
analyse the results

155
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:16.090 
in for example the value of money
damage, one can try to classify

156
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.330 
in the ordinary way
to say this is very

157
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.460 
heavy or this is heavy or
this is not so important.

158
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:30.120 
And then in the last phase, one is
able to interpret the results.

159
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.440 
One knows in that domain this
and this risk can occur

160
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.400 
they have that and that
problems and one

161
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.900 
can evaluate this risk
and then to interpret

162
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.970 
what for example kind
of security system

163
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.960 
is the right one to do
something against

164
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.840 
the most
dangerous risk.

165
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.880 
There are, let's discuss
some of the risks

166
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:05.750 
which are associated with the
usage of open networks like the

167
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.340 
internet. But we
already mentioned

168
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:15.460 
that even if you use systems
not connected to the internet,

169
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.350 
there are risks. So here
the emphasis is on

170
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:25.770 
so called open networks, you
remember from our introductory

171
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.030 
internet is an open network,
everyone knows the

172
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.010 
construction planes,
everyone knows the

173
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:38.560 
standards, so everyone also
knows how it works and were

174
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:43.590 
eventually are weak points.
Risks are loss of messages

175
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.870 
the falsification of messages,
the falsification of the sender

176
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.270 
address. So
sometimes people

177
00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.290 
performing get the same message
but from different senders.

178
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.320 
From one sender which looks
a very familiar person

179
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.600 
and another from an unknown person,
of course people react in different

180
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.710 
ways but one needs to know that
the internet is very is easy

181
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.370 
to modify to falsify a sender address.
The manipulation, another risk

182
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.300 
is manipulation and fraud in
online shopping system and

183
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.000 
online banking, in all kind of
business usage of the internet.

184
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:34.200 
The illegal or harmful online business
practices are a risk, the violation

185
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.440 
of data protection or the
indeterminancy of rights

186
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.010 
in the cyberspace, all these
provide problems.

187
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.800 
If we look for example to
the forgery of messages

188
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.930 
then without special
protection systems

189
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:54.640 
it is very easy over the internet
to intercept, to change, to

190
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.850 
forward email messages and other
messages with wrong addresses

191
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:04.270 
that can even be
done by people

192
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.020 
without big knowledge,
big know-how.

193
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:15.440 
The integrity and the authenticity,
so that the valid sender

194
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.030 
or that the message
is not modified

195
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.210 
can be ensured with help of
encryption and with suitable

196
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.510 
cryptographic procedures, we
will speak about that but one

197
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:34.260 
is self responsible for doing this.
If we look to online shopping

198
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.190 
and banking which is
nowadays very popular,

199
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.970 
than transactions are usually
secured. For example by encrypting

200
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.510 
connection by chip card by using
virtual private networks or

201
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:52.510 
others. But if the systems
the personal system

202
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:58.360 
is inadequately protected, a
computer is used with a lot of

203
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:04.820 
malware installed then there
is a lot of risk even

204
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.860 
for using such online
shopping and banking

205
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.790 
secured transaction because
the passwords can be stolen

206
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.300 
or transactions can be disclosed.
The use of hidden programs

207
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.750 
like trojan horses to prepare
an unintended transaction

208
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.780 
is possible. So even if
the connection to the

209
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.900 
partner, to the bank, to
the shop is very secured,

210
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.740 
if one performs this
activity on a computer

211
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.440 
that it's not
adequately protected

212
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.440 
then it provides a lot of problems.
Phishing is a another, pharming

213
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.120 
so attacks by via fake
emails and websites

214
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:56.460 
open more doors for attackers.
If you look to illegal and

215
00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.780 
harmful online business practices,
then more and more criminals

216
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.670 
use internet because of the
anonymity in the internet,

217
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.670 
because of the broad
accessibility, because of the

218
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:14.180 
ease to use it. Federal criminal
police office estimates

219
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.460 
that the number of
criminal web pages

220
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:24.440 
in the world is more than
five million. What are these kind

221
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.180 
of a websites, for
example illegal offers

222
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:33.700 
of fake drugs or the
online casinos.

223
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.550 
There is really a big annual turnover

224
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.540 
for more than
two billion

225
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:47.680 
U.S. dollars that is estimated
by such methods for

226
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:54.280 
such online casino activities.
Fraudulent snowball systems provide

227
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.410 
a problem, child
pornography

228
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:02.250 
internet is used for. These
are all illegal harmful

229
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.530 
business relations. Data
protection is another

230
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.780 
area where the use of internet
provides risk, the many online

231
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.640 
services collect personal data,
they need to collect this to

232
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.480 
perform their service for example
address and age and financial

233
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:26.820 
data but some of these companies
sell this collected data

234
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:32.100 
also to other companies. For example,
through lotteries or free

235
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.850 
offers of software or
download, buy something.

236
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:42.790 
The attackers are able to
install, to infiltrate

237
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.220 
malware to the computer or
to the systems of the

238
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:54.000 
users. Often the collected data
is disclosed or sold to other

239
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.520 
providers. So for example such
direct marketing agency and

240
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.690 
you are wondering why a person a
company you never had contact

241
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:09.120 
with them has complete
data about you.

242
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.700 
The internet providers evaluate
internet data streams.

243
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.640 
They need to do this to
connect you to the internet

244
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:22.410 
but of course they also have
to save all connection

245
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.700 
data, so they can see
all your communication.

246
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.380 
They can see and read it as
long as its un-encrypted.

247
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.300 
Each email that is un-encrypted
which is performed over

248
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:42.610 
the internet can seen, can be read
by anyone who access to the

249
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.680 
internet. The note information about
the connection details for the

250
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.830 
transmission of the
encrypted data streams

251
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.190 
that also can be recognized
by the internet providers.

252
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.500 
So you need to be clear
that they have the chance

253
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:04.050 
to see all what you are doing.
Another problem when we speak

254
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:09.650 
about risk and using the internet
is the national jurisprudence.

255
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.310 
So for example here are
some examples from German

256
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:22.440 
jurisprudence. There needs a time
to define new rules which

257
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.500 
prevent and which regulate
activities in the internet.

258
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.510 
So in Germany for example we have
the TMG the German teleservice

259
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.860 
act which creates legal
security on the internet in

260
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.630 
Germany. So for example paragraph
1 of the TMG defines

261
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.830 
the use of electronic information
and communication services

262
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:49.120 
and describes also regulation
of that. So the TMG describes

263
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.450 
when online contracts are
literally binding

264
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.410 
when orders, when letter of
intent and other things.

265
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.590 
There is another
German law - the VDG,

266
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.500 
the German trust service act
which provides conditions for

267
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.730 
the recognition of
digital signatures or

268
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.790 
there are more, for example
is the Strafgesetzbuch

269
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.910 
the so called hacker paragraph which
punish the use and development

270
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.830 
of possible attack
tools. Problem here is

271
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:30.060 
for example for a security audit
and for security education

272
00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.310 
one needs to work with
such tools to teach the

273
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:41.290 
administrators and the people.
But the basic problem of all

274
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:46.370 
these attempts to regulate
the use of the internet and

275
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:52.610 
to make it a more secure place
is this national - these

276
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:58.440 
rules, these regulations only are
valid inside the boundaries

277
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.140 
of a country but the internet
is a global communication.

278
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.090 
So in a global communication
we have only the possibility

279
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.330 
of national
legislation.

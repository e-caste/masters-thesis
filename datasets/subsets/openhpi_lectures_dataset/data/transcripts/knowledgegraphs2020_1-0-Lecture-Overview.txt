00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.410 
Welcome to knowledge graphs, this is
lecture number 1, knowledge graphs

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.400 
in the web of data. As usual, we will first
give you an overview of the lecture.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.270 
So we will start at the beginning
with the question of what's

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.670 
the difference between data
information and knowledge?

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.750 
And then, of course, we also have
to ask ourselves how do we

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
put knowledge into a machine and how
this knowledge can be understood

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.550 
that we are talking about,
the art of understanding.

8
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.070 
Then we are going to see in the
next lecture how do we teach

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.400 
a machine, this art of understanding,
we are going to see this

10
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.930 
in the course of lecture with the
help of knowledge representation

11
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.850 
which then constructs
the semantic web.

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.330 
And of course, we start first with
a small fraction of the semantic

13
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.400 
web, which is called linked data.
So this is only a small amount of

14
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.760 
basic principle architectures and
techniques that are put together

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.130 
to form the so called
web of data. So

16
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.120 
now let's start with Data,
Information and Knowledge.

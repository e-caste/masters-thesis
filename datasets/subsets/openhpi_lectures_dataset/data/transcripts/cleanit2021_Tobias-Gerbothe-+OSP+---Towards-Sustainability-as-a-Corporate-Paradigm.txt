00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:12.160 
Welcome everyone! Welcome back again to our clean-IT openXchange live talk today on the 28th of March.

2
00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:19.640 
My name is Nils König as always and I'm here with Sophie Schönefeldt from clean-IT team at HPI and today's guest with

3
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.429 
us is Tobias Gerbothe.

4
00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:29.559 
Tobias Gerbothe holds a degree in Transport Engineering and started his career in the field of air transport as a research assistant.

5
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.149 
After an initial scientific career focusing on trajectory management in simulation software for aviation,

6
00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:43.259 
he decided to follow his passion for IT
and fully dedicate himself for in the ICT environment.

7
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.159 
Since 2015, he has been working as a software developer at the Otto Group Solution Provider (OSP) with a focus on e-commerce

8
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.859 
and webshop development.

9
00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:59.060 
There he is committed to establishing sustainability as an integral part of all corporate activities.

10
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.930 
He's currently working on building a platform that will provide both knowledge and technological tools to help colleagues

11
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.670 
of his incorporate sustainability as a significant aspect of decision making. In today's talk,

12
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.810 
he will reveal the challenges that are involved when you're trying to fight the climate crisis

13
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.219 
from an IT perspective, he will also talk about the strategy that can make it possible and why this goal can only succeed

14
00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.450 
if companies and their employees both pursue a common goal.

15
00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:28.260 
Everyone welcome with me, Tobias Gerbothe.

16
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.819 
Yeah, thank you very much for the introduction.

17
00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.209 
Let's start the presentation.

18
00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.359 
I hope you can see the screen right now.

19
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.260 
Okay.

20
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.239 
Yeah.

21
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.219 
Welcome to everybody from my side as well.

22
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.319 
Today I'm talking to you as a representative of the OSP,

23
00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.549 
Sustainable Programming Initiative, more specifically the strategic team.

24
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.939 
And what we want to talk about is our overall strategy we want to follow in order to transform OSP to a green IT solution

25
00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:11.460 
provider.

26
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.219 
And furthermore, I want to give you an overview of the instruments we want to apply and examples of tools we reuse. You might know,

27
00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.300 
we are a member of the Otto Group and in fact we are the IT service provider of the Otto Group and involved in many

28
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.060 
high level transformation projects.

29
00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.810 
The Otto Group is committed to economical, social and ecological sustainability for decades.

30
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.849 
And currently digital responsibility has a very high attention for the Otto Group and its members.

31
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.860 
We as OSP are very grateful to be part of the Otto Group and as we have a strong background, get a lot of inspiration

32
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.939 
and are embedded in a healthy culture. For us,

33
00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:58.060 
it's clear that we accept social, economical and ecological responsibility and we believe that our businesses practice must

34
00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:07.960 
be fair and sustainable now and in the future. When we talk about our strategy to establish sustainability within the Sustainable

35
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:16.210 
Programming Initiative, we primarily focus on the mental impact, of course, by our main activities and as a IT service provider,

36
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.310 
our main competence is IT in the area of retail and logistics and our activities include software development, IT consulting

37
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.659 
business intelligence with 450 experts in five locations worldwide.

38
00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:30.349 
That OSP

39
00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.240 
care has been shown by several activities over the last year.

40
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.990 
I want to mention a few of them here.

41
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.060 
So for example, we are purchasing our electricity from a green energy provider.

42
00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:48.759 
We try to reduce our energy compensation as much as we can by utilizing green company equipment.

43
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:59.169 
And we also did our company carbon footprint inventory in last or last year for 2020 for all our German sites and most recently

44
00:03:59.169 --> 00:03:59.949 
also for Spain.

45
00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:10.669 
And over that we want to mitigate our carbon emissions that we have figured out is about 330 tons per year by becoming

46
00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.090 
a carbon neutral company.

47
00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:20.089 
So we bought certificates in order to mitigate it in the short term, but we wanted to do more.

48
00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:29.149 
So, the company decided to invest in a solar powered water kiosk in Burkina Faso to allow the local community to get

49
00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.660 
access to clean drinking water.

50
00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:33.769 
That's all good and we are very proud of it.

51
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:41.819 
But we have also recognized that from an employees' point of view that these actions are kind of limited in their

52
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:48.980 
effectiveness when it comes to what it means to our daily business and our daily decisions made by our colleagues. This slide

53
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:57.790 
should show that you have on the right side, sorry, on the left side company strategic goals that are driven by

54
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.050 
a few persons, few colleagues involved as passive activities.

55
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.060 
And on the other hand, you have the employees on the right hand where almost all the colleagues should be involved on an

56
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.959 
operational level to be more active or authentical

57
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.779 
in the activities. Purchasing green electricity, for example, is something you can also consider external without any direct

58
00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.850 
impact or contribution by the colleagues.

59
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.740 
And we could just say we have a green energy right now so we can use even more electric energy.

60
00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:35.100 
But we will prepare the other way around to encourage the colleagues to build and operate the systems as energy efficient

61
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:42.360 
as possible, as less energy we consume as more renewable energy is available for the others.

62
00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:53.360 
Another example is measuring the company's footprint if it is done once per year as a snapshot, it's okay but we prefer

63
00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.300 
to have it automatically measured over the time with higher granularity to become continuous and then it involves much

64
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.860 
more colleagues and offers the ability to address energy efficiency on an operational level and bring it to the daily business.

65
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:18.259 
An early approach to involve the colleagues was our sustainable programming challenge and the beginning of last year

66
00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:25.899 
and out of this event, the Sustainable Programming Initiative has been formed with the main objective to change over to

67
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.050 
a more internal integral continuous approach on sustainability by convincement.

68
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.069 
So what we are doing with this sustainable initiative? First and foremost, we have defined the vision, we want to become

69
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:48.329 
a company that accepts environmental responsibility, a company where the people are entitled to monitor all the carbon footprint

70
00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:54.060 
of their activities, have the knowledge to reduce it and incorporate the goal of reducing carbon emissions into their everyday

71
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.350 
work.

72
00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.560 
But over it, we also try to develop a plan of how this vision can become reality.

73
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:09.560 
So we know that a lot of colleagues are very keen about sustainability, but it's not easy to incorporate it into the daily

74
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.600 
business and a Sustainable Programming Initiative,

75
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:19.410 
we want to encourage the colleagues, we want to enable and support anybody who's interested in it and promote and share the

76
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:28.240 
vision among all the colleagues and nobody is forced to incorporate it, but we want to make it attracting as possible and

77
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.850 
we want to provide a very low threshold to it.

78
00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:37.459 
So we discovered some instruments we want to apply in order to make it possible.

79
00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:44.449 
This is, for example, we want to provide tools and infrastructure for anybody to become sustainability aware at any time.

80
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:52.610 
So we have a highly motivated tech team to design and implement common infrastructure, support individual technical tools

81
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.139 
and software solutions that are required by our business units or teams.

82
00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:04.980 
And Yeah, first of all, what we did is to provide a tool to measure the energy usage of our CO2 emissions in our

83
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.449 
cloud infrastructure.

84
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.160 
Another point is the empowerment and support of other colleagues.

85
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:17.220 
We want to have regular activities, regular events and we want to enable the colleagues to discover the potential and compare

86
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.120 
different approaches and computational methods against each other to see what the potential really is and also to provide

87
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.360 
real world problems support.

88
00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:32.210 
So we want to see it later if a colleague has an issue and see there's a sustainability issue, we attend to give them

89
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:41.539 
support on this. Community exchange as we did today and as we already did end of last year when a colleague was presented

90
00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.649 
data minimalism in

91
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:45.059 
AI here at Hasso Plattner Institute.

92
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:53.029 
We want to to get an exchange with you not about the few technical stuff but also about strategy and our visions and our

93
00:08:53.029 --> 00:09:00.759 
culture and yeah we have also some other collaboration with Portworx, for example, or some other experts in the field.

94
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.809 
Knowledge management is another step.

95
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:14.070 
We want to provide the basic knowledge with terms and definitions about sustainability and general basic understanding

96
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:19.850 
of how the calculation works, the methodologies that are available and used by common tools.

97
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.159 
We want to provide best practices and guidelines for the whole software development lifecycle.

98
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:35.019 
So, for example, for the developers and we also want to offer courses, lectures and trainings and inspiration is also a very

99
00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:38.509 
important thing for us and we want to share ideas across the IT

100
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.259 
community, not only the hard technical stuff and the scientific research,

101
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:49.950 
we already shared with you and nature and the future but we also want to to motivate each other, collaborate and share

102
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.860 
also our culture.

103
00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:58.559 
Okay, so here you can see how we want to implement or apply these instruments.

104
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:05.539 
Since we are an IT solution provider, most of the colleagues

105
00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:08.750 
are somehow involved in the software development lifecycle.

106
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:17.539 
We want to apply this instrument into each phase and facilitate each phase individually and for each phase we actually

107
00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:21.850 
have several of experts with many years of operational expertise.

108
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.450 
And we want to use this operational expertise as a Sustainable Programming Initiative.

109
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:34.110 
We cannot provide all the solutions for any phase and for any expert that is necessary but we can work together and discover

110
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.549 
the potentials and unlock them together. For us,

111
00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:43.159 
it's very important to collaborate and participate.

112
00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:49.419 
We think of collaboration and participation in a way that some experts and teams are in charge of the knowledge management,

113
00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:54.299 
community exchange tools and infrastructure and in their face or domain.

114
00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:59.360 
And the Sustainable Programming Initiative is supervising, structuring, orchestrating, harmonizing

115
00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:05.659 
the several activities. A very good example for this is our artificial intelligence team at OSP.

116
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:15.750 
So, it's very clear that AI has a significant environmental impact and the AI team is aware of it and the AI team launched

117
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.879 
a Green AI project and this team has its own agenda and its own vision and strategy.

118
00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:23.169 
And we as a Sustainable Programming Initiative,

119
00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:31.860 
we support this project by defining, for example, from defining carbon calculation methodology, evaluating the methodology,

120
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:39.299 
providing dedicated tools and infrastructure together with them or even establish contacts with experts in the community and

121
00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:48.840 
make sure that the document or the outcomes are documented in a common knowledge database, that also all the people beyond

122
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:55.250 
this project have transparent access to this information and can incorporate it into their business, for example.

123
00:11:55.250 --> 00:12:04.409 
We see several similar opportunities and potentials in our demands, like in BI, logistics or e-commerce and

124
00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:12.080 
it's much easier to lift these potentials together when it sustainably is incorporated naturally as a non functional requirement

125
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.759 
in a similar way as we do with accessibility, security or scalability.

126
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:27.129 
So, it is very important for us to illustrate the significance of digital responsibility and motivate as many colleagues as

127
00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:35.169 
possible to participate and we believe a good way is to trigger, to see that you are not alone and many others have shared

128
00:12:35.169 --> 00:12:39.559 
the same goal and working together and to care about the environment.

129
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:47.580 
We're always looking for possibilities to raise the awareness and foster participation and by coincidence, just as we thought

130
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:55.779 
about how we can motivate and involve as much colleagues as possible, we became aware of an initiative by the Otto Group and

131
00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:57.559 
we asked if you want to join it.

132
00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:07.850 
So the story started in 2021, Baur (Baur Versand), another member of the Otto Group was inventing the digital spring clean event that was

133
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:14.750 
limited to Baur itself but the Otto Group got aware of it and the idea was born to apply this throughout the whole group.

134
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.820 
And it didn't take long and then 12 members as well as Otto Group holding

135
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:30.049 
were committed to this event. And now we have a common plan or we are planning a group by Digital spring clean event in 2020

136
00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:37.820 
that starts end of April with a period of two weeks and for us as Sustainable Programming Initiative, this is a really

137
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:43.350 
great thing because we believe it's a great opportunity to evoke the common spirit and the event

138
00:13:43.549 --> 00:13:46.149 
is made for the colleagues so everybody is invited.

139
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:53.149 
We share background information and we also provide several formats of participation as kick of events, checklists, tutorials

140
00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:54.559 
or participation calls.

141
00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:03.240 
The main objective is raise awareness of data minimalism among many employees as possible as well as counter the exponential

142
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.649 
growth of our data in our data storage.

143
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:16.179 
Yes some examples is we want together cleaning the storage in our systems, we use like SharePoint or Outlook, we

144
00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:23.210 
want to make aware of data transmissions that are unnecessary and can be avoided and how we can do it.

145
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:32.919 
We want to provide environmental friendly systems, settings for our systems and provide also these settings are automatically

146
00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:39.440 
by our IT and

147
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.899 
also promote longer device

148
00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:45.429 
usage time, for example, for our smartphones we use or for our laptops and desktop devices.

149
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:57.909 
Another thing we are currently supporting is shown here on this slide, this is a real life case study that our developers

150
00:14:57.909 --> 00:15:05.440 
became aware of and one of our logistics projects, please consider a system that

151
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.549 
needs to exchange shipment information between the producing and the consuming system and this data is shared

152
00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:17.019 
currently typically with JSON format, so a text format as you can see here on the right side.

153
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.759 
And the idea was born that this might be not the best option.

154
00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:28.320 
Maybe it could be improved to send a pdf file and an image about it.

155
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:40.090 
This has advantages and disadvantages but we, our colleagues and as sustainability is important for

156
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:40.419 
them.

157
00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:49.470 
They got a bad feeling about it, what environmental impact this could have and because of the additional data and in the

158
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:57.360 
end the solution got challenged and it has been found that it is hard for them to argue why it is a bad

159
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:09.629 
idea and to cover this feeling with some data and what impact this really has and here we assisted the team

160
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:17.620 
by the Sustainable Programming initiative to quantify and estimate the impact that really have. The impact that we have

161
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.289 
calculated here is only for the network emissions.

162
00:16:21.289 --> 00:16:32.049 
So no calculation emission is considered here but as you can see if you send the data in

163
00:16:32.049 --> 00:16:39.750 
scenario one with just the normal adjacent as you can see it, it will cause about 0.9 kg C02 equivalents per year.

164
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.559 
If you minify it, which is an easy task, it should be a standard.

165
00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:49.509 
You can lower it to 75% i.e. 2.7 kilogram per year.

166
00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:56.070 
But if you used the image, the data size increases drastically by 200 times.

167
00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:06.710 
And you see that this results in the end in 184 kg per year. That seems okay for now but if you consider it

168
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:15.960 
to have a lot of such decisions, it might be a system that is not as expected in the end regarding sustainability requirements.

169
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:21.529 
And here we want to show that an initial calculation is not difficult.

170
00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:29.779 
We can assist here and we can provide tools for doing it and you can use this data then to discuss it and

171
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:35.559 
to decide if strategy or an approach is worth it from a sustainable point of view or not.

172
00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:45.160 
Yeah, measuring energy usage and carbon emissions is also a key enabler for us at OSP.

173
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:52.259 
So for our cloud activities we are currently measuring our cost or kilowatt hours and our carbon dioxide equivalents.

174
00:17:52.839 --> 00:18:02.230 
It was initially planned to build a dedicated system in-house to measure our cloud carbon emissions as a result of

175
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.880 
our sustainable programming challenge.

176
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:11.230 
But after some research, it was found that there's already a free open source software on the market which exactly provided

177
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.769 
the functionality we intended in the first place.

178
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:21.359 
This tool is called "Cloud Carbon Footprint" and is maintained by Thought Works and we decided to give it a try and after

179
00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:23.859 
an evaluation phase we decided to use it.

180
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.960 
It is suitable for AWS, GCP and Azure.

181
00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:38.980 
It's not all the cloud service providers we are using but it covers a lot and it is always also currently further developed

182
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:46.140 
to cover on premise and workstations. And we want to incorporate this in the future as well.

183
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.529 
It provides a consistent methodology throughout all the systems.

184
00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:58.500 
It's initial set up is very easy and can be tested even locally without any infrastructure to set up.

185
00:18:58.509 --> 00:19:04.460 
But once you have it set up in your infrastructure and you have its base configured, it's very easy to onboard any project

186
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:10.960 
since you don't need to get involved with the project itself and change something in the project, but you can directly integrate

187
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:20.480 
the project into the tool and provides the outcome to the colleagues to work with and we have a lot of future

188
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.490 
activities on this to cover other cloud service providers like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure,

189
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:34.789 
OCI, as we have a lot of projects in this, we want to check the accuracy over time.

190
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:42.829 
We want to allow the teams and the business units to compare data between different approach and provide different aggregations

191
00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:51.900 
levels and therefore the system is also well suited to integrate into a bigger OSP sustainability platform.

192
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.670 
We dream of and we get the data out here and combine it with other data.

193
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:04.680 
Furthermore, it is important for us to give some guidance to the project members, to the teams, to the developers.

194
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:10.839 
So we want to provide background information and guide the user to become more energy efficient within the project

195
00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:16.339 
systems and services and

196
00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:20.980 
sorry, we want to provide guidelines, best practices for it to work in the cloud.

197
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:27.920 
For example why it is, in most cases, more energy efficient to run in the cloud, a system in

198
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.170 
the cloud in general or how could the cloud operation even be improved?

199
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:44.859 
We want to give some right sizing instructions or guidelines and we also want to make sure that the colleagues are

200
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:52.819 
knowing about the impact if they decide to go for a specific region that this has another impact when they decide for

201
00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:54.410 
another region, as you can see here.

202
00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:00.549 
Each region has its own power usage, efficiency value.

203
00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:08.549 
So it might be worth looking in which region to use and also to work differently in this region or

204
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:09.680 
in the cloud service provider.

205
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:17.700 
As you can use the CPU and GPU, FPGA or TPU whatever the task requires and you can also run scheduled

206
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:26.460 
tasks when the carbon emission is considered to be lower or better over that.

207
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:40.460 
We also think that recommendation is a very important thing to lower the energy consumption and CO2 emissions and also

208
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.559 
lift the potential of cost from the cloud usage.

209
00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:53.960 
And here you can see just one example of rightsizing recommendations we have it for AWS and for GCP and for

210
00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:55.059 
AWS

211
00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:59.390 
it's, for example, the working with the regard of Amazon ECS

212
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:07.890 
instances where you can terminate or remove, shut down idle instances or downsized instances from a micro instance to a

213
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.779 
nano instance and you get the information you don't need

214
00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:12.950 
your instance type.

215
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.460 
Please use another instance type.

216
00:22:14.839 --> 00:22:24.650 
And for GCP can also use recommendations like stopping VM if it is an identified that it's an idle VM or changed

217
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.140 
machine type as well,

218
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:34.759 
delete snapshot or disk or the leaked images and this is what we want to further support and provide more information

219
00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:35.170 
on this.

220
00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:37.250 
Yeah.

221
00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:46.049 
With respect to the time, simply said our main activity and next steps is all about applying the strategy and the instruments

222
00:22:46.049 --> 00:22:55.549 
to OSP, we really care about to promote, to work together to establish sustainability as an integral part of the company.

223
00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.130 
And the question might be in the end, what's now the corporate paradigm?

224
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.559 
In the end we want to promote,

225
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:11.359 
it might be the strategy or the instrument or the tools we apply, but actually we think each company has an oversetting,

226
00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:17.559 
different environment and circumstances and therefore it's very hard to find a common template for a strategy.

227
00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:26.000 
On the other hand, we believe that people and almost everybody is interested to live in a healthy and flourishing

228
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.140 
environment and we as a Sustainable Programming Initiative, we see on the paradigm primarily as a cultural mindset asset

229
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.410 
shared within the company.

230
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:41.259 
And we would really love to see that similar culture also arises in many other companies and become a corporate paradigm

231
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:46.819 
in the future and we are happy to be here to share authority and maybe also inspiring of us to come step closer to bring

232
00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:47.630 
this to reality.

233
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.450 
Thank you very much.

234
00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:59.859 
Thank you very much for your presentation and all the different insights into the Sustainable Programming Initiative.

235
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.349 
I think, yeah, we can just straight get over to the QnA session.

236
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:11.490 
Yeah, just as a quick reminder, if you don't want to be recognized in the, in the recording afterwards, then you can just

237
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.450 
type your question in the chat.

238
00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:17.549 
But if you want to discuss in person then it's always nice if you can just raise your hand and then we can

239
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:25.190 
pick you so we can all discuss in person and I think well there might be some person still thinking or maybe typing.

240
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:33.529 
I have prepared few first questions. I really think this cloud carbon tool looked very very interesting and I was

241
00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:41.019 
quite surprised that it really covers so much of your, of the entire Otto Group solution of all the services.

242
00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:49.180 
So my first question would be did you already gain some insights from analyzing with this tool or did you get any interesting

243
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:57.269 
like intuitions what actions in the real world have any effect on the CO2 balance or on the cost

244
00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:58.359 
and so on?

245
00:25:00.089 --> 00:25:09.430 
So, we just launched or we set up the tool beginning of the year and we now ended

246
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:16.420 
the evaluation for us to see if the system is suitable of our needs and we have found that this system is good but we

247
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:24.039 
are using just on a subset of our systems and we are just using it for some systems that are considered small in the beginning

248
00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:30.829 
so it's kind of a self monitoring of the system itself and even the recommendations is currently not set up for for all the

249
00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:31.460 
projects.

250
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:40.059 
So, so far it's difficult to say what we can really use for it, but we consider the system as the first trigger and

251
00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:47.849 
access point for all the colleagues that they can see what it really means, what carbon emissions their system

252
00:25:47.849 --> 00:25:55.200 
provides and from this together with the guidelines we want to provide and with the actions they can see over time how

253
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.829 
it changed.

254
00:25:55.839 --> 00:26:05.839 
And we also want to apply more logic on top of it and to see when they change some dedicated information, computational

255
00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:07.079 
algorithm or something like that

256
00:26:07.089 --> 00:26:09.660 
what impact this directly has.

257
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:18.029 
This is not something that the tool currently covers, but this is what we want to integrate in OSP sustainability platform

258
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:25.049 
to bring more data together, bring the requirements of the team together with this tool and then evolve.

259
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:32.470 
That's the current scenario, so for now there's not too much insight but if you like, we could share it and

260
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.349 
once we have more experience with it.

261
00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:42.490 
Sure, yeah, maybe that would be a chance so we can just get back in a few months and then ask you again, maybe

262
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.359 
what you have learned from the tool already then.

263
00:26:44.839 --> 00:26:51.869 
And you just mentioned again as also in the presentation and the guidelines and tools that you're using to support the

264
00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:56.859 
supporters at the different companies or subsidiaries at the Otto Group solution provider.

265
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:05.069 
And so my question would be, we've already talked a lot about concrete tools and guidelines and examples of what developers

266
00:27:05.069 --> 00:27:12.130 
can do in their everyday work life really at work while they're developing something and writing code and how they can write

267
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.660 
more efficient or at least more energy efficient code in particular?

268
00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:22.539 
And so my next question would be, do you have some concrete examples which you provide to your developers and maybe that

269
00:27:22.539 --> 00:27:25.849 
are also accessible to the public or are you also still working on that?

270
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.420 
Yes, we are, we are working on that.

271
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:34.130 
It's not the case that we have a huge asset of all the infrastructure.

272
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:41.150 
So we currently have provided as a Sustainable Programming Initiative task, a template and various examples to do so.

273
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:50.789 
And it's for example, for database for AI, for in general programming which while for the cloud especially we have

274
00:27:50.799 --> 00:28:00.460 
several examples and currently we gathered it together and shared in our confluence system and we want to incorporate

275
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.670 
the colleagues and the experts.

276
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:09.950 
So we as a Sustainable Programming Initiative, we are not able to gather all together and to bring it to the paper in

277
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:19.529 
the end, what we want to do is we want to have it participatively collected so we provide everything that is necessary.

278
00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:26.349 
Get in contact and, once we find from our database experts, for example, good things.

279
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:32.299 
We will bring back to make it visible and once we have evolved and we have a huge catalog then we want to share this

280
00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:32.900 
with the world.

281
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:39.349 
But currently this is also something that is evolving and we have found that it's really hard currently on the market to

282
00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:40.480 
find a lot of things.

283
00:28:40.539 --> 00:28:47.630 
So you have a lot of resources and we gathered all these resources together and we want to have a peer review on this resource

284
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.259 
resources and then develop such a system and also bring it back to the OSP

285
00:28:53.259 --> 00:29:00.480 
sustainability platform where you can, for example, have your technology rather that we also developing at OSP.

286
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:07.140 
And with the technology rather and the text of these tools, you can see what it's worth looking on it and then you can combine

287
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:13.759 
it, you can see the carbon emissions data and then you have a comprehensive view on it and you get triggered.

288
00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:22.339 
So you get to the action what you can start and you get all the knowledge in your mind you need to consider to

289
00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:24.059 
incorporate it into your daily work.

290
00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:25.269 
That's the idea.

291
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.589 
Yeah, I think that fits very much to what we talked about four weeks ago.

292
00:29:30.589 --> 00:29:37.180 
So we had Professor Benno Schmidt here in the openXchange live talk and he also said that he started a project where he

293
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.289 
tries to find sustainable programming patterns.

294
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:45.970 
So I think many of us know some kind of programming patterns that he tried to use to have better maintainable code

295
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:46.839 
and software and so on.

296
00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:50.559 
And he tries to focus specifically on sustainable development patterns.

297
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.420 
And I think that fits very, very well to that.

298
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.859 
Maybe in a few months time we can get back to that and maybe share some of the results.

299
00:29:57.859 --> 00:29:59.950 
I would be, I'm very much looking forward to that.

300
00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:08.769 
Okay, so I don't see anyone raising their hand right now, I want to give any everyone the chance, of course, but I

301
00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:11.670 
don't see anything in the chat either, so I see, Johannes.

302
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.210 
Go ahead! Hi Johannes

303
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:24.369 
Rudolph here! I am working at meshcloud and we're doing cloud foundation platforms for customers a lot.

304
00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:31.839 
So I really liked the approach that you took with cloud carbon footprint by extrapolating essentially the cloud builds

305
00:30:31.839 --> 00:30:39.519 
and using that data source to give teams that individual responsibility, which fits really well with the model

306
00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:44.670 
of using the cloud in the first place, which empowers teams to make their own infrastructure decisions.

307
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.069 
I have two questions.

308
00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:57.589 
The first one goes a bit into the kind of you mentioned this as kind of like an initiative going on in Otto Group

309
00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:01.019 
to establish more sustainability into IT.

310
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:10.890 
However, it sounded very not much formal in the way that I recently became aware that there is this European Union corporate

311
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:19.119 
sustainability reporting directive being discussed to be enforced actually next year already which would be a public regulation

312
00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:22.390 
requiring most public listed companies.

313
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:31.119 
And I suppose Otto is large enough to be somehow in that area to actively formally report their IT

314
00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:38.559 
carbon footprint. Is any of that part of your motivation or do you have that on your radar so far?

315
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:46.509 
Actually this is not part of the motivation of our Sustainable Programming Initiative because you need to decide we are

316
00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:53.400 
part of the Otto Group but we are also driving our own business.

317
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:59.109 
So Otto is quite a huge company with 50,000 people involved but we as OSP,

318
00:31:59.109 --> 00:32:08.589 
we are let's say, 450 people currently, and therefore we are not forced to do this as far as I know and our motivation is

319
00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:16.029 
also we don't want to suit the regulation or we don't want to wait until the regulation hits us and we need to do something,

320
00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:17.640 
we want to be ahead of it.

321
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:26.869 
So we just do it by convincement and when the regulation comes we feel well prepared and what we currently do is from

322
00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:31.200 
our perspective and we want to share it back to the Otto Group itself.

323
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.809 
The Otto Group with all its business is very different.

324
00:32:33.819 --> 00:32:40.359 
It's a lot of digital systems but we are kind of the IT

325
00:32:40.369 --> 00:32:46.779 
service provider and you have, for example, Hermes with the logistics, you have AoS with financial aspects.

326
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:55.660 
So it's it's not commonly shared what we are doing currently but at least digital responsibility is important and they currently

327
00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:00.759 
also figure out how they can measure their carbon footprint in the cloud, for example.

328
00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.589 
And what we want to do is we want to give this back.

329
00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:13.690 
We have recently some requests for presentation of this tool and of our approach and the good thing is since we are

330
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:25.279 
in our as you mentioned it's calculated by the billing accounts and our projects' billing

331
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:33.640 
account lies at the Otto Group and we are using the Otto Group building accounts data and dump it into our own database and

332
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.799 
from this database, everything gets calculated.

333
00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:42.930 
So with this tool it's very easy to just incorporate all the other projects inside the Otto Group as we just need to get

334
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:50.920 
the data and then it's available and that's one of the big advantage for us that you don't need to ask a project for

335
00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.589 
permission or something.

336
00:33:52.589 --> 00:33:59.440 
You just can say if you want to show your data we can do so we just need to gather the data from

337
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.460 
the billing account and everything is fine.

338
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.759 
Yeah, very cool!

339
00:34:04.769 --> 00:34:13.659 
Yeah, my second question would go into the kind of same direction but you already answered that essentially

340
00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.719 
the public regulation that might be coming.

341
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:22.969 
It's not like it's not necessary for you to take action already, which is really cool.

342
00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:31.800 
One thing however, that I find quite interesting, I just wanted to know if you looked into it, you highlighted

343
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:38.099 
the point that the carbon footprint reporting tool that you're using, that it uses like a consistent methodology right across

344
00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:40.739 
all the cloud providers by importing the billing data.

345
00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:47.039 
And I think they have some energy grid composition data for the regions that they use and then some metrics where they

346
00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:55.099 
multiply it by the service, you know, the tools, the things that they sold essentially - the cloud resources that multiply

347
00:34:55.099 --> 00:34:57.900 
that to get the carbon footprint.

348
00:34:57.909 --> 00:35:05.860 
And one of the things that I'm aware of, what the regulation is trying to do that's coming is this division

349
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:14.710 
into like score 1-2-3 emissions where essentially what you're describing the cloud, the cloud emissions essentially would

350
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:22.039 
be scope 3 emissions because it's stuff that you buy through the value chain, essentially it's your supply chain buying

351
00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:31.510 
things from the cloud provider, and Google cloud for example, has started calculating data similar to that like themselves

352
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:39.179 
based on their own data sources, which is apparently a bit more fine granular and and probably even more accurate because

353
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:46.530 
they kind of guarantee that the data aggregates consistently.

354
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:53.349 
So if you take the whole European West 3 footprint and Frankfurt, for example, that the carbon footprint they measure is

355
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:58.659 
exactly what goes into the data center essentially and they divide that among all the customs.

356
00:35:59.139 --> 00:36:10.960 
Have you looked into this similar things, like a more accurate version or what is your current

357
00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:16.460 
stand on, like you know what data sources to use for this kind of reporting, really?

358
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.150 
Yeah!

359
00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:29.630 
So in last year's Next '21 conference by Google, they introduced this CO2 footprint tool that they have in their cloud

360
00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:37.510 
and also AWS was launching such a tool just some weeks ago. When we started to think about it,

361
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:46.760 
these tools were not available and therefore we started with this tool and yes, we are aware of

362
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:54.250 
this, we compare this data, we see how this data is working and we have found that there are some differences.

363
00:36:55.130 --> 00:37:03.170 
Currently, we don't know exactly why this is caused or how this is caused but we try to figure it out.

364
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:10.110 
On the other hand, you have with this tool we use different approaches, you have this approach where you get the

365
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:19.849 
billing data and you can calculate the energy consumption out of the data and then you can calculate the carbon

366
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:30.360 
dioxide emissions but you can also use a more accurate version where you are using the cloud monitoring time series values

367
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.900 
for the CPUs' usage for the instances and it is calculated by that values.

368
00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:41.710 
This is kind of limited, this is not an approach that is working for all the services.

369
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:47.880 
The benefit currently is that the billing account approach is working for all the services so no matter which service you

370
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.230 
are consuming, it gets calculated out of it.

371
00:37:51.230 --> 00:38:02.960 
And we are thinking about that, we might have kind of a hybrid solution where if a team is needing more insight on

372
00:38:02.969 --> 00:38:11.039 
the real CPU usage, for example, then we try to implement it since it's a free open source tool, you can customize it,

373
00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:19.869 
so these are the opportunities but we don't want to push it in any direction.

374
00:38:19.869 --> 00:38:27.659 
We think it might be the best direction, we want to get in touch with the project and see what their needs are and

375
00:38:27.659 --> 00:38:34.650 
if the need is clear that they want to have this data then we will do so and we also think about, as

376
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:42.590 
I mentioned earlier to integrate the cloud infrastructure and if you really decide to do it we will also bring

377
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:49.539 
this back to the community that this is another cloud service provider that can be measured with this system.

378
00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:51.869 
Yeah, very cool!

379
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.760 
Thanks, thanks a lot.

380
00:38:52.769 --> 00:38:54.210 
Thanks a lot for that insight.

381
00:38:54.219 --> 00:39:01.530 
It's always cool to see also that, you know, you're not getting held up too much in the debate of like is this model

382
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:10.969 
more accurate or is it like really like is every gram of CO2 probably accounted for right, it's getting started is probably

383
00:39:10.969 --> 00:39:18.239 
the most important aspect but just out of curiosity like how big did you find are the differences between what

384
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.969 
Google self reports for example, versus what you are calculating?

385
00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:30.329 
Is it like just a couple of percent in there or is it like..? We have done it with some of

386
00:39:30.329 --> 00:39:36.880 
our example projects but this example projects are not our biggest project, so it's as you might have seen on the

387
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:46.530 
slides or the tool, I have shown it's about yeah, less than a ton that we, the system that we used currently

388
00:39:46.539 --> 00:39:59.190 
and here we have found that the difference is, is big, so it's kind of 20% and the cloud carbon footprint tool

389
00:39:59.199 --> 00:40:06.869 
is underestimating the current emissions and what we want to do is we want to figure out and why this happens.

390
00:40:06.869 --> 00:40:13.469 
So there are a lot of parameters underlying and we are in contact with Thought Works also for the on-premise calculation

391
00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:18.320 
we want to figure out and then we can fine tune in the parameters to make it more accurate.

392
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.829 
So we are not limited to the current results.

393
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:28.059 
We can evolve and we can align to the Google calculation and that's what we want to do in the future

394
00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:28.440 
as well.

395
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.059 
Very cool!

396
00:40:31.059 --> 00:40:31.739 
Thank you.

397
00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:35.639 
Thank you very much for the questions.

398
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:43.239 
Okay, so in the meantime there's been another question from the chat and from someone who is currently doing his Master's

399
00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:45.360 
thesis in the field of sustainable software development.

400
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.300 
So that just fits right here.

401
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:53.380 
And the question is, are you also looking into other sustainability aspects apart from energy consumption, like of course

402
00:40:53.380 --> 00:41:00.050 
hardware requirements and the resources needed for this hardware or like the process of producing the software itself before

403
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:05.320 
which includes of course buildings, transportation and everything around that?

404
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:08.050 
Just for working at a company and so on.

405
00:41:08.059 --> 00:41:13.710 
Do you think that has a big enough impact to account for that or is it too hard to measure?

406
00:41:15.909 --> 00:41:23.760 
We definitely think that this has an impact and we want to measure it and incorporate it but we're just not so far to

407
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.099 
have it.

408
00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:30.989 
So for example, what I mentioned and we want to have our on-premise systems and workstations or laptops also covered.

409
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:39.130 
And we also have the Otto Group for example, that is setting up a dashboard where you can have your personal CO2

410
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:45.130 
dashboard where you see when you are working for the company, you see what your CO2 emissions are?

411
00:41:45.139 --> 00:41:53.590 
So if you store your data, you have 10 gigabytes of mails, for example, and you have your travel expenses, you're traveling

412
00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:56.739 
every week to New York or something like that.

413
00:41:56.909 --> 00:42:02.239 
This will all gather together and provided by the Otto Group as a common infrastructure to all the persons.

414
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:06.789 
And we want to evolve to get carbon aware throughout the whole process.

415
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.750 
So we don't want to to measure what we are operating in the cloud.

416
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:17.710 
We want to also apply it to the whole software development life cycle as I have showed on the slide.

417
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:23.570 
So when we have the requirement engineering phase and we are together with the customers and getting the requirements we

418
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:29.880 
want to discuss - is one solution really the best choice for sustainability?

419
00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:35.750 
We want to also incorporate maybe our HR coaches as we have in the Sustainable Program Initiative.

420
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.650 
Also our coaches to bring this to the whole software development process.

421
00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:42.599 
So we don't want to be limited.

422
00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:50.380 
Currently we are kind of limited but this is the integral part we were talking about, we want to drive it as far

423
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.440 
as possible and also that's more a company level.

424
00:42:53.449 --> 00:43:03.869 
Our CO2, for our facilities is quite high and we can do a lot of that and our hardware if

425
00:43:03.869 --> 00:43:11.599 
we buy hardware from a dedicated vendor, we could know what this means and this is also accounted in our CO2 footprint

426
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:20.309 
and we can check is there any hardware that is similar regarding the performance for example, but has a much lesser impact

427
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:21.719 
on the embodied emissions.

428
00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:26.159 
And so we are not dealing too much with hardware actually.

429
00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:28.360 
So we don't buy a lot of hardware.

430
00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:33.159 
We are dedicated to the cloud and we use hardware for personal work.

431
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.519 
and we want to cover it, but this needs to be evolved.

432
00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:39.860 
Okay, thanks a lot!

433
00:43:39.869 --> 00:43:41.929 
I hope that answers the question.

434
00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:44.889 
If not, you can of course type something in the chat again.

435
00:43:44.889 --> 00:43:45.550 
Ah! I see!

436
00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:46.389 
That's interesting!

437
00:43:46.389 --> 00:43:47.469 
Thank you very much.

438
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:53.789 
Yeah, I think also maybe to add to this, the clean-IT initiative was also found specifically to kind of focus

439
00:43:53.789 --> 00:44:00.340 
on the software part because we thought that there are already quite a lot of ideas and solutions which only focus on the

440
00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.929 
hardware requirements or mostly focused on the hardware.

441
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:10.280 
And so there's a lot of certificates out there which tell you whether the PC or the printer or anything

442
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.719 
else you buy is environmentally friendly enough or energy efficient.

443
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:20.719 
And so, part that needs more development is the software part, but it's of course important as well.

444
00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:29.719 
Okay, so my last question would go to the Digital Spring Clean Initiative, which you talked a little bit about and

445
00:44:29.719 --> 00:44:37.050 
I think that sounded really interesting because it sounded like something that is really incorporated into the or which is

446
00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:42.449 
a constant part of the corporate work at OSP.

447
00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:48.849 
So my question would be is it really planned to do this every year from now or was it just a one time event?

448
00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:56.869 
And also does the initiative focus rather on the personal storage files for example and the personal cleaning for each of

449
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.489 
the employees?

450
00:44:57.489 --> 00:45:05.719 
Or is it really a system wide or a systematic cleaning type for all the applications that are produced and developed?

451
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.110 
Yeah, that would be interesting to know, I think.

452
00:45:09.929 --> 00:45:11.750 
Okay that we have several questions.

453
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:17.380 
So let me start with if it is annually or not.

454
00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:26.960 
So Baur did it in 2020 and they were successful on it and a lot of people were interested in it and the

455
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.610 
Otto Group is now driving it the first year for

456
00:45:32.269 --> 00:45:34.780 
12 Otto Group members.

457
00:45:34.889 --> 00:45:44.090 
And we expect that this really happens every year but

458
00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:52.329 
the goal is not that we want to have everybody lazy and once a year for a period of two weeks and several events

459
00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:53.309 
and they got away.

460
00:45:53.309 --> 00:46:05.960 
Oh we have to clean up something, we want to establish kind of a thinking by the colleagues like when you're working

461
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.980 
and you're storing your data, you think before you store your data somewhere - is it the right place, is it the right thing

462
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.150 
to store, is it something that needs to be stored?

463
00:46:14.159 --> 00:46:19.030 
Is it something that only takes two weeks and afterwards?

464
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.500 
Nobody is interested in it.

465
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:25.480 
And so,

466
00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:34.449 
yes, we want to make it, not a snapshot in time, we want to make this continuous process that you

467
00:46:34.449 --> 00:46:40.690 
are always aware of when you have data, when you transfer data this has an impact and try to reduce it as much as

468
00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:45.920 
possible and if this is incorporated in your daily work, if you're writing emails and you're putting all your attachments

469
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.820 
to it and you're sending 60 MB of emails every time,

470
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.409 
that might be really bad.

471
00:46:50.679 --> 00:46:58.610 
But it's not difficult to just send the links to SharePoint, for example, inside the email and then it costs

472
00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:05.820 
almost nothing and if you are aware of this and you just use these little things and then you can do it much.

473
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:15.260 
But what we want to do in the end is we want to measure the success, so each member participating has its own definition

474
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:21.949 
of how we can measure the success and in the end we want to see how much data is really safe or is cleaned

475
00:47:21.949 --> 00:47:28.690 
up and for us it means yeah, we're cleaning up our Outlook for example, we are cleaning up also our Confluence system, we're

476
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:34.429 
cleaning our JIRA system, we're cleaning our SharePoint, we're cleaning our Microsoft Teams, we have a lot of tools and all these

477
00:47:34.429 --> 00:47:40.329 
tool or a lot of tools or spam with a lot of data and we want to be aware of it.

478
00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:46.130 
And mostly it's not you have your personal data like it's my file, you have shared files

479
00:47:46.139 --> 00:47:52.530 
that belongs to a lot of people too, a whole team or a whole project and what we want to achieve is, for

480
00:47:52.530 --> 00:48:01.170 
example, that if a team is interested in it, we give support and then we can come together and we can give guidelines

481
00:48:01.179 --> 00:48:02.809 
on how to clean it.

482
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:04.070 
If it is okay to clean it.

483
00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:08.769 
If this is data, maybe you need to save for a longer time or not.

484
00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.429 
This is somehow the approach.

485
00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.500 
I hope it answers the question. Did I miss a question? No! Thank you.

486
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.630 
I think there was everything that I wanted to know.

487
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:22.110 
I also was going to ask an additional question whether you're trying to measure that the success or whether you're trying to do something

488
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:22.489 
with it.

489
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.280 
But you already answered that I think and I'm also really looking forward to the resource.

490
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:33.489 
So maybe we can get back to you after the Digital Spring Cleaning this year and then maybe also share the results

491
00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:36.900 
and all the insights that you gained from that, I think that would be really interesting.

492
00:48:37.369 --> 00:48:45.010 
So one more question has come in the chat and Katja says, "I think the collaboration idea is great"

493
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:52.000 
and I think she's probably pointing at the collaboration between all those different Otto Group companies and the subsidiaries

494
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:59.460 
But how do you ensure that in the collaborations no sensitive data information is exchanged and what are in regards to that

495
00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:01.280 
the limits to the collaboration?

496
00:49:04.969 --> 00:49:14.530 
Yeah, so inside the Otto Group, I would say it's a lot of collaboration so there's a lot of data

497
00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:25.809 
shared and if we share some sensitive data it's, I don't know, what kind of sensitive data I could

498
00:49:25.809 --> 00:49:26.389 
think of.

499
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.320 
It's definitely kind of personal data for our customers.

500
00:49:30.329 --> 00:49:32.139 
So this data is covered.

501
00:49:32.139 --> 00:49:37.389 
We don't bring personal data for any of our customers into any system.

502
00:49:37.769 --> 00:49:45.599 
So this would not happen but all the other data like the CO2 emissions, that's nothing that we need to hide

503
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.670 
inside the company and maybe it's nothing we need to hide outside the company.

504
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:58.480 
So I would say, yeah, we need to be aware that no personal data is shared and, for example, dashboard, I

505
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.139 
mentioned, this is one thing.

506
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:08.510 
So we don't want to share how much the carbon footprint of a dedicated person in the company is and everybody can look on

507
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:15.309 
it and see, "Eh! you are really bad, you need to do something!" that is nothing that should happen and that will

508
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:16.090 
not happen.

509
00:50:16.099 --> 00:50:24.460 
But we want to have it more aggregated than on a team level, for example, or on a project level in order to

510
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.690 
allow the people to work on it together.

511
00:50:31.059 --> 00:50:32.219 
Okay, thank you.

512
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.889 
I hope that answers the question.

513
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.469 
If not you can of course come back to us, but I think that was it.

514
00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:43.280 
And the last comment from the chat has been someone shared the Green SCOR model.

515
00:50:43.289 --> 00:50:51.670 
Again, I think we've already collected this link at some part and yeah, I think when nobody else wants to ask any

516
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:53.690 
questions, we can wrap this up right here.

517
00:50:54.159 --> 00:50:57.130 
And so for the end, let me just quickly share my screen again.

518
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.079 
And so, okay, I need to close that.

519
00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:06.750 
Okay, I hope yeah, you can see my screen now.

520
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:13.510 
So the next things I just want to quickly announce, we of course will have another live talk in about four weeks again on

521
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:21.670 
Monday and this time we will invite Jonathan Donges who is working at the Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung,

522
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:30.250 
so for climate research in general and he's going to talk a little bit about how they are using AI for sustainable research

523
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:38.719 
so not that much about making AI more sustainable itself, but how they incorporate AI into their research at the pick.

524
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:44.269 
Two other things we have to announce this time, or we are proud to announce today,

525
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.280 
the clean-IT community conference will take place in just two days at the HPI

526
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:55.380 
here in Potsdam in person and we have a lot of speakers and if you are already enrolled in the clean-IT forum, you've

527
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.780 
probably already heard about it.

528
00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:59.110 
If not, you can of course still enroll there.

529
00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:05.949 
And at the same day, we will also release our new sustainable programming MOOC where we'll dive a little bit deeper into

530
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:11.679 
the concrete programming examples to make programming in general more sustainable.

531
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:18.260 
And with that being said, of course, if you haven't already, please feel free to join the clean-IT Forum on openHPI

532
00:52:18.269 --> 00:52:20.389 
or contact us directly via mail.

533
00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:24.550 
And so I want to thank you all again for your time.

534
00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:29.659 
Thank you Tobias for your time, thank you for your questions and your answers and respectively.

535
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:36.099 
And for a very interesting presentation again, we will of course provide the presentation also in the clean-IT Forum and

536
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:42.780 
I hope that we can see all of you in four weeks again or maybe even on Wednesday on the clean-IT community conference.

537
00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.579 
Thank you and goodbye.

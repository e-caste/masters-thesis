WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.259 
And this European level is the one that we are going to next,

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.130 
and Dr. Meister has mentioned in his speech

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.859 
the digital education action plan that

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.060 
the European Commission issued last year.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960 
And we are very happy to welcome Dr. Gheorghiu

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.489 
Dimitrov today.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.432 
He actually lead the development of this digital

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.140 
education action plan.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.904 
And he is the acting head of the newly created

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.860 
digital education unit at the European Commission.

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.070 
He has been with the commission since 2008.

12
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.249 
And before that, he worked for a leading multinational telecommunications

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.229 
company in Germany, as well as a software startup, so he can share

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.439 
his thoughts on digital education from a European perspective.

15
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.468 
So the floor is yours, welcome.

16
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.319 
Thank you very much, Christiane.

17
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.269 
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, first of all, let

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.721 
me thank you for the invitation to this

19
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.109 
conference, which I am very very pleased to contribute to.

20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.578 
And in fact, it is a privilege for me to be here because it is now the second time

21
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.769 
that I have the honor to be here, which brings a lot

22
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.850 
of joy, but also even more responsibility.

23
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.261 
So I will contribute with my presentation towards

24
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.889 
the very important discussion that was just opened by Professor Meinel and also by the

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.440 
state secretary from a European perspective.

26
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.904 
Before I do that, I will put some slides on so

27
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.620 
that they can just help me a little bit in this process.

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.969 
So I hope that you will be able to see

29
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.970 
them right now.

30
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.138 
Let me say that this event is a real touchpoint

31
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.340 
for everybody who is working on the field of eMOOCS

32
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.499 
obviously, but certainly more and more broadly,

33
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.520 
also in digital education. And personally, I can

34
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.453 
attest to the great learnings that I have drawn

35
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.879 
from being part of it.

36
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.240 
So personally, it is also a great pleasure to be here.

37
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.909 
And I also look very much forward to exchanging together with you.

38
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.539 
I will provide a reflection on the past, present

39
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.729 
and the future of digital education at EU level, and I will make some

40
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.800 
remarks on digital education content in particular.

41
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.869 
And let me start by just reflecting, last time when

42
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.010 
I attended the conference, it was 2019

43
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.339 
in the sunny city of Napoli.

44
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.559 
And one has to say that quite some things have happened

45
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.750 
since these days, which were just two years ago.

46
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.439 
And back then, the commission was implementing the first digital education action

47
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.060 
plan, which I was also responsible for.

48
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.720 
And this work was something that came after what I would describe

49
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.389 
purely illustratively as long winter coming after the

50
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.259 
MOOC hype earlier in the day.

51
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.149 
So when I received your kind invitation a few months ago, I thought maybe

52
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.219 
it is time to reflect a little bit on what has happened so far.

53
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.449 
Where are we at? And perhaps what's next, when it comes to

54
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.789 
the work of the European Commission in the field of digital education.

55
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.720 
And when we do this, we always have to

56
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.656 
make sure that we understand the basics of how we work

57
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.060 
in this field and for probably everyone,

58
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.229 
this is quite clear. But nevertheless, I would like to make it obvious that

59
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.444 
it is the member states who are responsible for education and training in the European

60
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.199 
Union and even in the host country in the

61
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.430 
Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.

62
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.180 
It is actually the lander that are responsible for it.

63
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.250 
And what the European Union is doing is it supports

64
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.782 
the education and training systems of the member states, but it does

65
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.539 
not have any competences to, let's say, intervene

66
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.259 
in them.

67
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.935 
This is quite important when it comes to expectations, but also in terms of

68
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.779 
responsibility. Now, I would hope that you will probably agree with me

69
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.420 
that in today's world, local, regional,

70
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.766 
national, global are not the best objectives

71
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.059 
when it comes to describing the nature of education and in

72
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.829 
particular of digital education, which is, of course, why the European Union

73
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.070 
is already working on this field for quite some time now.

74
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.919 
So let's start by looking a little bit at the past and recalling

75
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.693 
some of the work that we have been doing so far and what we have learned from

76
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.010 
it. One could say that it has started with

77
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.230 
the so-called Lisbon Agenda in the

78
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.300 
early 2000s when the European Union member states

79
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.699 
set themselves the objective to become the most competitive

80
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.979 
knowledge economy.

81
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.379 
Back in the day, this was perceived as the other

82
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.079 
sort of competitor being the United States.

83
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.630 
And the information age was coming with a vengeance.

84
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.269 
Everything had an 'e' in front of the word e-health,

85
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.300 
e-government and of course, e-learning.

86
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.499 
So the European Commission back then proposed the e-learning program exactly

87
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.639 
20 years ago, and the focus was on

88
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.009 
providing for infrastructure, personal computers in the classroom,

89
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.033 
some multimedia devices, looking at how some of

90
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.850 
the curriculum might be adopted.

91
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.538 
And in parallel, we have always had a very

92
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.779 
strong focus at the European level on the digital skills and competences issue.

93
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.989 
This was framed very much as the enabler to be the

94
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.939 
most competitive knowledge economy that I spoke of, to develop

95
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.140 
the type of engineers that we would need to compete.

96
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.509 
And we have had a number of initiatives.

97
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.279 
I have put forward just some of them without wanting to be exhaustive.

98
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.350 
These skills initiative or, for example, the digital competence framework.

99
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.928 
And perhaps delayed by the financial crisis, 2008 and -09.

100
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.320 
In 2013, we came back to revisit this subject, if you like,

101
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.389 
with the opening up education initiative, which put a lot of emphasis

102
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.009 
on open education resources, open learning environments

103
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.550 
and, of course, books.

104
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.100 
Professor Meinel mentioned 2012.

105
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.589 
2013 was the heyday.

106
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.799 
And so we also looked at that.

107
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.382 
What, of course, is obvious is that in the evolving field of digital

108
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.169 
education, there are many different initiatives that go on sometimes

109
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.660 
in parallel and not always in coordination to each other.

110
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.100 
And this is true for the European level.

111
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.039 
This is probably true for some national levels as well.

112
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.230 
And in 2018, we undertook a

113
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.709 
modest and humble attempt to look at the question of

114
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.140 
digital education policy in an integrated approach.

115
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.889 
We looked at the infrastructure, the skills and the data and research

116
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.320 
that are needed. I just listened to the intro

117
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.989 
speech of the state secretary and can only attest that

118
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.389 
the narrative there is very much in line with

119
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.360 
what we proposed back in 2018.

120
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.729 
And we have also put ourselves there in very, I would say,

121
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.300 
tight shoes.

122
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.629 
If I can put it like this. We envisaged only a very short duration.

123
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.729 
We envisaged the focus on the formal education sector and last but

124
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.200 
not least, we did not put any significant new resources onto it.

125
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.492 
Why? Because we wanted to experiment whether this approach

126
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.149 
is making sense in principle.

127
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.779 
Now, looking from today's point of view, one

128
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.460 
can say that both evidence, but also providence

129
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.449 
show that the challenges that we have had in the last 20 years, because

130
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.590 
it's exactly 20 years since the e-Learning program came about.

131
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.159 
Are not only there, but they are actually increasing.

132
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.680 
And if we look at the evidence perhaps and the key

133
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.289 
aspect of digital skills and competencies, which I would

134
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.999 
argue are basic type of competencies in the meantime, next to literacy

135
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.460 
and numeracy, we see that

136
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.739 
looking at the target of the European Union, which is to

137
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.019 
achieve by 2030, a share

138
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.519 
of the population with basic or above basic digital

139
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.559 
skills of at least 80 percent.

140
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.799 
And a twin target to reach at least 20 million advanced

141
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.692 
ICT specialists, that's the right box.

142
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.159 
And there is a couple of letters that are missing next to the 20.

143
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.650 
So these two targets are for 20, 30.

144
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.659 
And what you see here is the 2019 situation.

145
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.010 
Well, this share tells us that

146
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.869 
some countries are probably closer to achieving this type of targets,

147
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.367 
but many are very, very far away from this.

148
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.140 
And of course, all of this is just absolute numbers.

149
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.779 
So we don't know the growth rate then.

150
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.399 
It does not really matter that much.

151
00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.289 
So with the next slide, what I would like to show you is, in fact, the growth rate

152
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.419 
in increasing the type of digital skills that we need.

153
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.390 
So you see here in the two bars, the

154
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.029 
2015 green status and the 2019 status when it comes to the

155
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.867 
basic digital skills in Europe.

156
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.649 
What is clear is that the underlying growth rate,

157
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.210 
which we have observed over those four years, which by the way, is only

158
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.550 
2 per cent.

159
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.376 
Even if that would be doubled, we would not be able to reach the

160
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.580 
targets that we have set ourselves.

161
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.119 
And I don't have the same slide for the ICT specialists, but

162
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.360 
the situation is quite similar.

163
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.995 
We would need to substantially accelerate and

164
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.669 
change the way we approach the objectives around digital

165
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.899 
skills and competencies.

166
00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.950 
The providence next to the evidence is, of course, that

167
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.874 
by doing all of this, we have hit or rather we have been

168
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.039 
hit by a totally unexpected new situation

169
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.879 
and we have drawn

170
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.990 
some lessons from that.

171
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.489 
This slide presents essentially a snapshot of the closure of schools

172
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.580 
and higher education institutions in Europe in April 2020.

173
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.820 
At this time, we were starting to develop the new digital education action plan.

174
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.289 
And it was immediately clear that while we were supporting

175
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.639 
the member states with data around distance learning,

176
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.519 
ministers were discussing this very heavily in the council,

177
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.259 
exchanging practice on how distance learning can be made

178
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.570 
to work in schools.

179
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.745 
We came very fast to the conclusion that this

180
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.229 
is a significant disruption, literally

181
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.490 
a disruption. So no metaphors here intended.

182
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.862 
And we have decided to inform our work

183
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.777 
on the Digital Education Action Plan with what we call an open public consultation,

184
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.614 
which we organize always when we develop major

185
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.190 
new policy initiatives at the EU level.

186
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.220 
And I would like to share some lessons from this open public consultation.

187
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.748 
First of all, in terms of numbers, this consultation

188
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.630 
was probably the most popular one in the

189
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.999 
field of education that we have had in a number of years.

190
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.068 
We had also, secondly, a very wide variety

191
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.243 
of stakeholders that replied to us, not really only the traditional

192
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.620 
stakeholders that we would expect, but private sector, parents,

193
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.803 
civil society, member states, even public authorities, et

194
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.748 
cetera, et cetera. We have had a very wide

195
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.290 
geographical range as well.

196
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.072 
And of course, we have had some lessons that I would like to quickly

197
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.486 
go through. First, it was quite evident that

198
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.124 
for the majority of the respondents, the experiences with distance

199
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.589 
and online learning were in fact a first.

200
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:33.149 
So this is really happening for the first time for around

201
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.260 
60 percent of those that we have reached out.

202
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.043 
And this is not totally surprising, knowing, of

203
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.620 
course, what we know now.

204
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.679 
But it was already quite an insight.

205
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.879 
And what is also interesting is that a very huge

206
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.350 
majority of those responding to our public consultation

207
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.356 
agreed that the crisis is actually a turning point for

208
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.669 
the use of technology in education.

209
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:11.669 
And what we have done, of course, is a number of challenges that we tried

210
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.210 
to distill without necessarily

211
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.970 
claiming to be statistically representative, but what we have seen is that

212
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:25.619 
the socioeconomic inequalities that have always been there have been

213
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.706 
just made obvious.

214
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.455 
The infrastructure, connectivity problems that we might have been

215
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.650 
perhaps turning a little bit of a blind eye to sometimes

216
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.336 
was a much bigger problem than we thought in

217
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.120 
the year of 2020 with 5G coming in and

218
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.270 
so on.

219
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.322 
Lack of digital training and guidance.

220
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.539 
But also the necessity to have plans when

221
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.779 
one moves to providing education through digital means,

222
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.859 
I was clear and the issue of high quality online

223
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.280 
learning content came about as one of the top challenges.

224
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.039 
Essential for the respondents was that teachers with relevant

225
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.380 
skills are a must.

226
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.210 
But there is also a need for a vision and strategy

227
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.909 
for using this technology, for education.

228
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:34.289 
So all of these lessons, in a way, informed the response of the European

229
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:39.419 
Commission to the covid crisis, but also to the Longer-Term

230
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.399 
Digital Transformation that is going on anyway with or without

231
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.869 
the covid crisis.

232
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:51.059 
And it is in this backdrop that we have put forward the new digital education

233
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.950 
action plan, which we have then adopted by the commission

234
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.110 
in September 2020.

235
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.193 
I would like to contextualize where this action

236
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:07.170 
plan is actually assuming that

237
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.719 
for the majority of people, the European Union is not

238
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.219 
an easy to understand place agreeing with it as well,

239
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.425 
but then explaining what we are here actually

240
00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.539 
doing. Let me start clockwise from the left-hand side here and mention

241
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.959 
that since this new commission under

242
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.989 
the new college, we have an executive vice president

243
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.500 
for 'Europe, fit for the digital age: Miss Vestager,

244
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:46.079 
who oversees the different strands when it comes to this aspect,

245
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.640 
and this includes now also the digital education action plan.

246
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:56.339 
I will come back later on to the need to have a big picture approach to education,

247
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.140 
but then moving clockwise, we have also adopted

248
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.007 
the European Education Area Vision last year in which

249
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:10.109 
we would like to further intensify cooperation in education at EU level.

250
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.210 
And I hope you will agree with me that despite all the limitations

251
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:21.029 
in the competences of the EU in education and training, in fact, the cooperation

252
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.589 
in education in the EU is a success story and I point only to

253
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.383 
Erasmus. But there are other examples here and we believe

254
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.855 
that digital education can be one of the things that take us further, which

255
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.239 
is why we see the action plan as an enabler of this

256
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.859 
European education area.

257
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:46.289 
Thirdly, moving to the right, we have adopted a few months ago

258
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.719 
targets for the digital transformation in

259
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.119 
Europe across various policies.

260
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:59.029 
And what is important is that we have here also targets for digital skills.

261
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.069 
And last but not least, and this is really important, is

262
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.900 
the unprecedented package next generation EU,

263
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.690 
better known as recovery and resilience plans, which the member states

264
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.723 
develop in order to invest in the recovery and resilience

265
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.820 
coming out from the crisis in my current capacity.

266
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.549 
I do look at the recovery plans of each

267
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.029 
and every member state. And what is clear is that the digital education

268
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.849 
is by now probably the top priority when it comes to investment in

269
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.019 
education and training. And what is very important for the commission is that this

270
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.599 
investment goes along with reform.

271
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.316 
And I cannot disclose any data at this stage

272
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.384 
because the commission is in the process of approving the different recovery

273
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.434 
plans. But it is already clear that the trend

274
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.960 
is there and that the member states have recognized the importance of digital education

275
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.099 
going forward.

276
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.082 
What is not here in this slide, but was mentioned kindly

277
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.519 
by the moderator, is that in fact, indeed, the commission has decided to set up new unit

278
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.920 
on digital education, which I have the privilege to be in charge of.

279
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.269 
Now, the characteristics of the new digital education action plans very

280
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.622 
simply and quickly are on the one side to foster

281
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.070 
the development of a high performing digital education ecosystem.

282
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.705 
And this includes the infrastructure, connectivity, the platforms

283
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.390 
and the services, but also the question of the content and on the other hand, to

284
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.209 
enhance digital skills and competences.

285
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.690 
This is an ongoing task, sort of an ever greener.

286
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.200 
It will always be there since the technology's moving all the time.

287
00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.270 
And we really look at these two objectives as the two parts of the same coin,

288
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.030 
not in silos, not in fragmentation, but we try to link them as much as

289
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.319 
possible coherently to each other.

290
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.759 
Second point is that the action plan has now a longer duration, which is

291
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.720 
in line with the programing and budgeting cycle of the European Union,

292
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.229 
which is a seven year cycle.

293
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.082 
And this allows us, of course, to create much more synergies between

294
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.600 
the different funding programs that we have and Erasmus, Horizon,

295
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.020 
Digital Europe.

296
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.479 
But also, of course, what I mentioned earlier, the resilience and the recovery plans

297
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.470 
so that we can perhaps support the member states where we can

298
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.025 
going forward. An extremely important point is the need

299
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.540 
for a sectoral approach in digital education, which means that

300
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.213 
while looking at the verticals, as it were, primary or secondary or

301
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:59.109 
higher is justified in a number of cases.

302
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:03.910 
There is a lot of lessons that we can learn from a cross-sectoral approach.

303
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.940 
And this is why we would like to strengthen this aspect.

304
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.430 
And likewise, it is very important to look at digital education

305
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.681 
investment and to reform in a whole government way, meaning

306
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.576 
that we should not expect that the education authority can solve

307
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.079 
all the problems of the digital education challenge.

308
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.640 
And we can mention here things like connectivity, which are

309
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:35.079 
easy to kind of understand, but we can also mention things like privacy,

310
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.197 
which are also big challenges and require

311
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.160 
a number of policies coming together.

312
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.103 
Last but not least, we are looking at a lifelong learning approach.

313
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.630 
So going beyond formal and informal education.

314
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.739 
Now, what I would like to do next is to put a little bit of a spotlight

315
00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:00.589 
on the question of digital educational content, which, of course for the community here

316
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.920 
is a sort of core competence.

317
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.719 
And I will do this mostly orally, because the work that we have launched in the

318
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.800 
context of the action plan is just starting.

319
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.300 
And I have not explained the

320
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.045 
entirety of the different actions, which I would invite

321
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.970 
you perhaps to consult also in the interest of time.

322
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.339 
There are 14 of them, but reflecting the two priorities.

323
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.779 
But I would like to go a little bit deeper into the

324
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.889 
questions around digital education content and how we

325
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.489 
would like to approach this.

326
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.053 
So the design and the sharing of high-quality content has

327
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:55.009 
been an issue which we have seen coming very strongly from the open public consultation

328
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.900 
as a challenge. It was also mentioned by some of the speakers previously

329
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.940 
and it is not at all a new topic.

330
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.277 
We are very much aware of it, but it has become a very relevant

331
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.459 
one through the covid experience, which

332
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.684 
led to a much higher take-up and use,

333
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.799 
but also production of such content.

334
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.816 
And we observe some trends, both on the supply side and also on the demand

335
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.290 
side, which are interesting. And we just started to look into the into the issue.

336
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.109 
So I would like to tell you a bit more on the way we are looking at this and how we will

337
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.679 
go about it. So from the supply side,

338
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.136 
the traditional producers of education content see the emergence

339
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.779 
of a competing or perhaps complementary supply

340
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:57.037 
from public authorities, from users, via user-generated

341
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.589 
content, but also from commercial players.

342
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.710 
And this is perceived sometimes as a challenge to their business model.

343
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:11.295 
Obviously, this paves the way for a possible transformation of the marketplace, which

344
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:15.760 
we have to observe very, very carefully, as it has been already discusses.

345
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.529 
And this is again building really on some of the

346
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.779 
issues mentioned a bit earlier, we are looking at teachers

347
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.799 
and pupils who are adapting their habits and are becoming

348
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.509 
active co-creators of digital education content.

349
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.709 
And there are many more questions that we are asking

350
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:49.630 
ourselves. For example, what about the exponential increase

351
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.839 
of the availability of such content?

352
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:59.049 
What about the difficulty for the user to find quality and

353
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.869 
trustworthy resources?

354
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.430 
How about the curation and the digital preservation of those resources?

355
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.419 
How do we deal with the need to preserve cultural diversity and

356
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.160 
multilingualism, which is very important for the European Union?

357
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.560 
But also the question around data protection and privacy,

358
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.719 
plus the need to include digital inclusions for all

359
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.859 
pupils. And we are aiming to

360
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.289 
propose this first bullet point,

361
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.140 
which is European digital education content framework.

362
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.324 
We are aiming to propose this in 2023,

363
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.979 
initially focusing on the formal education sector.

364
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.450 
And we see this digital education content framework as an umbrella

365
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.190 
for a possible combination of several soft policy measures.

366
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.469 
They could include, for example, establishing a set of principles

367
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.279 
for high-qualitydigital education content.

368
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.579 
Promoting standardization or other industrial

369
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.654 
agreements, but also incentivizing specific developments

370
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.540 
through funding, for example, through the Erasmus program or from

371
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.120 
other instruments.

372
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.890 
And in doing this, we have a number of challenges.

373
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.789 
I would like to be quite open on this.

374
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.499 
First of all, the lack of data, perspective and analysis on,

375
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.560 
let's say, some of these changes and the understanding of their consequences.

376
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:49.829 
Secondly, the need to identify jointly with you, with the community

377
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:54.329 
and other stakeholders the problems and the areas where, in fact, the European Union

378
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.074 
can add value within its competencies in order to either

379
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.560 
overcome bottlenecks or to perhaps boost the quality of education from

380
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.049 
the perspective of education content, of course.

381
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.330 
And then thirdly, the creation of solutions to this type of problem

382
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.198 
together with the stakeholders. And this is very, very important for us because we

383
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.089 
need to ensure that.

384
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.365 
All education doctors embrace this type of solution and

385
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.000 
also commit to their sustainability.

386
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.180 
So the way we go about this is that, first of all, we are working on an in-depth

387
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.159 
analysis right now on the supply and demand side of digital education

388
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.260 
content.

389
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.349 
We are also organizing consultations with stakeholders.

390
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.584 
And I know that some of you here have been part of it or might be.

391
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:48.589 
And I would like to thank you for this.

392
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.819 
And thirdly, we will also map the different models of how the member

393
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.839 
states deal with the issues around digital education content

394
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.679 
so that we can draw lessons and perhaps support the exchange of good practice.

395
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.919 
So it's quite natural that I'm quite pleased today here to be with you,

396
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.512 
since, as I said, you are really at the centreof this type

397
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.670 
of issue.

398
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.583 
Secondly, just a few words on the European exchange platform, which

399
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.419 
is so far a proposal only, which is undergoing

400
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.009 
a feasibility study for the time being, which we have launched two months

401
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.299 
ago. And here the idea would be to

402
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:38.069 
think about providing better conditions for the delivery of

403
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.690 
high quality, multilingual digital education content that

404
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:47.729 
would address data privacy concerns, but also the need for more secure

405
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.070 
and trustworthy tools.

406
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.367 
Currently, this feasibility study is exploring such a

407
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.769 
creation of a platform that could serve as a repository,

408
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.160 
but also some other possible functions.

409
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.830 
And the scope is not yet determined.

410
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:10.349 
We are looking into the possible sector and let me stress

411
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.094 
that we are very, very aware of the high quality content

412
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.479 
that is already available and that many of you are working on.

413
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.453 
And we do not in any way intend to duplicate any existing

414
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.869 
or in the making initiatives.

415
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.009 
So far, what we think is that this could make high quality EU

416
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.920 
content more visible and accessible.

417
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.809 
We are currently conducting this study in close cooperation

418
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.540 
with the stakeholders.

419
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:46.079 
We already had a very interesting seminar where we saw that

420
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.509 
one possible way of looking at this European exchange platform is in fact

421
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.599 
in terms of its potential for pooling capacity for the European universities

422
00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.330 
that I think you might be familiar with.

423
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:07.289 
So in the next phase, we will include some in-depth interviews with potential users

424
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:11.700 
and platform providers. And I would like to invite you to take part in that

425
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.170 
interview series if you are interested in.

426
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.859 
Let me finish by looking at the future

427
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.640 
from the past to the present and looking at the future,

428
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.970 
it is notoriously difficult to say anything about it, but

429
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:34.040 
perhaps reflecting the vision that we have set out in our

430
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.059 
key documents so far.

431
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.375 
Let me mention that, first of all, we need to conceive of digital

432
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:46.099 
education as a strategic goal that helps to address

433
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.910 
the digital transformation of society.

434
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.179 
It is not isolated from the transformation of society.

435
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.730 
It is part of it. And it is very important that we are creative and find ways,

436
00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.239 
even if we are sometimes limited from specific, legal or other points of view.

437
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.269 
It is also very important what we have suggested as universal

438
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.380 
digital education, which is inclusive and accessible for all.

439
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.585 
Education is a basic human right, and if one is cut off

440
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.740 
from it for whatever reasons, beat from the physical

441
00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.869 
point of view or for some other reasons, then we need to deploy whatever is possible to

442
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.519 
make it accessible for everyone.

443
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.390 
And I cannot think of better technology than the digital one to do that.

444
00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.299 
Obviously, there are many limitations to it as well.

445
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.890 
But universal digital education is something that we have put forward now

446
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.619 
as a vision in the digital decade.

447
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.300 
Teachers and trainers are absolutely central for making this

448
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.970 
happen, and we have to invest more in the continuous development,

449
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.849 
professional development, reskilling and upskilling.

450
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.378 
A very important point is to understand that we need

451
00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:02.079 
to arrive at an even deeper understanding of the digital world.

452
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.089 
I would like to compare this to the way we perceive the physical one.

453
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.609 
Everyone knows what gravity is about, and we need to be aware

454
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:17.859 
that there are certain laws and ways of happening,

455
00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.500 
of things in the digital world that are as powerful.

456
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.023 
And digital skills and competencies are critical for employability,

457
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.933 
for citizenship. But we would like to support a

458
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.300 
deeper understanding through education of what the digital world is about.

459
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.500 
For example, by promoting computer science either

460
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:43.989 
in a wider discipline's way of teaching

461
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:48.689 
or to an earlier start computational thinking.

462
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.799 
All of this is very, very important.

463
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.890 
I have mentioned the importance of digital education content in the context, however,

464
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.569 
of secure platforms of privacy and interoperability

465
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.459 
which reflect European values.

466
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:08.559 
As we know, some of these values are not identical around the world.

467
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.903 
And a critical aspect for us to make this happen, together with the community

468
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.491 
and with the stakeholders, is to promote cross-sector cooperation and

469
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:22.719 
innovation. And I'm happy to announce today, as it happens,

470
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.480 
that we have this morning launched an open call for Tender to set up the digital

471
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:32.949 
education hub that will help us develop better

472
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.839 
cooperation and exchange at the European level on digital education.

473
00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:41.340 
This is an idea which came from the community last year.

474
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:45.280 
We have followed up through on it and this morning we have launched the call.

475
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.989 
I invite you to check out our twitter handle and to see

476
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.814 
the details there. And let me finish by saying

477
00:34:55.239 --> 00:35:00.129 
that transforming education in the digital age is not

478
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.940 
something for one authority or for one part

479
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.079 
of the government. It is a societal challenge.

480
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.969 
It is also shared accountability.

481
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:14.469 
And we are going to do our bit from the European Commission point of view and we

482
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.220 
count on everyone to be part of this.

483
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:20.735 
So I would like to thank you for your attention and I look forward to continuing this

484
00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.361 
discussion together with you. You see here the Twitter data where you

485
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.669 
can find and follow us. Thank you very much.

486
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:35.189 
Thank you very much, Dr. Dimitar, for this for this very, very interesting insights

487
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.960 
and information since there is some time left.

488
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.989 
We have the possibility to take some questions

489
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.900 
from the audience and whoever joined,

490
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.640 
whoever joined later. I welcome you on board for the emu's

491
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.410 
conference and to opening keynotes.

492
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.019 
And as I can see in the chat, I already

493
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.070 
have the first question to please

494
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.409 
give some more information on the education.

495
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.450 
How?

496
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.320 
Yes, thank you very much, Christiane, and thank you very much, Monica,

497
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:23.950 
for your question.

498
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.820 
Yes, I can today finally say something about it, because so far I was bound by conflict,

499
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.369 
by a conflict of interest, if I would say something.

500
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.139 
But since this is public today, as of this morning, and I would just

501
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.379 
share right now the link in the chat.

502
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.050 
But let me say a few words on the digital education hub.

503
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.141 
The idea for the digital education hub came really from the

504
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.849 
community last spring in a very Bottom-Up

505
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.739 
way. And the key aspect for this was that

506
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.749 
there was no real cooperation mechanism at the EU level to support digital

507
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.809 
education while we were in the middle of a.

508
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:13.019 
Very difficult situation between March and June, and we realize

509
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.120 
that even to share experience on how distance learning can be implemented,

510
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.510 
we have to go back to some real basics.

511
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.530 
So we realize that we have actually some work to do.

512
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.329 
And the community came to us with the proposal for the digital education

513
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.019 
hub, which we have now

514
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.558 
worked on and presented this morning in the call for

515
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.088 
Tender. What I can tell you about digital education.

516
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:44.709 
Cupps Objective is the following.

517
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.140 
First of all, we would like to support the

518
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.970 
creation, engagement and mobilization of a digital

519
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:58.500 
education community across sectors.

520
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.521 
We know that there is already a lot of different communities out there which do an

521
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.290 
excellent job and we would like to bring them together

522
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.579 
and perhaps to give them some momentum.

523
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.719 
So it will be very important to allow this community

524
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.380 
to express themselves and to provide also their

525
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.630 
ideas and problems and also solutions.

526
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.339 
Why? Because we have also realized, secondly, that no matter how

527
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.139 
hard we try at the EU level, we can never be as fast as those

528
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.080 
who are actually on the ground, who are responsible directly

529
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.249 
for the education and training sector.

530
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.329 
So we would like to enable this.

531
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:48.679 
Secondly, we would like to promote actively knowledge exchange,

532
00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.532 
meaning the exchange of best practices, what works well in some member states in digital

533
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.358 
education, so that this knowledge goes without a lot

534
00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:03.530 
of filters, without the, let's say, necessary sectoral,

535
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.642 
let's say, a filter that it goes to maybe the community in

536
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.040 
the other member states and it can be taken and perhaps reused or somehow

537
00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.070 
make sense of.

538
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.320 
So this is a very important aspect for us to enable exchange

539
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.590 
and cooperation and best practice at the EU level.

540
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:28.069 
Again, we do not really do this today in a concrete

541
00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:32.060 
manner. We have some more high-leveldiscussions.

542
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.575 
And last important objective with the digital education hub is to

543
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.209 
promote really a spirit of innovation and

544
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.840 
an acceleration of good ideas into policy.

545
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.029 
So the way we look at this is that if the practice is working

546
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.423 
well somewhere, we all know that good practice is nothing

547
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.060 
without being scaled. And we believe that in the policy-making

548
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.699 
that we are today in, we cannot be using the same cycles of policy

549
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.790 
development of multiple years.

550
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.120 
We need to have much faster feedback loops.

551
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:13.576 
So this is what we also expect from the digital education hub to find ways

552
00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:19.760 
to come up with clear, maybe also

553
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:24.770 
sensitive issues which are addressing

554
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:29.126 
digital education, where we all know that we have a problem and where perhaps we can

555
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.300 
solve it together.

556
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.242 
The this call that I have mentioned will be for activities

557
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:38.590 
to support the digital education hub.

558
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:43.489 
It will not be the hub itself, but it will be a very important part of it

559
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:47.329 
and it will run over three years.

560
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:50.260 
The budget is up to four point six billion euros.

561
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.989 
So it is a very substantial project that we are launching here today.

562
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.699 
Akerlof and I will try to now

563
00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:03.409 
copy the link to the chart

564
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.970 
on the question for the European universities.

565
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:14.239 
Yes, we are absolutely in line with the European Universities

566
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.070 
Project, and we would like even to see synergies between

567
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:23.809 
the digital education hub, in particular in the field of higher education,

568
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:27.739 
where we expect there to be some focus and some exchanges.

569
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.989 
And we would like to take this and to feed this back also into the emerging

570
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.070 
community of the European universities alliances.

571
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:42.169 
So this is what what I could tell you, perhaps on the on the digital education

572
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.170 
hub.

573
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:48.880 
I don't know, Christiane, if you would like me to respond to some other aspects.

574
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:53.749 
Yes, I would like to take one question that came through the queue and a

575
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.010 
function for the on the webinar form.

576
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:01.898 
I have twice now. And he is asking, do you think it is more important to

577
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.550 
fund platforms for digital education or the creation of material

578
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:12.330 
itself as open educational resources as I understood the platform way?

579
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.879 
What about the content?

580
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.421 
It's a very good question, many thanks, it's a bit of a chicken and egg type of question.

581
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.260 
So I think we

582
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:29.622 
have identified first and foremost the question of access as being a

583
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.349 
problematic one. It may well be that this is driven

584
00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.909 
by the covid primarily situation, but we have

585
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.879 
identified the question of access as being fundamental

586
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.530 
because of the exclusion that has happened for many.

587
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:52.659 
We have seen that simply put, some have not been able to access the

588
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:53.810 
content.

589
00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.250 
And then it's a second question. If this content was there or not, and

590
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.010 
in what form and how how it was certified, what was it?

591
00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.629 
What was the quality assurance behind it? So this is why we are thinking about the

592
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.849 
question of the platform first.

593
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.770 
And there I want to be just very clear that we are

594
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.750 
very carefully elaborating on this question because we are very aware of the

595
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.429 
intricacies and difficulties around the creation of any platform.

596
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.272 
In fact, in my experience and so far, I have been involved

597
00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:31.658 
in closing platforms. So we are very aware of the of

598
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.889 
the difficult questions one needs to ask.

599
00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:40.289 
But let's say our first entry point is on the access.

600
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:44.006 
However, what I want to add as a comment is that the question of

601
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:49.989 
the creation of resources and content is going forward.

602
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.760 
Absolutely critical, because what we have observed

603
00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.599 
in the covid, it may well be that it was just the emergency.

604
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.069 
Remote teaching and learning is that many people move to analog,

605
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.619 
to digital and just basically went online.

606
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:10.420 
We did. And we know that this is not how the hybrid universities or the hybrid

607
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.129 
education will work.

608
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:18.519 
We have already good evidence on what is a good instructional design for

609
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:22.732 
also online learning. So we need to make sure that when creating and designing

610
00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.929 
content, we also put instructional design methodologies

611
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.639 
that correspond to the pedagogical experience into the creation process.

612
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:38.159 
So I personally think that also the

613
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:42.609 
funding of content is an important aspect that

614
00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.440 
we will explore.

615
00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:49.089 
And we are currently discussing this in the context of the next annual

616
00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.488 
call for Erasmus, which however will be for twenty twenty two.

617
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.770 
So it is still to be confirmed.

618
00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:01.300 
Thank you. We still have some time and there is another interesting question

619
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.729 
from Vietnamese that she's asking what are the main approaches in perceiving

620
00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:10.129 
multilingual gravity and educational content?

621
00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.429 
So what is your take on?

622
00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:21.079 
Yes, from our perspective, anything

623
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.789 
that is put forward by the European Union has

624
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.093 
to be by default, multilingual, and this is, of

625
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.880 
course, a different type of challenge than when it happens on a member state level.

626
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.510 
So we, of course, are very much aware that this

627
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:45.230 
is something that we at the commission level perhaps pay

628
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.239 
very, very special attention to.

629
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.994 
But, well, I think that we

630
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.909 
have a policy and this is what I can say to this to this question.

631
00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.042 
We have a policy where essentially any

632
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.119 
type of specific platform that we run have

633
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.909 
to be available in all the different languages.

634
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.889 
And to to to operate the functions is very

635
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.369 
easy. That's not difficult.

636
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:20.149 
What is much more difficult is when the content itself has

637
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:24.329 
to be translated and then, of course, quality assured.

638
00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.359 
So I cannot comment a lot

639
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.310 
more than just acknowledging that this is a very, very significant

640
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.610 
problem. And this is why I have mentioned it in the context of the platform.

641
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.300 
This is one of the questions that we are asking ourselves.

642
00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:44.839 
To what extent we can, let's say, reflect

643
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:51.332 
the need that we identify for multilingualism, which is basically for anything

644
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.514 
that we do to respect the cultural diversity of the member states.

645
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.490 
And of course, it is rooted in the in the in the languages ultimately.

646
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.917 
So I'm afraid that for the time being, I can say only

647
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:05.790 
that.

648
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.639 
One last question before we move on, and that goes from

649
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.709 
Max and Donna on the question he's asking

650
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.949 
other research, is the research existing on the importance

651
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:28.199 
of face to face learning for children between four and five years

652
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.079 
and eight years compared to digital learning?

653
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:35.460 
So are they research results, you know, of

654
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:41.340 
which reflect how important is Face-To-Face learning versus digital learning?

655
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:44.709 
This is this is an excellent question.

656
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:48.719 
Thank you very much, Matteus, for it. I would like to see our longitudinal study say

657
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.119 
ten years comparing both.

658
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:54.780 
Unfortunately, I don't think there is anything like that just because no one

659
00:47:55.770 --> 00:48:00.230 
no one probably thought that would be a real sort of research question.

660
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.790 
But now for sure it is one.

661
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:07.590 
No, I'm not aware of anything that is EU EU

662
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:12.809 
encompassing. I'm aware of some some studies that

663
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:17.369 
look at the relative impact primarily of

664
00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:21.145 
blended and then just the pure online, but not compared

665
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.469 
to a counterfactual like the like, let's say physical.

666
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.899 
However, what I can already say here is that

667
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:37.320 
this question of blended learning in particular for the children that you

668
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.805 
have put forward, there is something that we have been very, very

669
00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.510 
busy with from the point of view of the adaptation

670
00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:51.479 
that at least our primary and secondary

671
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:56.249 
education and training systems need to prepare for in

672
00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.689 
case there would be the situation that we have experienced again.

673
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:05.870 
And we have looked at a lot of practices that tell

674
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.929 
something about how a school can prepare for this.

675
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.330 
This is not linked to our recommendation to do it.

676
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.920 
So just to be clear, but it's more about the

677
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:24.269 
planning that needs to go there, the engagement of the also of the parents,

678
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:29.219 
the type of pedagogical methods that can be used if

679
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.425 
it happens. And in fact, we will be proposing

680
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.459 
as part of the action plan. I have not mentioned it because it was not intended

681
00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:43.139 
to list all actions that we work on, but in fact, the very first action

682
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:47.369 
that we are going to complete and I hope it will be just in a few weeks from now

683
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.619 
is a proposal for a council recommendation on blended learning in primary and secondary.

684
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:57.660 
So in this proposal, we are essentially providing some

685
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.080 
tools and guidance on what can

686
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.519 
be used to make the process of blended

687
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.852 
learning more effective. But it does not yet reply to your question,

688
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.641 
of course, whether this is ultimately, ultimately more more effective

689
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.159 
and how does it compare to the pure face to face?

690
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:21.659 
Thank you.

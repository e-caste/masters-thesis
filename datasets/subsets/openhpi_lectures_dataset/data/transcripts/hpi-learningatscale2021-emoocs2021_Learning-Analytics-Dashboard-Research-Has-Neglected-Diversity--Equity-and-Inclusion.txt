00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.440 
hi my name's kimberly Williamson and i'm a phd student at cornell
university.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.850 
and i'm here to present our paper on learning analytics

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.210 
dashboard research has neglected diversity equity inclusion,

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.310 
which is a critical literature review of learning analytics dashboards.

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.140 
i did this project in collaboration with my advisor
doctor RenÃ© F. Kiezilcec

6
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.590 
as part of the cornell future of learning lab.

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.950 
so the first question that you might ask is do we actually

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.570 
need another dashboard review. there's been quite a lot.

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.370 
but what we noticed was the current landscape has reviews focusing

10
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.930 
mainly on students and how students use the dashboard or they're

11
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.920 
talking about the deployment of from the university's
technical structure,

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.090 
or they're geared towards a specific learning theory such as self-regulated learning.

13
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.170 
these also tended to be systematic or comprehensive literature reviews.

14
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
but we found what is missing was a need for constructive criticism

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.080 
of digital technologies in higher education.

16
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.990 
and this is more important in the recent calls
to highlight diversity equity

17
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.700 
and inclusion efforts across many different education research areas.

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.500 
so with that in mind we chose three research questions to guide

19
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.060 
us through this process which is how does a ladd research contribute

20
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.310 
to improving diversity equity inclusion.

21
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.380 
how might lights contribute to maintaining or
exasperating inequitable outcomes,

22
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
what are the future opportunities to improve diversity equity

23
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.860 
inclusion in learning analytics dashboard research?

24
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.980 
to answer these questions. we did a critical literature review

25
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.220 
where we sought to reveal weaknesses, contradictions,
controversies or inconsistencies

26
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.980 
within the learning analytics dashboard research.

27
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.080 
in order to highlight problems discrepancies or areas in which

28
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.970 
the existing knowledge about a topic is untrustworthy,

29
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.460 
as mentioned before we are focusing on diversity equity inclusion

30
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.430 
and these tend to be problems that you really do have to take

31
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.860 
a critical lens to understand how they're working within the larger research area.

32
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
there are two major differences between this in
systematic and comprehensive reviews.

33
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.480 
when there's a lot less papers opposed to sampling every single

34
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.120 
paper that talks about a topic such as dashboards a self-regulated learning,

35
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.670 
use a lot less to cover more areas with a critical lens.

36
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.260 
so this allows us to cover this topic of a diversity equity

37
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.730 
inclusion across all dashboards a very broad opposed

38
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.450 
to a very narrow overview.

39
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.910 
in order to get to our final selection of forty papers
we had inclusion criteria,

40
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.730 
as far as making sure there was a student component.

41
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.090 
it was used in higher education in the research
was empirical research methods.

42
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.100 
and then we use the search terms of higher education dashboard

43
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.080 
and google scholar learning at scale lak and journal
of learning analytics.

44
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.100 
so our findings with three which is as can be hinted by the

45
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.450 
title we did not actually find current research about
diversity equity inclusion.

46
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.860 
we found several missed opportunities and a paper that talked about using

47
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.120 
that type of data in a dashboard but due to ethical
concerns decided not to.

48
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.520 
so we don't think there are solution opportunities.

49
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.720 
another project was equity scoreboard project.
we think is a great place

50
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.850 
to look for best practices for is d i. now given that they were

51
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.570 
at the university structure approach to the more

52
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.150 
micro level of student level that most lads concentrate on they.

53
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.700 
this project was not included in the review.

54
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.580 
the second finding is maintaining systemic inequities and lad research.

55
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.510 
so lad researchers are really special in that a lot of people

56
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.250 
who are the researchers are also the practitioners.
and so they have disability to

57
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.090 
close this disconnect especially, as it comes to d i issues

58
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.310 
by making sure the same goals are being

59
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.470 
achieved in research and as an practice.

60
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.570 
and lastly we covered future work for d i in LADs. and please

61
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.260 
look to our paper for more information about this. but the last

62
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.080 
kind of bullet point i want to leave you with is we believe

63
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.390 
there can be more intentional use of learning analytics dashboards

64
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.250 
to inform higher education diversity equity inclusion efforts.

65
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.940 
thank you very much.

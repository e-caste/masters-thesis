00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.880 
I want to introduce our
new offer on OpenHPI,

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.110 
you can combine courses on
Cybersecurity Basics.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.620 
You can combine it in a way
that you can receive a

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.820 
Record of Achievement or a
certificate for a six week course.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.340 
So the idea is, we offer various two
week OpenHPI workshops focusing on

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.630 
different topics in the
basics of cybersecurity.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.350 
You can combine this, you can take
part in all the three courses,

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.420 
you can combine it and take
an exam. And on the basis of

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.180 
that you can obtain a certificate
that's equivalent to a certificate

10
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
of a six week course. The procedure
is as follows, you have to enroll

11
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.290 
in all three courses if you want to
take part in these combined courses,

12
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.850 
you have to receive a confirmation
of participation for each

13
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.950 
of the three courses and you need
to enroll for the corresponding

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.630 
Exam-courses. This exam course consists
only of a final exam

15
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.790 
that covers all three courses in
cybersecurity. And then you can

16
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
receive a Record of Achievement or even a
qualified certificate with credit points

17
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.450 
for successful completion of the
exam and the three courses. And

18
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.470 
you know successful completion means that
you receive at least fifty percent

19
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.520 
of the total points. And these are
three courses, the three two week courses

20
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.100 
on cybersecurity
basics. The first is a

21
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.670 
course about confidential
communication in the internet.

22
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.680 
It starts on 13th January 2021.

23
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.090 
The confidential
communication in the internet

24
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.930 
is important because the internet
is an open network, all data

25
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
are transferred in open channels, everyone
also cyber criminals have access

26
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.650 
to the internet can consider what's
transferred over the internet.

27
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.420 
So to secure your data

28
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
and protect them for manipulation
and eavesdropping, is that you

29
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
use technologies and methods for
encryption and digital signature.

30
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.820 
So the goal of this course is
to sensitize the users about

31
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.840 
the risk of data transfer in the internet
and to introduce the protection measures.

32
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.540 
Protection measures by
cryptographic technologies

33
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.990 
and their application
in real world.

34
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.420 
Second, a short workshop we are
providing about digital identities.

35
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.530 
This course starts on
27th January 2021

36
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.060 
and asks the question,
"who am I on the internet?"

37
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.600 
If you want to use a digital services such as online
banking, social media, online shopping,

38
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.080 
you need a digital
identity.

39
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.280 
So such digital identities need
to be established, need to be

40
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.370 
verified, and bound to a physical person
and are of extremely high interest

41
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.370 
for cybercriminals. So the goal
of that course is to introduce

42
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.530 
the concept of digital identities and
the topic of identity management

43
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000 
to present different methods for
authentication and verification, that's

44
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.760 
needed to allow a person to use
a digital identity for their

45
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
interaction with a digital service,
and to give hints on how to secure

46
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.350 
such digital identities
against attacks.

47
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.990 
And then the third
2-week workshop,

48
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.900 
it starts on 10th February tenth 2021.

49
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.490 
It is about cyberthreats by Malware.

50
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.570 
Malware or Malicious software is one of the
biggest threats in the internet.

51
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.070 
So the target of malware can be multi
million dollar companies

52
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.260 
as well as private computers,
laptops, and smartphones.

53
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.150 
And what we want to present you in
the course is an introduction

54
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.010 
to the different types of malware,
together with cyber attacks

55
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.390 
which they enable. We want to
discuss how one can get infected

56
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.620 
by such malware, how this malware
finds its ways to your computer or

57
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.190 
to the computer of a company and then of
course we will discuss how to protect

58
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.810 
own system against
malware infection.

59
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.530 
So in this OpenHPI combined
course on cybersecurity basics,

60
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.590 
it is open for everyone who wants
to understand and learn more

61
00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.970 
about the basics of cybersecurity. There are no
participation requirements necessary, everyone

62
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.980 
is welcome, everyone can take
part. And as usual, the course

63
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.020 
includes short learning videos,
interactive quizzes and tasks,

64
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.450 
it provides the possibility of forum discussions
with other learners about all the

65
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.010 
treated topics, and it
provides related material,

66
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.590 
and then various certificates
can be received. A Confirmation

67
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.350 
of Participation for each course, a Record
of Achievement for all the 3 courses,

68
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.630 
and a qualified
certificate with 2

69
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.530 
credit points. So here are all the
details about the examination in

70
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.540 
combined course on
cybersecurity basics.

71
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.820 
Confirmation of participation
is available for each course,

72
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.180 
so for all learners that worked on at
least 80% of the material,

73
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.050 
they get in each of the 3 courses.

74
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.290 
Then it's also possible to get
marked confirmation of

75
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.700 
participation also for each single course.

76
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.090 
This is for all learners that have successfully
completed the marked weekly assignments,

77
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.730 
and successfully means, at least 50%
of the total points are reached.

78
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.500 
Then for all 3 courses, over
the combined course and cyber

79
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.940 
security basics, you can get
a Record of Achievement.

80
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.990 
Record of Achievement is available for
learners that received confirmation

81
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.670 
of participation for each
of the 3 courses,

82
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.940 
and successfully a completed the
combined exam which is provided

83
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:02.080 
in the exam course. And then you can get
even a qualified certificate for the

84
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.730 
combined courses on cyber security
basics with 2 credit points.

85
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.650 
Same requirements need to be fulfilled
as for the Record of Achievement,

86
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:20.450 
but during the exam an online
proctoring is necessary so that

87
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.440 
you get the qualified certificate
which really shows you

88
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.300 
that you have managed

89
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.650 
all the course exams and know

90
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.150 
about the basics of security.

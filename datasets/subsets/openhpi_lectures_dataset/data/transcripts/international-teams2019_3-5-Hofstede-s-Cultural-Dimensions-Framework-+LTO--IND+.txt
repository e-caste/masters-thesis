00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.780 
Ok Hanadi you just mentioned four
dimensions and we have still

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.920 
another two to discuss?...yes and as we
said these are Hofstedes dimensions.

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.140 
There are many
other frameworks.

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.270 
But we are just presenting
one framework here,

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.470 
let's talk now about long
term versus short term

6
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.100 
orientation and indulgence
vs restraint.

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.560 
For the long term and short
term orientation this

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.740 
stands for time and planning
for the future. So in the

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.690 
long term orientation, the
focus will be on the future,

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.130 
while in the short term orientation
the focus will be on the

11
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.560 
present with some
linkage to the past.

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
And that's why countries
and in the long term

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.810 
orientation you would see like
they save money like people

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.990 
tend to plan to buy something.... they
plan for the future and there is

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.520 
an emphasis on persistent and
they save money and they adapt

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.850 
usually to changing circumstances
in order to achieve their

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.760 
goals in the future but people
in the short term orientation

18
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.060 
countries they emphasis on
quick results they want

19
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.830 
the results to be achieved as
quick as possible and usually

20
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.350 
they seek immediate gratification
and since they have

21
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.830 
this link to the past as they
tend to respect traditions they

22
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.610 
have their national pride and they
are willing to fulfill social

23
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.630 
obligations, let's have a
little bit of comparison

24
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.620 
like just a few examples
probably because people like

25
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.450 
to save money in countries that
comes on the long term orientation

26
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.140 
a study proved that secondary
school students perform well

27
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.270 
at mathematics... I don't
know, but that's what

28
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.560 
the study says and they like
they have large savings and

29
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.410 
funds available for investment
and usually investors in those

30
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.040 
countries tend to support family
business and real estate business

31
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.850 
and they are usually in poor
countries that come on this scale

32
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.830 
they tend to have faster
economic growth

33
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.010 
while four countries a that comes
on the shorter orientation

34
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.270 
secondary school students actually
perform poorly at mathematics.

35
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.090 
....I can understand this fifth
model as a kind of stereotyping

36
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.600 
about how countries behave,
I believe these models,

37
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.690 
the five models we have already
seen are just a reference

38
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.740 
to consider they are not just
the things are like that.....

39
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.960 
no as I said, Hofstede's studies are
cultural differences for educate

40
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.970 
and he compared thousands of
datas and based on that he came

41
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.430 
up with this dimension this
is giving us a reference.

42
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.030 
.....Exactly, so countries
who come on the short term

43
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.950 
investors usually support
shares and mutual funds

44
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.850 
and in poor countries you would
notice a slower economic

45
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.320 
across. Now let's talk about
indulgence vs restraint

46
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.190 
a indulgent society are those that
allow actually the expression

47
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.670 
of one's inner feelings to others,
while in a society that are

48
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.830 
restrained they discourage
this kind of expression.

49
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.660 
A weak control is called indulgence
while a strong control

50
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.890 
is called restraint. Let's take
examples, in the indulgence

51
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.190 
counter-culture you would
see many happy people

52
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.810 
the percentage of happy
people is really high

53
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.220 
because they can express whatever
they want, they can enjoy

54
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.220 
their life and they care less
about moral disciplines and you

55
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.860 
would notice lower death rates
and also they actually place

56
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.000 
a great importance on leisure
and having friends, going

57
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.310 
out just enjoying life, while
in the restraint cultures

58
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.970 
a it's normal to see a lower
percentage of very happy people

59
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.140 
because usually they are
actually oppressed and

60
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.550 
they feel helpless and that's
why there is a higher

61
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.670 
death rate and they have very
strict moral disciplines.

62
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.450 
....I believe here we also have
to discuss what means happiness

63
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.770 
for people in the restraint
culture happiness means

64
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.100 
something different. Probably
in your community you

65
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.420 
have something to share with us?
Do you see yourself planning

66
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.740 
for the future? Do you seek quick
results for today for tomorrow?

67
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.880 
What do you see your country in
terms of indulgence and restraints

68
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.920 
even if in your countries
as I mentioned before

69
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.860 
probably part of your country
something will be different

70
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.190 
compared to where you are located, please
join the discussion we will be looking

71
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.400 
forward for that thank you
Hanadi,.. Thank you Salim

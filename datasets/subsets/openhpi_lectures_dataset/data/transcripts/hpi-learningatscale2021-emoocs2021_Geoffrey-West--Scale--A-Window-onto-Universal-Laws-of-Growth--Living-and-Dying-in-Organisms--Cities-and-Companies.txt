00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.310 
Up next is our amazing first keynote and I'm going to turn it over

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.940 
I think to Thomas who will take us into our keynote session.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.950 
Thanks everybody and enjoy the event.

4
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.390 
Thanks to all of you for this great introduction and

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.090 
I will keep myself completely short because I really want

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.890 
to hand over to Geoffrey West. I'll

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.880 
just mention one thing - he's been selected for Time Magazine's

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.700 
list of the hundred most influential people in the world and

9
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
I bought his book Scale, I read it and I have to admit that one of the

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.290 
main reasons why I bought it was that it mentioned that it

11
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.810 
will reveal if Godzilla would be a possibility in the real

12
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.350 
world or not and I'm really looking forward to how

13
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.090 
his ideas can be

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.710 
applied also to the world of education and

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.300 
the stage is yours. Thank you so much for joining us.

16
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.870 
So, you know, this is very much the big picture and I don't know

17
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.690 
directly whether it will have relevance to the kinds of things that

18
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.700 
all these fascinating topics that

19
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
this meeting is dedicated to,

20
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
but I do want to give a kind of way of thinking and a conceptual

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.700 
framework that I hope does feed into some of the thinking as

22
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.380 
you try to scale up this extraordinary challenge of

23
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.070 
educating not just the hundreds of thousands but hundreds of millions of people

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.340 
at all levels of life, across the whole spectrum of

25
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.060 
capabilities. Now, I'm not going to talk, despite

26
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.950 
the title, I decide I won't talk about companies but I will

27
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.030 
say a few words about universities.

28
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.480 
So, I'm going to begin with something quite simple and

29
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.150 
i'm going to start with the historical view and show you a

30
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.360 
picture of Galileo because not only is Galileo sort of the

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.480 
founder of modern science but he actually introduced the concept of scale

32
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.230 
and some of the ideas at the very beginning

33
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.810 
in his great work the dialogue concerning the new sciences and

34
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.490 
he sort of had all the ideas already there and I want to present

35
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.210 
in a very simplified form what he thought about and he started thinking about

36
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.860 
limits to growth in terms of the strength of pillars and limbs

37
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.110 
and legs and arms and so on,

38
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.230 
and he realized something sort of very profound but extraordinarily simple about scale.

39
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.750 
And that is that the strength of a pillar, a column or a limb

40
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.700 
is proportional to its cross-sectional area, it's not doesn't depend

41
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.670 
on its length, whereas what it has to hold up - your body or building

42
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.430 
is and so it goes like a volume. So the strength of a limb or beam

43
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.260 
is proportional, goes up as you scale up the system as you increase

44
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.080 
all its length simultaneously goes like a length squared but

45
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.060 
the weight goes like a volume which goes like a length cubed.

46
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.280 
Therefore if you keep scaling up

47
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.000 
and you don't change anything, then the system will collapse

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.850 
under its own weight. And that leads to a limit to growth and

49
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.350 
what he realized was in order to circumvent that, you can do

50
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.290 
either of two things - you change the design you go from invent

51
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.660 
arches you go from arches to the kind of suspensions and then

52
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.220 
you have to change materials of wood to steel and maybe titanium

53
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.620 
or you do both and that's been the whole history of

54
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.520 
architecture and engineering in the physical world but also

55
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.170 
it turns out in social world and I will come to that later on.

56
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.210 
But this is the great driver of innovation; that's what

57
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.980 
drives innovation is this

58
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.270 
continuous drive of scalability. So scalability

59
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.540 
plays an incredibly important role and it's obviously related

60
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.670 
to the resilience of a system, its adaptability in evolvability and to growth.

61
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.520 
So I'm going to start very quickly go through some extraordinary observations about animals

62
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.950 
and I'm going to start with us, namely us as a mammal.

63
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.300 
We're one of these and remarkably we cover a range in weight

64
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.160 
of about one hundred million from the tiny shrew to the blue whale

65
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.920 
and we look different and we've evolved differently

66
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.620 
obviously. We've evolved each organ, each

67
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.610 
cell type, each genome in us has its own unique history.

68
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.340 
Yet there is some commonality

69
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.590 
but you would have expected because of that unique history, the historical contingency,

70
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.540 
that if you plotted any physiological variable, any characteristic

71
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.250 
of these organisms versus the size - the graph would be spread

72
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.260 
the points were spread all over the map but they're not and

73
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.930 
is the most fundamental quantity

74
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.270 
of any system in fact, metabolic rate - how much food or energy

75
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.220 
you need per day to stay alive and is plotted logarithmically, which means simply

76
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.060 
as you can see on this graph going up by factors of ten in

77
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.440 
both directions. So you get everything on one page, and what

78
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.710 
you see is underlying this extraordinary diversity and complexity

79
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.780 
is an extraordinary simplicity and everybody lies on this same line

80
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.190 
and the other extraordinary characteristic of this graph

81
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.760 
is that the slope of it is a very simple number - three quarters,

82
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.960 
which is less than one, which means if you think about it,

83
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.820 
that the bigger you are the less energy is needed per gram

84
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.940 
of tissue or per cell to stay alive. So an elephant is more

85
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.690 
efficient so to speak than a horse and that's more efficient than

86
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.030 
you and me and we're more efficient than a mouse, in a systematic predictable way.

87
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.790 
So this is extraordinary, so that just in terms of metabolism

88
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.900 
we're so scaled versions of one another but it turns out this is true of

89
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.020 
anything that you measure about us in terms of our physiology or life history

90
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.790 
and it's true across the entire spectrum of organisms, from

91
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.720 
cells to ecosystems and I'm just going to give a flash through a

92
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.160 
bunch of examples to illustrate that first of all something

93
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.540 
somewhat mundane namely heart rate, heart rate decreases systematically

94
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.350 
and here it is that same plot logarithmically and then the slope of that

95
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.430 
is one quarter, the other one was three quarters,

96
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.520 
is the radius of your aorta. The aorta is the first tube that

97
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.030 
comes out of your heart feeding your

98
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.040 
circulatory system and that scales with a slope of three eighths

99
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.280 
and it turns out that's exactly the same as tree trunks. So

100
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.870 
there's this sort of extraordinary universality developing

101
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.150 
and even more so, if you look at something like growth rate,

102
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.090 
this is for plants going from the tiniest

103
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.960 
almost bacterial like

104
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.190 
objects all the way up to the giant sequoias and redwoods and you

105
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.330 
can see it's totally systematic and the slope of that as you

106
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.310 
can see at the top here is very close. That's what this is, the slope

107
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.010 
is very close to this three quarters again.

108
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.760 
And here's something that is to consider yourself your brain

109
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.130 
your white to gray matter in your brain, the

110
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.640 
computational part versus just the the supply system

111
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.210 
and what you see is again extraordinary simple scaling and

112
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.160 
the slope of that is five quarters and lastly and the last

113
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.330 
one I'm going to show is genome length versus slide and that has a slope

114
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:12.030 
very close to one quarter and so we have these extraordinary universal behavior

115
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.880 
that everything seems to scale an extraordinary simple way. Furthermore

116
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.970 
there's a universality that everything is sort of governed

117
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.980 
by this number one quarter, the number four plays an extraordinarily central role

118
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.610 
in the whole biosphere around us and of course the question is -

119
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.070 
where the hell does that come from, why is that,

120
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.990 
where do these scaling laws come from and where does that number four come from?

121
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:46.180 
And the answer is it comes from the universal generic mathematical and physical properties

122
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.040 
of the multiple networks that support life.

123
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.560 
And there you are in the middle, but you're full of networks all

124
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.150 
of you is network so we met that you may identify that with

125
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.290 
yourself in the middle but these other things you know your bangs

126
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.930 
that you're inside your cel,l that's inside your mitochondria,

127
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.220 
there's a tree that doesn't look so different as your brain.

128
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.810 
But it's true across all of life, it's all networks and the mathematics

129
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.870 
and the generic principles of the networks of these

130
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.910 
of these multiple systems is what leads to these scaling laws.

131
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.130 
They have these kind of fractal self-similar properties that

132
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:33.510 
propagate throughout the system and one of the major inputs to the mathematics

133
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.740 
is something that's extremely a strong assumption but extremely

134
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.680 
important and that is the process of natural selection and

135
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.860 
adaptability has led to a kind of optimization of the system. So for example

136
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.610 
the circulatory system that all of us share not only all of us, all

137
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.730 
human beings, but all mammals all mammals live have lived share is that

138
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:03.310 
it is evolved so that the work done by your heart to pump blood through to yourselves

139
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.760 
is minimized. That is you change any aspect of the system and

140
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.420 
you would have your heart would have to work harder. We live

141
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.010 
in this sort of basin of optimization and

142
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.140 
and driven by natural selection, because you want to minimize the

143
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.920 
amount of energy and

144
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.690 
food that you put into the mundane

145
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.440 
problem of staying alive, so that you maximize the amount of

146
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.820 
energy you put into sex and reproduction and the raising of

147
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.570 
children to propagate your genes. So that's sort of the idea

148
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.160 
the idea of maximizing darwinian fitness.

149
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.230 
So one of the things that comes out of this also is that lifespan

150
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.090 
scales in a systematic way and I've written it mathematically

151
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.810 
that I thought I'd put one teeny little bit of mathematics in.

152
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.930 
That quarter this means the slope of the curve so if I showed you life

153
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.300 
span versus weight it would have a slope of plus one quarter.

154
00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.370 
And life span increases with size precisely because

155
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.250 
the bigger you are, more efficient yourselves also your cells

156
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.560 
have to do. Less energy is less wear and tear so you live longer

157
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.070 
in a systematic way and that one quarter propagates its way through.

158
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.890 
On the other hand your heart rate has been going down systematically with the same

159
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.430 
exponent the same one quarter so if you multiply the two together,

160
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.220 
one cancels the other. So heart rate time lifespan is the same for everybody.

161
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.010 
But what is lifetime times heart rate? That is the number of

162
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.100 
heartbeats in a lifetime. So you have this extraordinary

163
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.840 
prediction that the total number of heartbeats in a lifetime

164
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.290 
is the same for everybody and there is the graph going from a little

165
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.680 
animals to the blue whale and it's pretty much you see the constancy.

166
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.920 
So if you look in the same way if you look through the same

167
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.640 
lens, everybody is sort of living at the same rate

168
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.330 
in terms of biological time.

169
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.610 
So I want to move I'm going to do one last thing biology before

170
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.470 
moving to a social systems.

171
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.660 
I want to talk about growth because that's fundamental and we've all done it

172
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.380 
and that means we've all scaled and we've all adapted to those

173
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.050 
different scales as we've grown and we've done it of course we've

174
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.410 
driven our growth is by each thing is by metabolizing and

175
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.550 
that metabolic energy roughly speaking gets apportioned between maintaining the system,

176
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.340 
that is repairing cells, replacing ones that have died and growing

177
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.900 
new ones that I've written it down in english,

178
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.210 
but you put the whole distance in mathematics and to use that

179
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.610 
network theory that I alluded to, I'm obviously not showing

180
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.510 
any of the technicalities and from that you can derive

181
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.410 
the growth curve. And here it is for us actually for a rat.

182
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:52.140 
And that solid line is a prediction and those points are the data

183
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:58.010 
and what you see is what you and I have gone through, then you grow quickly

184
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.860 
and then you stop. And the reason you stop is related to the fact

185
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.110 
that the scaling of metabolism which drives the system

186
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.480 
is sublinear it was three quarters, less than one, and it turns

187
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.860 
out that leads to bounded growth. So it sort of built into the system

188
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.210 
because of the efficiency of the networks that you're destined

189
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.250 
to stop growing growing and you're destined to have that kind

190
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.390 
of growth code that sigmoidal so-called sigmoidal growth code

191
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.640 
and that happens to be one of the best, right. That's why I'm showing

192
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.390 
it here but you can do it for all animals and I just show you

193
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.450 
a few of them and there's birds, fish and

194
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.830 
mammals here. But what is wonderful about it, it's a universal

195
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.790 
theory with universal parameters and you can rescale all of these

196
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.920 
in a certain way like I did life span. I'm not going to go into

197
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.710 
the details of this if you rescale both the weight at some age

198
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.990 
and you rescale the time, everybody appears to grow in the same way.

199
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.810 
So, and here's just the small something.

200
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.250 
So, to summarize this first bit,

201
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.730 
we have these extraordinary scaling laws, they're universal

202
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.370 
despite the extraordinary complexity and diversity,

203
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.140 
maybe the most complex and diverse system in the universe and life,

204
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.140 
and yet they satisfy these simple scaling laws, they express

205
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.770 
a certain economy of scale, the bigger you are the less you

206
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.450 
need per cell to stay alive, the pace of life I didn't say this but was implicit,

207
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:35.040 
the pace of life slows down. So you live longer heart rates go slower,

208
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:40.430 
everything goes slower but in a systematic way you grow quickly and then stop

209
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.460 
and then you die. And the theory predicts that and all of that

210
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.360 
is embodied in the mathematics and physics of the networks

211
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.050 
and I want to take this picture over to social organizations

212
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.670 
but I'm going to do it with a hint by being motivated by thinking

213
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.910 
about the future of the planet because this is the way I think

214
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.840 
about the planet. The planet is not just this you know the geographical

215
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.180 
thing you're used to, but of course it's covered with

216
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.160 
buildings and people and cities and we dominated and I just

217
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.670 
want to show you whimsically a picture that you probably can barely see

218
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:21.880 
which is what I estimate is a picture taken by a NASA satellite

219
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.900 
in the year I was born, nineteen forty, and compare it to what it is today.

220
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.510 
And of course you are very familiar with this what has happened

221
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.890 
is the earth has burnt up. I mean that what is what is there

222
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.480 
is all that is cities and it's all the use of electricity with

223
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.030 
burnt from fossil fuel to promote that and that has been happening

224
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.570 
for the last two hundred years. And it's been unbelievably successful and brought us

225
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.740 
to be able to do the kinds of things we do today. But it has

226
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.200 
horrible consequences and I want to talk about that in the context of scale.

227
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.850 
So and I want to give you some sense of the scale of it all

228
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.130 
and you're familiar with this if not not in detail, but you are

229
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.570 
in spirit you know I'm just going to in terms of the US. The

230
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:14.440 
US was overwhelmingly non-urban when it was founded two hundred

231
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.020 
or so years ago. It's now almost entirely urbanized,

232
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.610 
it's over eighty percent urbanized, the world is more than half urbanized now

233
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.990 
and it's moving towards the seventy eighty percent towards

234
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.830 
the second half of the century. And just to give you a sense

235
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.320 
of the rate at which it's happening, and this feeds into I think

236
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.660 
what you should be thinking of in terms of education, and that

237
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.740 
is that this we are urbanizing over a million people every

238
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.320 
week. It's more like one and a half million which means we're

239
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.560 
adding a New York metropolitan area every few months and we're

240
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.470 
adding a potsdam every day. So that's what's happening and it's extraordinary

241
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.750 
and the pressures are fantastic. So we need to understand a

242
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.630 
little bit about cities and I want to do it again as I say

243
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.690 
in the context of scale. And here's what a city looks like of course.

244
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.550 
A typical city buildings and roads and infrastructure in general

245
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.810 
and this is the way we normally think about it. But in fact

246
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.320 
this is the uninteresting part of the city in a sense because

247
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.550 
the only reason it's there is in order to support this, to support social interactions,

248
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.270 
social networking, to support

249
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.780 
the creation of ideas, innovation, creation of wealth, in order to

250
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.380 
increase standards of quality of life. That's what cities are therefore

251
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.030 
again they have been enormously successful and great cities

252
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.780 
have places like this in order to facilitate both formal and

253
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.780 
informal gatherings. They have university lecture halls and stadiums

254
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.740 
and gathering places like this and coffee houses and that is

255
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.040 
crucial and that is the lifeblood of a city.

256
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:51.540 
So this is this extraordinary machine that we have evolved

257
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.600 
in order to create wealth, knowledge, innovation ideas, to increase

258
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.380 
standards of quality of life for everybody. That's the idea and

259
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.010 
may I say education is a fundamental and crucial aspect of that.

260
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.210 
But of course you know this has unintended consequences and

261
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.740 
the most fundamental law of science is the second law of thermodynamics

262
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.330 
which says, if you use energy like we've just talked about,

263
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.580 
to create great order, then you inevitably have to create along

264
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.910 
with it disorder and that's called entropy and inevitably the

265
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.800 
marvelous things that we do with cities also creates both physical

266
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.350 
and social entropy, all of which you're used to,

267
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:37.390 
all of these things are integral in one way or another at least in spirit

268
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.170 
to what modern life is like and

269
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.280 
everything from pollution,

270
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.420 
disease, crime, creating terrible conditions for some people to live in,

271
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.760 
disease, pandemics, we're going through one now, and of course social unrest.

272
00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:02.260 
And that is just it may not be these specific things but it

273
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.620 
is inevitable that we create something like this and

274
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.080 
the challenge is to minimize that and mitigate the problems that we create

275
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.740 
and again just to repeat the obvious, education is a crucial component of that.

276
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.260 
And of course the destruction of the

277
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.660 
biosphere and the environment.

278
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.350 
So, and of course, by the way,

279
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.520 
the climate change of course is coming from out of this. Just one of many

280
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.920 
and one of most important but it's only one of many and I

281
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.930 
want to emphasize that I think it's a mistake

282
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.490 
only to focus on climate change as a product of what we've been doing.

283
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.820 
So, from a scientific viewpoint, cities are what we call complex

284
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.020 
adaptive system. They're obviously complex, they have huge numbers of components,

285
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.470 
they have different scales, they have emergent behavior, they

286
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.630 
are continually adapting and evolving but they have two major

287
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.640 
components. One is I've just shown you. On that one hand the

288
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.960 
infrastructure, the physicality, its metabolism if you like

289
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.820 
and the other is the exchange of information, creating wealth and so on.

290
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:18.120 
That said, and we integrate these and both of these are derived from networks.

291
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.780 
One the obvious one the networks of the physical system but

292
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.710 
also social networks. I'm first going to talk about the physical.

293
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.690 
We are all familiar with this, all the roads, transport and the

294
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:34.110 
electrical lines and so on. It supports supplied by networks and

295
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.640 
these networks have this sort of fractal like quality. This is the

296
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.880 
road traffic out of Laredo, Texas, just arbitrarily chosen and

297
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.280 
it's not the roads, but it's the road traffic and if you said

298
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.020 
the roads would look very

299
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:53.580 
rectangular but the traffic is very fractal like and it looks

300
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.640 
just like the inside of you and me and in fact it is just like

301
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.460 
the inside of you and me, except it's two dimensional rather than three.

302
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.610 
So, it turns out because of that the same kind of ideas of optimization

303
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.620 
and networks and so on, the mathematics leads to the prediction

304
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.330 
that there should be scaling laws specific

305
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.780 
for the infrastructure and indeed there is. This is a mundane one -

306
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.910 
petrol stations versus population, and you can see they scale

307
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.570 
for these four European cities but what's amazing

308
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.810 
is that this is true across the entire globe and they all have

309
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.280 
roughly speaking the same slope. The slope of the previous ones

310
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.440 
for one quarter, the slopes here are not three quarters, it's

311
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.230 
more like point eight five. So, there's an economy of scale - the

312
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.870 
bigger you are, you need less gas stations per capita. But you

313
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.290 
save about fifteen percent with each doubling. So you have the

314
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.530 
same kind of phenomenon but what is amazing it's not just gas

315
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.010 
stations, it turns out it's for all infrastructure,

316
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.960 
whether it's electrical lines, road lines, buildings, etcetera

317
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.510 
etcetera. And it's true across the globe with the same scaling

318
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.590 
or so there's this kind of universality

319
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.950 
that is mimicking what went on in biology and I you see at

320
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.100 
the top there I consider those laws hidden laws of biology

321
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.470 
and these are kind of the hidden laws of cities, the things

322
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.770 
that you're not aware of because it looks like some random mess out there,

323
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.750 
but in fact there's extraordinary structure and systematic behavior

324
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:24.310 
going on underneath the mess. And, but you know what I said earlier,

325
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.940 
that's not the interesting part of the city really. This part of the city

326
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.310 
is what we're doing now, except we're doing it

327
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.390 
electronically and I'll come to that in a moment, but here is the

328
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.110 
social networks, is the interaction between people, the nodes

329
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.670 
here are people. Of course the lines are the connections to

330
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.430 
the friends and colleagues others and so on and

331
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.720 
so this has a very different quality to it than

332
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.650 
the infrastructural networks I've been talking about in biology and the cities

333
00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.660 
and one of the things that it has that is different is and

334
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.280 
it's not shown here, is that first of all, everybody has to be

335
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.480 
somewhere. So despite the idea that

336
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.130 
networks are somehow up in cyberspace in the cloud, they are

337
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.070 
not because each person has to be somewhere, even though where

338
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.120 
I'm talking to you on xoom across the several thousand miles,

339
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:24.510 
I'm sitting at my desk in my office looking out of the window

340
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.950 
and you're sitting in various, but you have to be somewhere

341
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.220 
and that means you're tied to the infrastructure

342
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.120 
and not only that, you have to be moving sometimes. You have

343
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.040 
to take the kids to school, you have to go to the office, you

344
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.610 
have to go to the theater and so on and so forth. Secondly, there's modularity.

345
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.520 
We have families, we have groups who have divisions and so forth.

346
00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.330 
We divide ourselves in various ways and that too has a systematic

347
00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:55.660 
behaviour. So you have to take all of that and you can put that into the theoretical framework

348
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.500 
and recognize that what you're doing, that picture in the middle

349
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.690 
is a combination of all these things and one of the things

350
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.710 
that's going on in the middle is what we all participate in

351
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.160 
and that is the positive feedback of social interactions. A

352
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.420 
talks to B, who talks to C, who talks back to A and we build

353
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.190 
on ideas continuously. We're doing that all the time. Almost

354
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.350 
all of those ideas are completely pointless and useless to everybody else.

355
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.970 
But what is extraordinary is that every once in a while these that

356
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.690 
phenomenon that is illustrated here leads to the theory of relativity

357
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:39.110 
or the invention of the internet or Amazon or Google or Toyota.

358
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.340 
That's how it comes about from this and that's what education

359
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.930 
is trying to formalize.

360
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.650 
Again, so, that's what I said and this has a very different implication

361
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.770 
because instead of sublinear scaling the bigger you are the less the capita

362
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.170 
positive feedback building on things means the bigger you are

363
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.020 
the more per capita and instead of the slowing of the pace of life,

364
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.510 
everything gets faster and I want to show you the data. It's just

365
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.310 
the sampling of half a dozen of hundreds of these damn things

366
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.810 
of the scalings, of various things in different parts of the world

367
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.390 
as wages, patterns you see now see there is plants ideas

368
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.810 
and a restaurant all kinds of things in different parts. I could

369
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.540 
show you many more, but what you see is, first of all there is

370
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.780 
scaling to varying degrees. But it's all the same. It's even

371
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.530 
though they're very different things look crime in japan

372
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.770 
and patents in the US scale in the same way. Why? Because they're all derived

373
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.480 
from social interactions.

374
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:43.650 
So that's kind of extraordinary and what it says in english, I decided that

375
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.090 
I should emphasize this by putting it into english,

376
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.300 
it's that the good bad and the ugly all come together, namely

377
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.680 
if you double the size of a city roughly speaking it within an urban system

378
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.960 
then systematically you save about fifteen percent on all the

379
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.140 
infrastructure which I emphasized and you increase all the

380
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.250 
socio economic activity - income, wealth, ideas, colleges,

381
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.810 
police, crime, flu and pandemic

382
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.120 
all by about fifteen percent. And here's the point -

383
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.770 
if you take those scaling laws and you can do the analysis

384
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:26.870 
I'm not showing it obviously, it has incredible implications for the pandemic

385
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.050 
a city of ten million will have double the number of COVID cases

386
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.080 
in half the time a city of one hundred thousand will and it'll

387
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.700 
have two hundred times as many even though it's only one hundred times as big.

388
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:43.190 
So very bad to be in a city during a pandemic, but very good

389
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:48.290 
if it's not in a pandemic, if you want greater buzz, greater activity,

390
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.960 
more opportunities, better education, high wages

391
00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.310 
etcetera etcetera. But the bad comes with the good.

392
00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.850 
Okay, and just to show you

393
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:05.020 
that I'm bringing back the graph. Here is a measure of social

394
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.460 
interaction and it's been done by taking billions and billions

395
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.040 
of cell phone calls and analyzing them to look at the connectivity between people

396
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:18.450 
and to plot that connection versus city size and the two colors there represent

397
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.490 
the United Kingdom and Portugal just taken arbitrarily and

398
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.490 
you can see the slope of them follows these other things

399
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.360 
strongly suggesting that indeed underlying this universality is in fact

400
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.580 
the dynamics of social networks and one of the big questions

401
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.680 
which is what your meeting is about

402
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.230 
in a certain sense is, what is this going to do to this soulless

403
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.040 
weird way in which we're interacting

404
00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:50.560 
via the internet on zoom, which I find extremely difficult by the way.

405
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:55.870 
But is obviously part of the wave of the future and it saved us, it's extraordinary.

406
00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.220 
But what is it going to do because we're no longer even though

407
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.530 
we're tied to infrastructure it's different and the question

408
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:06.630 
is, is it going to be different and I'm not sure it is. And I

409
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.490 
want to show you two pieces of data.

410
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:15.050 
One is the total number of comments versus the number of stock reddit users.

411
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.080 
You see the top left there and the bottom is

412
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.350 
the number of edits on wikipedia vs is the number of articles

413
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.640 
is just arbitrarily chose metric and you can see that both, I didn't,

414
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.010 
they both are super linear and they

415
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.140 
and they scale with this famous one point one five. So the question

416
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.330 
is, maybe it isn't going to be so different in some way that's

417
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:43.310 
yet to be analyzed. There's abundant work done on this and that's a fundamental question

418
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:47.340 
but my own intuition, I've switched back and forth on this, has

419
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.940 
gone from saying, a, it's going to be revolutionary

420
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.510 
and not it's obvious is revolution in one way but it's going

421
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.880 
to really change some of the fundamentals. I don't believe it is.

422
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.560 
I now believe that it's the only thing that's

423
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.210 
going to change is whatever every major innovations that were

424
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.930 
done in the past increase the pace of life and I want to come to that

425
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.950 
in a while. I'm going to finish off with talking about growth

426
00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.700 
in social systems and you have to introduce something called social metabolic rate.

427
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.360 
That's all the stuff that goes into producing ideas and buildings

428
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.240 
and everything. So everything sort of goes in there and that

429
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.580 
goes to maintaining all of that stuff, which means repairing

430
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:31.150 
roads and buildings, repairing people, your doctors and hospitals and so on

431
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.970 
and then you add new stuff. You start developing different areas,

432
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.380 
you grow new people, they come in by

433
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.390 
immigration and so on. So you have to write well this is rather complicated

434
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.250 
but you can analyze this and use the scaling laws and out of that,

435
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.430 
you get something extremely interesting,

436
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:53.980 
namely that the growth instead of being a sort of stopping

437
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.780 
after a time by, we do stop growing we actually have open ended

438
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.080 
growth, which is what we see.

439
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.070 
So that's great. So we have a very nice

440
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:09.780 
sort of a theoretical package. We have networks with superlinear scaling

441
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.830 
giving rise to the superlinear scaling, the bigger you are

442
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.620 
the more you get per capita and that leads to open ended growth

443
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.820 
which is what we see. I don't have time to save the

444
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.820 
graphs. I don't think I included them but it has some interesting

445
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.510 
consequences and that is that's indicated by that dotted line.

446
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:35.370 
It has built into it something that we call a finite time singularity and that singularity

447
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:40.370 
bodes ill because what it says is that in some finite time

448
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.110 
if you keep going you would have this, this curve would become

449
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.690 
infinite which is crazy. You can't have an infinite GDP, you can't have

450
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.640 
an infinite number, you can't have an infinite number of patents,

451
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.230 
you can't have an infinite number of aged cases and so on. And

452
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.980 
the theory tells you what happens - the system collapses.

453
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.370 
And so the question is, how do you get out of this. And you recognize

454
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.620 
the way you get out of it is by innovation. This goes back to

455
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.540 
the beginning of the talk because you have to change something

456
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.170 
as the limit to growth, go into this but you can get out

457
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.410 
of it by changing something and you recognize that that growth on the left

458
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:22.000 
and the way we grow is usually within is always within some major paradigm.

459
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.690 
You discover bronze, discover iron, you discover coal,

460
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.330 
you invent the computer, you invent the internet, something that

461
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:35.340 
sort of sets the tone of the age that we're in. So the idea

462
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.210 
is this is a cartoon version, you grow you would collapse. Somewhere

463
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:43.060 
along the line you better make another major innovation and

464
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.460 
then you start off again and you would collapse again and you

465
00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.580 
have to keep doing this over and over again. So if you want open ended growth.

466
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.780 
You want to keep increasing the scale, then you have to have

467
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:59.670 
continuous cycles of innovation to avoid collapse but the crucial thing is

468
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:04.070 
they have to come faster and faster in a systematic predictable way.

469
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.650 
It has to be an accelerating system in order to stay so to speak

470
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.070 
ahead of the curve. So the idea which is inherent in all economics

471
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.640 
that you shouldn't worry too much about

472
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:21.140 
population growth, Malthusian problems and so forth that collapse

473
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.280 
won't happen because we innovate our way out of it. Yes, you can innovate

474
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.380 
but it only postpones because it has to come again, because

475
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.340 
what has been neglected is that the system speeds up. And here

476
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.660 
this is not mine, I don't know who this guy is but

477
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.310 
it looks like my work.

478
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.190 
But what you see here is innovations on a small scale

479
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.370 
I mean various things we're familiar with and the numbers in

480
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.410 
brackets are how long it took to reach ten million customers, a proxy for

481
00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.540 
the speed and what you see it gets faster and

482
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.920 
those numbers get smaller and smaller, things get faster and faster

483
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.620 
and if you plot those, they fit exactly what was predicted by this theory

484
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:06.290 
and here's a much bigger picture. That's not my work either is

485
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.670 
this is paradigm what's been called paradigm shifts but is

486
00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:13.450 
how long ago they happened. So on the y axis is

487
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.190 
how long it took to make

488
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:21.910 
it. So it took a billion years for cells to develop and it happened

489
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.420 
if you look down half a billion years ago all the way down to the internet

490
00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.300 
which happened just, you know, sort of twenty thirty years ago

491
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:32.050 
and took twenty years to develop. And that line

492
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.300 
is the line from the theory and it's plotted you see logarithmically. Okay.

493
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.890 
So just to repeat what I said, you have this unbounded growth, you have this

494
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.590 
this finite time singularity, innovations have to come faster

495
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.700 
and faster. So you have to do things faster and faster as you address

496
00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.860 
the various questions and it's the example of the continuous acceleration

497
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:57.080 
of socio-economic life and here's the take home message. That means

498
00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.880 
that we have to adapt faster and faster, yet,

499
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:04.630 
we have the same brain biology we had one hundred thousand years ago.

500
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:10.270 
And that I believe is becoming a bigger and bigger issue and

501
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:14.380 
that is the challenge of education as far as I'm concerned is adapting

502
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.170 
the educational system to the fact that we have the same brain

503
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.870 
which is an adaptable brain, obviously it's amazing, I'm eighty years old

504
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.950 
and I still have to learn how to do all these stupid things

505
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:29.760 
on the internet and all my young twenty five year old colleagues

506
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.310 
giving me new things I have to learn. It's quite challenging

507
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.700 
but I can do that and people do adapt but it's getting faster and faster

508
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.920 
and I think that's the thing that we have to challenge. So the

509
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.340 
question is is that sustainable. And I'm going to finish up with very quickly

510
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.650 
with just work that we've been doing on universities. It turns

511
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.010 
out you can ask the universities in scale. We've already done it

512
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.980 
for US universities. There are six thousand colleges and universities

513
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.650 
in the United States, that's all of them.

514
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.140 
And this is their revenue and expenditures and there's quite

515
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:05.510 
a bit of spread and actually the overall mean they scale linearly.

516
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.100 
So there's that would suggest there's no advantage to scale

517
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.400 
but in fact it's very this is misleading use of scaling because

518
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.310 
these different universités different categories of universities and

519
00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:22.460 
here they are. There's roughly seven. Everything from fancy big

520
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:27.310 
public research universities like Michigan or private ones like Harvard

521
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:31.300 
all the way down to little for-profit colleges or professional

522
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:36.050 
schools and they scale differently. And the great use of scaling for this

523
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:41.070 
is that some scale in terms of these super-duper lineally, look at

524
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:46.130 
private research universities, but if you look down here,

525
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:51.010 
community colleges they scale some linearly. So they're delivering much more

526
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.990 
to students, the community colleges than the the Harvards, who

527
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.580 
are not delivering to the students that you're costing more

528
00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.430 
more the bigger you are. But of course you're putting money

529
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.310 
into research and so on. So it depends on functionality and

530
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.300 
so on. So there's a whole bunch of questions there.

531
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.580 
So I'll finish that and I'm just going to leave you with a

532
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.810 
couple of scaling things. One is, I didn't say it but on that

533
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:16.260 
graph of metabolic rate if you looked across you will see that

534
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.490 
your metabolic rate listening to me is about one hundred watts.

535
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.060 
You're like a old-fashioned incandescent light bulb.

536
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.590 
That's how much food you eat everyday, two thousand food calories.

537
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.630 
You are extraordinarily efficien. Oon the other hand your social

538
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.500 
metabolic rate at least in the United States how much energy

539
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.820 
I need to stay alive to the standard and quality of life I have

540
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:44.130 
having a car, refrigerator, airconditioning or heating or whatever

541
00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:48.180 
I need eleven thousand. I'm a hundred times bigger than

542
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:53.090 
what I should be and that gets reflected in this there's that hundred watts here

543
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.090 
as you look across but here's what's happened to us. We've gone way up

544
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.680 
and we're way off scale and that's why we are destroying the planet, of course.

545
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.300 
We're completely disrupted

546
00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.660 
because we have co-evolved with all of the organisms on the planet

547
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.960 
so that we have the right metabolic rate, we have the right

548
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.810 
length of the aorta, we have the right diffusion rate across cells

549
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.500 
and so on. We live the right length of time and so on and so forth.

550
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:25.570 
And just to put that in perspective that eleven thousand watts

551
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.460 
if you turn it around in how big an animal are each of

552
00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.680 
us acting as, it's about thirty thousand kilograms or about a dozen elephants.

553
00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.900 
So I finished there and thank you very much and I'm sorry I

554
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.270 
probably went way over time

555
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.630 
but I'm happy to answer any questions if there are any.

556
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.850 
So if you have questions.

557
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.600 
Thanks, thanks a lot Geoffrey.

558
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.700 
It was a very inspiring talk.

559
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.240 
So if there are any questions in the audience, I would

560
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.930 
ask yes raise your hands and I will.

561
00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:17.450 
Thomas, I think there is a question in the questionnaire.

562
00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.430 
Okay, let me see.

563
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.550 
Geoffrey, that was a great talk. Thank you very much and I'm

564
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.550 
a good ways through your book which I'm really enjoying.

565
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.760 
I have a question, perhaps to stretch your mind.

566
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:45.060 
I'm wondering if you think it's possible that human learning is rate limited

567
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.970 
and as some background we've been

568
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.690 
accumulating data across multiple academic settings and

569
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.250 
mapping out learning curves and fitting functions to them and

570
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.730 
those curves vary by the kinds of knowledge being acquired but

571
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.070 
they're surprisingly similar across students and it's

572
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.700 
made me wonder whether there might be a

573
00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.120 
derivable limit to the rate at which humans learn.

574
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.900 
Yes, I guess that's a very challenging

575
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.370 
question and I don't know of course the answer to that.

576
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:23.170 
And you know I sort was touching on that towards the end

577
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.290 
of the talk of course.

578
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.220 
The question of what are the limits to human capability of adapting

579
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:34.010 
and I think the adaptation that's why I brought up

580
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:39.320 
this time, this accelerating time, because it may well be the

581
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.860 
given, you know, so I would say infinite time, very long time periods.

582
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:49.230 
We might be, you know, very obviously, very slowly adaptable, obviously, otherwise we

583
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.120 
shouldn't work but it's that we've created the social time

584
00:39:54.670 --> 00:40:00.910 
and social time is accelerating. So it may be that we can't adapt fast enough

585
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.590 
to accommodate to the increasing rate of social time. That's

586
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.850 
I think is the big issue as far as I'm concerned. Now

587
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:14.090 
the counter to that is this is the kind of obvious one that

588
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:17.360 
one of the things that we have done is

589
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.100 
invented all these accessory things. Like, you know, I have in

590
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.450 
front of me my computer, Google and so on which means I don't

591
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.380 
have to remember all these things in my head

592
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.110 
and so on and so forth. And

593
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.810 
you know, and that is of course the extension of human intelligence

594
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.010 
and then it becomes then there's things like

595
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.380 
AI and machine learning and you know, how does that

596
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.680 
integrate with our human brain and so on and cyborgs and all

597
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.580 
the rest of that kind of science fiction stuff. And maybe that

598
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.690 
will come to pass and maybe that is what is going to happen

599
00:40:54.690 --> 00:41:00.090 
in order to overcome this extraordinary challenge. I do have one side comment

600
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.180 
which illustrates my sort of Victorian conservativism about education

601
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:10.830 
and that is that one of the things that I work with mostly young people

602
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:15.890 
and one of the things I've become striked by

603
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:20.100 
over you know sixty years doing research as distinct from young

604
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:25.350 
people, say thirty forty years ago, is that to put it in cartoon terms

605
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.120 
these people now don't know the times table,

606
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:33.660 
namely, the various fundamental things that you should know

607
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.250 
in order to think big are

608
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:41.380 
often missing because they've relied on Google to do it for them.

609
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:46.350 
And that's fine, that may well be fine but it bothers me that

610
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:50.190 
learning fundamentals of your discipline or whatever it is

611
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.500 
or in school learning some of the fundamentals

612
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:57.130 
creates a way of thinking and a way of understanding that

613
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:02.650 
then transmits into other things. Now I'm not an educator this is purely anecdotal

614
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.590 
but that's that's one of my concerns that I see around me as

615
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.960 
I watch you know the group of people I work with.

616
00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:16.320 
But you know, going back to your question, I think it's a fascinating question

617
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.550 
and I'd love to see data on that. I'm quite intrigued, we've

618
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.470 
done this work on universities which is you know not really

619
00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:27.550 
doesn't directly address it. But we have started thinking

620
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.510 
about these kinds of questions and indeed the big question

621
00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.200 
of the future of universities.

622
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.580 
I'll send you some pointers today. Could you? I'd be very interested actually.

623
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:38.980 
Thank you.

624
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:47.880 
So do we have more questions? I think we have time for one or two

625
00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:53.540 
more questions. It's just a race here. We have a question here.

626
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:58.740 
Thank you. Great talk. I was just wondering

627
00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:04.720 
a bit about the following up on kids and on the role of technology

628
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:10.630 
and if in the different, I mean, you show different distributions for

629
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:14.630 
different kinds of beings, different types of cycles and these

630
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:20.960 
distributions and relations. I was wondering if this also could

631
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.370 
be used to, so to say, to identify healthy

632
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.620 
in quotation marks, healthy

633
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:35.330 
technologies that scale according to these laws and others that don't.

634
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.420 
Boy, that's a tough question.

635
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:45.210 
Yes, I don't know whether one could actually say one could identify

636
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.040 
healthy technologies

637
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:54.020 
but it is certainly true that you can use these scaling laws

638
00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:03.010 
in ways that, how shall I say, rank things in various ways.

639
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.150 
So everything from what are called learning curves

640
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:12.280 
that is that you know traditionally in engineering a learning curve

641
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.350 
is that you know the more you produce the cheaper it is in

642
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:19.340 
sort of a rough, I mean, a simplistic way of saying it.

643
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:25.190 
And I have done a little bit of work on that and it's surprising

644
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:30.820 
that without naming names of major industries where they violate

645
00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.900 
that, they don't even realize that they're violating the kind of

646
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:38.110 
idealized learning curve and

647
00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:44.170 
so you can use those but the other way of using scaling, which

648
00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:49.360 
isn't directly answering your question, is to recognize that the scaling

649
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:55.300 
is the only sort to buy into the conceptual framework that the

650
00:44:55.510 --> 00:45:01.990 
scaling line represents something is being optimized and represents

651
00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.700 
something that has happened if you like because of the various

652
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.720 
pressures, evolutionary pressures, survival of the fittest, whatever the system is

653
00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.250 
in some form or another. And so deviations from it, everything

654
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:19.340 
everyone deviates from it and so the deviation from it either

655
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.680 
up or down on various metrics gives you a performance metric.

656
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:29.990 
And we have done that for various, we've done that mostly for cities, actually.

657
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.170 
And where you can

658
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:37.740 
you plot that deviation and you see that some cities

659
00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:42.430 
are over performing in the sense that maybe they create more patents.

660
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:46.800 
They have less crime than they should, in quotes, for their

661
00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:52.020 
signs. Or to put it slightly differently, you know if a mayor, if someone

662
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:57.910 
is the mayor of a city for five years and he says well, you know, we decrease

663
00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:01.910 
crime by a certain amount but the city grew by a certain amount.

664
00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:05.920 
It was in a sense, you know, you could interpret this and say

665
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.380 
well you sort of guaranteed that the crime was going to decrease by that amount.

666
00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.010 
Did you over perform on that? Did you decrease more than that?

667
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:19.630 
So there are ways in which you can use these and we have used them fruitfully actually

668
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.800 
for trying to

669
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:27.020 
understand high performance versus low performance because

670
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.950 
and by the way this is in contrast to the canonical way of doing it

671
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.790 
which is where you only use per capita indices.

672
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.150 
That is, you simply say, you know,

673
00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:44.980 
per capita New York produces more of x than Santa Fe, where

674
00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.610 
I live. Well you have to read, I mean, there's a dynamic that was inevitable.

675
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:54.260 
So what you'd like to see in some cases did leadership play a role.

676
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.840 
So going back to what I said, did leadership play a role or

677
00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:01.500 
and so you could imagine doing this going back to your original question

678
00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:05.520 
with various inventions or innovations in

679
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.490 
seeing that because no invention comes out of the blue. It's always

680
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:15.250 
related to something previous and I have old postdocs

681
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:19.240 
and colleagues that should work on this the try to look at that

682
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:25.820 
to see how new inventions are built from old ones and how they scale.

683
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:31.130 
And now, what is interesting here is they do not make a judgment

684
00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.050 
but it would be interesting to think in terms of judgment actually. I mean,

685
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.420 
in terms of performance. So I think it's a very

686
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.070 
good question.

687
00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:59.350 
I see a couple of questions. I didn't realize it was a

688
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.110 
QnA thing. I apologize,

689
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.330 
but someone, Dori

690
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:10.170 
asked has our metabolic rate changed with the ages through ages.

691
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:16.090 
Well our biological metabolic rate is almost certainly the same

692
00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.860 
as it was when we were hunter-gatherers.

693
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:24.660 
I think it's this ninety to a hundred watts on the average

694
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.830 
that's been there since we identified as homo sapiens.

695
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.410 
What has changed dramatically is the soial metabolic rate and that's the point

696
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:38.000 
that you know they're still a hunter-gatherers on the planet

697
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:42.620 
and you know, if hunter-gatherers, if you add in

698
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:49.120 
the kind of kinetic energy of moving, you have to hunt and gather

699
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:50.880 
you have to walk around, you have to do things

700
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.500 
that hundred watts goes to somewhere between two and three

701
00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.530 
hundred watts. You sort of double it in terms of the energy

702
00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:00.610 
you actually used to wander around and do things.

703
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:05.520 
And there are still people on this planet who live at that

704
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.860 
level, at that scale of about three hundred watts

705
00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:14.650 
whereas I apparently live at about eleven thousand watts and

706
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:18.310 
it's that eleven thousand watts that of course is leading us

707
00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:23.500 
to the kind of ecological environmental sustainability crisis that we're

708
00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.360 
facing.

709
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.990 
Someone else about that, and you know maybe we're not in such

710
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:44.000 
bad shape in terms of energy and you know that's a big question.

711
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.050 
I mean brings up

712
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:51.170 
questions of you know you could use nuclear energy and so forth.

713
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.240 
Of course that's true,

714
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.840 
but I'm more concerned

715
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.930 
interestingly I think that isn't. I do think energy is an issue

716
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:03.840 
I think we won't but we can potentially solve, it is no question. By

717
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.310 
probably renewables even we could do it if we have the will

718
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:15.630 
but I'm much more concerned about this intrinsic dynamic of our social structures,

719
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:18.060 
that our social structures

720
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:26.020 
lead to the increasing pace of life and that identification of paradigm shifts

721
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.250 
and in particular

722
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.490 
major innovations is always in technological terms

723
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:39.250 
and in fact so much so in the last twenty years the word innovation

724
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:44.500 
has become identified with technology and I think it's

725
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.360 
time to think about major paradigm shifts as being social.

726
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.960 
And we have to change something in our social networks, in our cultures

727
00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:56.130 
and so on and suddenly you know things like the green movement

728
00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:01.950 
are some sort of small attempt to do some of that in some limited area.

729
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:07.230 
But we probably need major changes and that's why some, you know, what

730
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:11.590 
an educational system is at the hub of that and how we

731
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.550 
how we deal with that and that of course is interestingly related

732
00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:18.040 
to our culture and so forth. So there are huge questions

733
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.230 
still on the one hand in answering this question from Mathias,

734
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:31.990 
in some physical sense, we're not in such a bad situation maybe,

735
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:34.710 
but I think in a social sense we are.

736
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.000 
I mean there are seven and half billion people on this planet

737
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.410 
and in a very few years, there'll be ten or eleven billion.

738
00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.650 
And you know we don't kind of recognize or just think of that

739
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:54.750 
Potsdam every day or being equivalent to that is happening every day.

740
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:59.180 
That's pretty amazing. Just the the infrastructure that you

741
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.460 
need even. If it's a crude infrastructure is fantastic

742
00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:06.590 
China is building you know two or three hundred new cities in the next

743
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:12.220 
ten fifteen years, each in excess of a million people. That's

744
00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.150 
going to affect everybody's life on the planet.

745
00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.240 
So we're building up to something.

746
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:22.570 
That's my concern and it comes from scale. I mean that's what's amazing.

747
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:26.280 
It's all in terms of thinking of scale and responding to scale.

748
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:35.750 
Thank you so much for the talking and all the interesting

749
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.880 
answers and discussions afterwards.

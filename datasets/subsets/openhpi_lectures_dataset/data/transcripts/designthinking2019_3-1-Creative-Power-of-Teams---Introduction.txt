00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.760 
So for this week,

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520 
we want to focus on teams and especially
on the creative power of teams.

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.240 
And we found out through the last 12 years
here at the School Design Thinking

4
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.560 
this is not an easy part, because
all of our students coming from all over

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.760 
the world from lots
of different disciplines

6
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.280 
they are coming up to us

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.160 
up to now in a highly individual

8
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.280 
competitive mode and not really
prepared to be team players.

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
Yeah, absolutely.
And then this also continues once they

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.200 
start entering the corporate world or
the professional world where they actually

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.760 
end up typically in a silo structure, where
they get individual incentives

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.600 
for individual great performances that
they individually report to their bosses.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.880 
And that was perfect in Brockhaus
times of the last century,

14
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.320 
Perfect,
Maybe 20 years ago.

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.440 
It was also somehow perfect because it was

16
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.920 
helping people to define their
career pathways and so on.

17
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.320 
And we were not having this capabilities
of collaboration, which we have right now.

18
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.360 
But now we have it.

19
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.200 
And now that is the big
part for the learning part.

20
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.560 
But also especially for organizations how

21
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.000 
to get people motivated to collaborate
and to be team players.

22
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.480 
Absolutely.
Because I said, if you remember the open

23
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.480 
networked organization we have been
creating, you have

24
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.440 
so many ties to other people,
to other teams,

25
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.720 
to other areas of the organization
that are actually sharing with you.

26
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.560 
And you also sharing with them information,
insights, but also knowledge.

27
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.120 
So therefore, in order to also establish

28
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.240 
that even more that openness, the team
approach, is really desperately needed.

29
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.480 
Yeah, and there's some other thing

30
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
to acknowledge,
the diversity of group of people.

31
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.440 
So to actually see there is a value

32
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.000 
in having people from very different
disciplines, maybe cultural backgrounds,

33
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.280 
different personalities to combine
their forces to solve complex problems.

34
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.320 
And we are not trained,

35
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.600 
to appreciate this.

36
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.920 
So now, Claudia, will dive deeper
into how we compose a team,

37
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
the team dynamics and also about

38
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.040 
team communication
and also share leadership.

39
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.520 
And then we're going to continue
with teams of teams.

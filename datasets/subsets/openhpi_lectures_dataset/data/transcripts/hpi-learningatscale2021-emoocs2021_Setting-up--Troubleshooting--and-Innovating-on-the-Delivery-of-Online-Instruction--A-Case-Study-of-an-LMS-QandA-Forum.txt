00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.190 
hi everyone, i'm Kavana Ramesh from the IS lab at the school

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.790 
of computing science at simon fraser university.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.940 
i'll be sharing with you some of our recent work on how instructors use

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.030 
their learning management systems for setting up troubleshooting

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.860 
and innovating on the delivery of online instruction.

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.190 
first i want to share with you some context about canvass,

7
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.880 
a learning management system or lms that's widely used globally

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
with four thousand institutions worldwide and
thirty million global users.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.250 
LMSs like canvas tend to have a wide range of features and

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850 
a steep learning curve for many instructors.

11
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.010 
this problem became even more difficult.
this past year as many

12
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.140 
instructors had to move their courses to fully online teaching

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.290 
on very short notice and often with very little support .

14
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.980 
popular lms is like canvas tend to have online help communities.

15
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.810 
like the canvas community forum which has five hundred thousand users.

16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.220 
and these are available for instructors to ask questions
about how to use

17
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.950 
different features or set up their courses. these communities

18
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.150 
can be a great tool to support instructors with LMS says especially

19
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.040 
as it's been harder for many instructors to access
and learn from their colleagues.

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.260 
however, we don't know much about how the

21
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.170 
LMS communities get used for troubleshooting and support learning.

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.750 
and we lack insights into what types of issues get discussed.

23
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.120 
and what extent instructors are able to find the relevant answers
they're looking for.

24
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.020 
to address this.
we want to look into the following question:

25
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.060 
how do instructors use these online community driven help forms

26
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.300 
to collaboratively learn and troubleshoot their LMS.

27
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.390 
our approach to this question was to first conduct a mixed methods

28
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.740 
content analysis of two hundred and fifty form posts,

29
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.560 
sampled from the canvass community question form in mid 2020,

30
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.300 
when many instructors were transitioning to online teaching set-ups

31
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.020 
often for the first time.

32
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.250 
or what did we find out through our analysis.
we identified three key things.

33
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.890 
firstly we identified the high level types of questions being

34
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.330 
asked by instructors and segmented based on this.

35
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.620 
we found three cross-cutting themes the types
of issues that instructors were discussing.

36
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.980 
and we also attempted through analysis to identify some of

37
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.340 
the kinds of questions that tended to get answered and which

38
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.270 
questions were not being answered as effectively in the form.

39
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.610 
in this video we'll focus on two and three,
but for more info

40
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610 
on part one please refer to our paper.

41
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.460 
let's discuss now. some of the key themes for types of issues

42
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.050 
we observed in our sample of posts.

43
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.220 
the first theme that we observed were issues where an instructor

44
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.290 
would simply indicate an end goal for
how they want to set up their course

45
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.710 
or asked a question about how to do a basic set of task in their lms,

46
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.580 
like simply uploading a syllabus or for the course and posting

47
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.700 
it for their students.

48
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.950 
the next thing we observed were issues that surrounded adapting,

49
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.050 
or working within the lms to facilitate a shared learning experience

50
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.060 
between instructors students and in some cases even their parents.

51
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.590 
and these concerns were often regarding resolving disparities

52
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.490 
in what a student sees versus what the instructor
may have actually intended.

53
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.340 
the final and most prevalent theme were those that tended to focus on

54
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.520 
innovating beyond the basic uses of the LMS or
utilizing new features or integrations.

55
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.810 
this makes sense when we consider how many instructors were

56
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.710 
migrating course content from in-person to online,

57
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.310 
often needing to integrate new tools or modifying existing

58
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.870 
tools to support new tasks.

59
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.230 
and having to adapt, or customize the lms to
support unique instructor needs

60
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.410 
like in the following example.

61
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.370 
sometimes instructors would need to
match their LMS or modify it

62
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.710 
to suit a particular instructor goal.

63
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.490 
i usually have on site hands-on anatomy lab practical's with

64
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.410 
the cova nineteen crisis. I need to do this online.

65
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.530 
can i limit the time for each question station to one point
five minutes and allow students

66
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.920 
to return to the stations that they flagged for ten or more minutes.

67
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.280 
these kinds of issues were those where an instructor sought

68
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.690 
to adapt or customize their LMS to suit the particular need

69
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.170 
or goal that they have more effectively.

70
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.660 
but how are these questions and issues getting actually
answered within the form.

71
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.650 
well we attempted to identify some of this,

72
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.190 
we observed that about eighty percent of
questions received an answer.

73
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.870 
but what do we learn about the other twenty percent.

74
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.760 
well we noticed that questions about basic set up most often

75
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.050 
did receive an answer.

76
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.620 
and this makes sense with how forms have been supporting these

77
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
kinds of questions in the past.
but for posts about innovating

78
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.940 
or innovating on the current LMS nearly a third of them received

79
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.520 
no replies at all.

80
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.920 
what does this mean for instructor's ability to find support

81
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.310 
for their lms issues.

82
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.180 
it's clear from our work that there is certainly value in community

83
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.040 
based learning and the form did provide answers for majority of issues.

84
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.470 
but instructors need spaces for supporting each other,

85
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.700 
perhaps having smaller communities,

86
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.480 
or sub communities would be more beneficial for some instructors

87
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.460 
to address their complex issues.

88
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.080 
and there's clearly more need for support
for more complex customisation

89
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.370 
to suit more unique instructor needs.

90
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.090 
we are starting to see some projects that tackle some of the issues.
we've identified

91
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.380 
for example recent work on customizer a tool
that allows instructors to access

92
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.520 
social support for customizing canvas courses within the application.

93
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.090 
but clearly more work is needed in the space to fully address

94
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.850 
the complex widely varying needs of instructors
and their online courses.

95
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.900 
overall we see a lot of opportunity to improve
instructor's experience with lms

96
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.510 
and other software by drawing upon each
cia interaction design research.

97
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.490 
and summary we provided various insights and how instructors.

98
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.950 
use their q a forms to set up troubleshoot
and innovate their online instruction.

99
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.210 
we thank you so much and please feel free
to check out our paper here.

100
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.150 
thank you.

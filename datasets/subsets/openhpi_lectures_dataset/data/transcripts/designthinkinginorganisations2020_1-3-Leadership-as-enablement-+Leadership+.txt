00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.230 
Welcome on our openHPI course
on mastering design thinking

2
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.680 
and organizations. My name is
Falk and today we are covering

3
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.330 
leadership as
enablement.

4
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060 
First of all as always, let's talk
about the learning objectives

5
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.060 
and again we have two to cover for
today. First of all we would like to

6
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
look into the box what kind of
corporate culture is nurturing

7
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.420 
design thinking and here I would
like to report from some academic

8
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.730 
results that we have been investigated
in the last couple of years.

9
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.530 
Secondly I would also like to
address today a quick overview

10
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.070 
of the leadership starts
that are needed or

11
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.830 
kind of supporting design-thinking
initiatives in organizations.

12
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.090 
But before we start let's have a quick view
on our design thinking implementation wheel.

13
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.200 
And as always we are covering
all the different circles that

14
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.220 
are shown in the graphic and the topic of today
is on culture, leadership and communication

15
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.800 
and this is important because the
environment is also setting

16
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.920 
the tone for the successful
implementation of design thinking

17
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.020 
and that's the reason why
we're covering this module.

18
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.900 
So let's start with culture.
Let's talk about what makes up

19
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.750 
a successful organizational culture where
design thinking can basically spread

20
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.840 
and grow over time.
And based on

21
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.240 
a number of qualitative studies that we
have conducted over the last years

22
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.200 
we have figured out certain parameters that
are supporting the successful implementation.

23
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.600 
For sure not every parameter is required
or is not required in the intensity

24
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.380 
of ten by looking at the scale
from one to ten but the more

25
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.450 
you can fulfill, the more you can cover
with your organizational culture

26
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.510 
the better it is. And the first
one that was perceived by a

27
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.530 
lot of managing teams when we talked
to them was that flat hierarchies

28
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.070 
and a way of open communication
is helping in an organization

29
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.220 
to spread design thinking. And the
reason for flat hierarchies is

30
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.270 
because design thinking is an age old
methodology or can be classified

31
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.940 
as an age old methodology. We have to
deal quickly with decision making,

32
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.270 
we have to deal quickly with
producing results and what was

33
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.590 
often communicated from
management teams what was that

34
00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.820 
steep hierarchies or large hierarchies prevent
quick communication mechanism and also

35
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.520 
open communication within teams.
Therefore one of the recommendations

36
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.610 
is to flatten hierarchies not
necessarily because we don't

37
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.470 
want to have managers and our
employees in an organization but

38
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.580 
mostly because we want to speed up the
communication and therefore also speeding up

39
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.250 
the way how we work on a daily base. The
second criteria that was perceived as

40
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.960 
most supportive to design-thinking
culture is to foster empathy, to

41
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.320 
implement a culture that is genetically
curious and interested in

42
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.110 
knowing how the
team members feel.

43
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.950 
So empathising for the ones that
you are working together with,

44
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.070 
also empathizing with people that
are surrounding you but also

45
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.060 
trying to build up empathy with
your clients, customers and

46
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.320 
stakeholders that might be using products
future in the future process.

47
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.460 
So a culture that fosters
genetically empathy and curiosity

48
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.880 
is perceived as most supportive for
design-thinking implementation.

49
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.790 
The third point that I want to
highlight here is of implementing

50
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.330 
a culture that is encouraging
self initiative and also a kind

51
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.480 
of risk taking mentality.
What does that mean?

52
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.620 
Self initiative is something where
I can delegate responsibility

53
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.030 
to everyone in the team, not just
to leaders or managers, but

54
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.090 
to everyone in the team. I try to
motivate them to take little

55
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.240 
risks and we will talk soon about
the failure as well, so, but

56
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.820 
enabling them to to take risks,
to experiment and by doing so

57
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.750 
to take self responsibility
and self initiative.

58
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.400 
Why is this helping? It's helping
because you leverage in a

59
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.370 
much better way that the entire capability
of your team because everyone can

60
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.890 
contribute, everyone
can be part of it

61
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.690 
and on the other hand you speed up
things, right. You don't have to wait on

62
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.740 
people who create a bottleneck
in your team but you can as

63
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.410 
a team perform much faster much more agile
than in a world where you don't

64
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.160 
have to self initiative and
risk taking mentality

65
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.180 
embedded. So the fourth point is that
you want to have an organizational

66
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.360 
environment where you are collaborate
and where you foster teamwork.

67
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.840 
So there's coming together, being
together being responsible

68
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.940 
as a team for the outcome, that
is mission critical for most

69
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.820 
of the design thinking projects because
only then you can again be speedy,

70
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.200 
you can adapt more quickly, you
can learn quicker because you

71
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.190 
exchange as a team more frequently
on what failed and what what works.

72
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.090 
And that brings me up to the fifth point,
so being playful and to experiment.

73
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.020 
And I know some serious and maybe
also more conservative managers

74
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.300 
they might believe playfulness how
does that fit to our business?

75
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.270 
And it's maybe not the interpretation that
you might think, right, playing around.

76
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.540 
It's more about having the mindset
of quick prototyping, having

77
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.580 
the mindset of experimenting and trying
out things as quick as possible

78
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.590 
and with the right
fidelity level.

79
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.590 
And especially in
my experience,

80
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.660 
as you might know I'm
German from my origin,

81
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.140 
I know that our culture for example
is prone to high fidelity

82
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.930 
prototypes on high fidelity
products. So but in a design

83
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.750 
thinking project it's most often
advise to step back a bit from this

84
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.820 
high quality and high fidelity view when
we are in the beginning of a project

85
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.810 
because in the beginning
experimentation helps you

86
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.990 
to prototype
things quick

87
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.550 
and a prototype means also putting your
own assumptions into that prototype

88
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.160 
and with a quick prototype you can
experiment, you can test quicker

89
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.160 
and you can also fail earlier
and that is helping you display

90
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.540 
for an experimental approach is
helping you to get rid of all

91
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.250 
the wrong assumptions that you
might have about the market.

92
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.650 
And by the end it's speeding up
development processes when

93
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.730 
you're using design thinking, it's also
opening up the communication

94
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:08.470 
within the team because you're much more
talking about failures and wrong assumptions,

95
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:14.300 
you correct yourself. So this
leads me to embracing failures

96
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.840 
and here again we are not talking about
failures in a traditional sense

97
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.310 
that you wait and wait and wait
until you fail and then you

98
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.330 
have a huge problem in front of you.
But here it's more meant in a way

99
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.430 
that you fail with the assumptions
that you have as an individual

100
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.040 
or as a team as soon as you
can in order to learn.

101
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.670 
So each failure that you can
embrace, each failure that you

102
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:46.680 
make as a team should be shown and
pictured as a learning success

103
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.600 
because it meant that
you had something

104
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.280 
wrong assumed about the
subjects, about your products

105
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.830 
and therefore you failed
and the earlier you fail,

106
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.570 
the quicker you can adapt to what
makes you successful at the

107
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:09.130 
end of a project. And then lastly
you should foster a culture

108
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:15.060 
that strives for continuous learning.
So having a curious mindset

109
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:21.430 
implemented in your organization helps
you to progress nothing is finished.

110
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:27.440 
So even if you are an expert in
design thinking or if I would

111
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.360 
claim myself as being an expert
in design thinking, it does

112
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.710 
not mean that I know everything.
There's every day something new

113
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.450 
to see and to learn and this is
meant by continuous learning

114
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.780 
that you should foster a culture in your
organization that is constantly

115
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:56.080 
and genetically curious, he is also listening
to orders so having this ability to

116
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:02.510 
to perceive and to see what is
new and what can be added to

117
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.810 
all the knowledge and wisdom that I have
collected over the last years.

118
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:17.010 
So this is basically the set of
criteria that are mostly perceived with

119
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.850 
a successful cultures and as I
said in the beginning, it's not

120
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.020 
needed that you have to be
perfect in every element

121
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.570 
but what you should look at is
how you can improve with your

122
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.630 
team, with your organization on each
of the elements individually

123
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.270 
and with each improvement
step you take,

124
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.140 
the better you will be at the end
and a better design thinking

125
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.690 
and innovation project will work
out for you and your organization.

126
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.110 
But all this, all the cultural
elements can only be successful

127
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.450 
if also the leadership
is adopting to such

128
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.710 
promises and to such

129
00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.880 
cultural elements.

130
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.430 
And what makes up a successful
leadership in that context?

131
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.580 
What I would like to highlight here is
a study that was conducted by IBM

132
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.580 
a couple of years ago and they
asked top managers around the

133
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.800 
globe what do you think are the most important
leadership qualities that are needed.

134
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.980 
And maybe surprising or
maybe not surprising,

135
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.390 
creativity is
number one,

136
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.350 
beside integrity in global
thinking. But by far number one

137
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.360 
that was seen by the global leader
community was the creative element that

138
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.010 
a leader needs to bring in into the
business in order to be successful.

139
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.910 
So to frame it more clearly what
does creativity mean in business?

140
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.740 
Basically creativity in business
means that on one hand side

141
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.520 
you are able to constantly
produce, create, develop

142
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.340 
original ideas that
drive your business

143
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.620 
but not only to create those ideas
constantly but also putting

144
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.680 
them in a context of
serving for purpose.

145
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.780 
And this is what makes up the
leadership element, the purpose

146
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.850 
because you as a leader or
as a to become leader,

147
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.260 
you need to convey a message to
your team why they should work

148
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.460 
for a certain topic, why they
should engage into an initiative.

149
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.250 
And it's not just enough

150
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:44.440 
to be the big mind on new ideas
but also you have to inspire

151
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.310 
them, you have to take them with
you by sharing a purpose that

152
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:56.420 
can be served by the team. This leads me to what
is the definition of creative leadership.

153
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.470 
Creative leadership from our
opinion is defined as the ability

154
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.920 
to deliberately engage one's imagination
to define and guide a group

155
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.550 
towards another goal.

156
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.030 
So basically a direction
that is new for the group.

157
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.420 
And here again just to
emphasize it again

158
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:22.910 
it's the ability to deliberately
engage one's imagination and

159
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.410 
please remember back on what
I said to the culture.

160
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:32.760 
We need to enable people to speak
up, to take risks right and

161
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:38.050 
only if you have that culture matched
up with such leadership skills

162
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:46.070 
where everyone can have an imagination
of the future or a novel goal,

163
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.770 
only then you can be successful.
So creative leaders they

164
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.900 
they have this
kind of mindset

165
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.870 
in pushing their
own teams.

166
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.670 
So that means that creative
leaders are not just good in

167
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:09.290 
steering teams in terms of converging
behaviors, so creating resolutions

168
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:15.260 
making them work, implementing them, but
creative leader on the other hand

169
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.430 
are also helping teams to think
more in a diverging mode. So

170
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:25.270 
to be explorative, to be curious,
to look around and again to

171
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:30.300 
take risk by looking around and
taking and seeing failures

172
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.730 
as a chance to learn and
anticipate into new contexts.

173
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.550 
So on that graphic you
see that very good

174
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.890 
that the leader, a creative leader
needs to cover the diverging

175
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:47.850 
part and the converging parts and
by doing so they help the team

176
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.790 
to get out of this
area of familiarity,

177
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.820 
because only if you leave
your own box of thinking

178
00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.040 
only if you leave the cosy space
of what you already know,

179
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.340 
only then you can be very creative,
only then you come up with

180
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.930 
novel goals, with
novel ideas.

181
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:17.660 
And that we call the area of discovery
where you can lead people towards.

182
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.820 
So what do sea level characteristics
on that topic and they

183
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:29.030 
match up very well with the cultural
criteria that you should work on.

184
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:35.420 
So first of all leaders are seeking
for options and not for plans.

185
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.750 
That sounds simple but it's
definitely not because our nowadays

186
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.930 
corporate culture is very much
driven from plan or from plans. So

187
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.410 
organizations want to know where
are you in one year, in two

188
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.620 
years, in three years; please
provide me a business plan etc.

189
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.650 
But it's not that simple anymore
with most solutions and products

190
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.080 
that we are dealing with especially when it
comes to innovation and design thinking,

191
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.740 
we cannot fix or make fixed plans,
because the market environment

192
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.670 
is turning fast
and speedy.

193
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:18.700 
We cannot foresee futures in three,
four, five year that clearly

194
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:25.330 
and therefore creative leaders have to
have the ability to think in options

195
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.280 
and also to communicate this
strongly to the team that there

196
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.880 
is not just one point that we are
targeting at, but that we have a

197
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.110 
plethora of different

198
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:45.330 
options that we shoot at and depending
on the market environment

199
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:50.660 
we might turn into option two or
three later on on our process

200
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.610 
but we do not communicate
fixed plans anymore.

201
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.410 
The second criteria that we have
figured out is important is

202
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.580 
looking for possibilities. So
not thinking in terms of what

203
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:10.810 
is not doable because of our nowadays
constraints, but what could we do

204
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.870 
if we overcome certain barriers
and I know from pharmaceutical

205
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.380 
industry for example it's highly
complicated because most of

206
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:24.550 
the leaders they have to deal with
constraints that are set up by

207
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:29.490 
fda for example and those constraints
are set up for good reason.

208
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:34.170 
So I don't want to question those
those rules that exist but

209
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.690 
when it comes to think
about a new world

210
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.700 
that needs to be filled
up with creativity,

211
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:46.760 
leaders should be able to bend those
constraints, to think what can we

212
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.800 
else do, how can we improve things
and then reframing it again

213
00:17:52.970 --> 00:18:01.140 
into the existing boundaries. But we need to have
this mentality of looking impossibilities.

214
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.470 
So then I don't stress this again
too much but it's this willingness

215
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.470 
from a leader's perspective to let people
experiment and to learn from failures

216
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:16.180 
that genetically needs to be
embedded and they also need to

217
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.400 
pursue a vision
with intent.

218
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.320 
You need to communicate this and
you also need to communicate

219
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:29.390 
the vision more often than you
think. People want to know where

220
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.600 
a certain step leads to, to what option
it leads to and as a good leader,

221
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.640 
creative leader you should pursue
question with intent. And

222
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.310 
most of these people are tireless
and inventive. So they come

223
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.270 
up with their own ideas, sure,
listening to the others as well.

224
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:54.380 
So letting others speak up is important
too but they're tireless and inventive

225
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.350 
and when they communicate with teams
they also challenge assumptions.

226
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:05.490 
And again in an organizational set up
that feels hard sometimes because

227
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.380 
maybe you as a leader have set
up certain boundaries etc

228
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.810 
in previous meetings but as a
creative leader you should be able

229
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.670 
to even challenge those assumptions
that you have set up by yourself

230
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:26.570 
and that were set up by your team
constantly. That's the seek

231
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:32.910 
for the real truth and don't get caught
by your own assumptions in that regard.

232
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.180 
You should also be able to
empower the talent in your team.

233
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:44.060 
So everyone has a gift, has a gift by
nature or most most probably many gifts.

234
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.730 
And this is what you need to look
at at your team and in your team

235
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:54.110 
who is gifted with what and then
emphasizing that, showing that

236
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.810 
talent, showing
that gift

237
00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:03.580 
and empower it and then lastly you also should
be comfortable about spanning boundaries.

238
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.010 
What does that mean in
organisations? It basically means

239
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.660 
that you should break
up silos thinking

240
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.690 
that you should be able
to break up barriers,

241
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:20.730 
personal barriers, organizational
barriers and you should become

242
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.340 
someone who's spanning
these boundaries.

243
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.360 
So by looking at the criteria as
we know that these are good

244
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.560 
leadership criterias that
leads to creative leadership.

245
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.370 
So but now you might
ask yourself,

246
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.770 
can I change,

247
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.060 
can I become someone like such a
person, can I become a leader,

248
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:52.610 
am I a leader? I would answer, maybe,
maybe not. Maybe you can transform,

249
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.830 
maybe not.

250
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.740 
I think just as a personal recommendation
it's maybe not so much important

251
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:05.000 
to really transform into such
a leader if you're not

252
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.870 
really getting
close to it,

253
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.490 
because we also need
other characteristics.

254
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.660 
But for sure

255
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.480 
if you want
to go that way

256
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:24.210 
try to work on us, on these criteria.
Second answer is you are who you are.

257
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:29.700 
So if you're such kind of person,
try to improve yourself. If not

258
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.600 
don't struggle with trying to improve
too much on these criteria, because

259
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.890 
you are a manager maybe, you're
good in operational management

260
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.550 
but maybe not in creative
leadership. So it's

261
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.700 
there is nothing bad in it but don't
try it if you feel struggling

262
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.230 
all the time of it. So one last
comment that I want to make is

263
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.730 
we are aware of your
middle management layer.

264
00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.160 
For sure you don't have that
problem or challenge if you have

265
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.500 
flat hierarchies already in your
organization but if you don't,

266
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.720 
please pay a bit attention to
it. Nowadays environment is

267
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.050 
really turning fast. It's
really quick, right.

268
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:19.400 
And what you have to accept
in our environment is

269
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.590 
that less security

270
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:29.990 
is a fact of life and less security means
also more communication and it also

271
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.710 
means you have to trust
more in your employees.

272
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.750 
But what we sometimes see in
organisations who are well established

273
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.220 
and may be a bit
crusty, right,

274
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.190 
that the middle management and
you cannot generalize this, but

275
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:52.150 
that the middle management he has some
kind of very protective behavior,

276
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.990 
right. They want to protect their own
turfs and that leads to sometimes

277
00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:04.550 
into styles like target management. Some of them
are politically motivated, uncommunicative,

278
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.400 
sometimes even dictatorial, right.
And I'm sure you can imagine

279
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.830 
what I'm meaning by talking about
this. So keep that in mind

280
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.410 
when you want to set up a new
leadership style that you also

281
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.430 
take revieweed this middle
management layer which sometimes

282
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.920 
seems to have this protection
shell around them

283
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.450 
and it's not pulling on the
same string like you want.

284
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.070 
So as a management I'd advice look
into that. It's not just enough

285
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.210 
to work on the culture in general
and also on the leadership

286
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.820 
but what you should also do is to
analyze carefully what layer

287
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:48.060 
has what goal and how do
they perceive the change

288
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.290 
and then you should work on a
strategy how to take them with you.

289
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.270 
To sum it up and as always let's have
a look again on our implementation here.

290
00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:04.110 
So we covered today that bubble of
culture leadership and communication

291
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.080 
and I hope I was able to provide
you some insights on culture

292
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.560 
and also on leadership.

293
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.200 
And with that I would
like to leave you

294
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.140 
and I wish you a good day. Thank
you very much for attending.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.110 
So Hanadi, we've been
talking a lot about

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.760 
culture already, now this week
and about half that's cultural

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.440 
dimensions. But how do we
get this intercultural

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.060 
competence that we've been addressing
it in the beginning?....

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.230 
yeah true, we would like to talk about
intercultural competence itself

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.720 
but as i said like it was really
important to understand culture,

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.100 
what culture dimensions we've got,
how to improve culture sensitivity

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.760 
in order to understand
intercultural competence.

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.910 
Which is basically the ability
to function effectively across

10
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.230 
cultures and to think
and act appropriately

11
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.500 
and to communicate and work with
people from other cultures

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.320 
whether at home or abroad there
are actually several definitions

13
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.060 
of the intercultural competence
we just presented one here

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.500 
but all of these
definitions

15
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.060 
they have sufficient agreement on
the elements of intercultural

16
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.040 
competence. So for example
is developmental in nature

17
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.540 
you cannot just get it
overnight, you need

18
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.930 
to work on it, you need
to go through different

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100 
circles of learning in order to
improve your intercultural

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.680 
confidence. It is like any other
skill you need to practice

21
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.430 
...you need to train it.. exactly, the
more you practice the better you become.

22
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.470 
Intercultural competence
have three elements

23
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.400 
knowledge, skills and attitude.
You need to have the mindset

24
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.770 
you need to gain some specific
knowledge about specific culture

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.230 
or about your own culture you need
to have the ability to improve

26
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.990 
the skills but most
importantly you need to have

27
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.200 
the attitude, a heart set
and you need to be open

28
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.350 
from inside to other
cultures...an this is kind of

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.810 
the basic framework
that you need, the

30
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.960 
mindset and the heart set
that you want to be able to

31
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.640 
discuss with other cultures and
that's the same for any culture

32
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.600 
you're dealing with and the
the knowledge may differ

33
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.040 
from culture to culture because
all the cultures are different.

34
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.340 
.....Yes you're right, so if
we talk about knowledge

35
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.940 
a in order to develop understanding
of different cultural groups

36
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.220 
we need first to be aware
of our own culture

37
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.060 
you need to have, to know how
to understand your identities

38
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.100 
and you would be able
to understand another

39
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.530 
once identity. And once you develop
this you move to the culture

40
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.830 
specific knowledge so if you are
interested in french culture,

41
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.470 
you start reading, analysing
what you're reading and be

42
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.680 
like a more you develop a
deeper understanding of their

43
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.270 
values of their beliefs so you
know the specific knowledge

44
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.030 
and then actually you
need to be aware of the

45
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.000 
sociolinguistic aspect,
because sometimes

46
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.090 
non-verbal communication actually
creates a misunderstanding

47
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.720 
and whenever you say
something it may be

48
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.210 
understood different
in another culture

49
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.690 
which you didn't mean
in the first place.

50
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.770 
yeah I remember when we first
met we had such a situation

51
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.360 
and you was thinking that
i'm shouting to you

52
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.550 
he was shouting...
no I wasn't...

53
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.450 
This is a perfect example of
misunderstanding because yeah

54
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.360 
it happened to us like the
first time i ever saw Tom,

55
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.560 
we had this sort of misunderstanding
he was presenting his

56
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.280 
work and i was commenting on
it and i thought he got

57
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.920 
offended, he did not, according to
him but that was my interpretation

58
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.240 
to the situation, but we got it
solved we got itself ....how?...

59
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.360 
with a piece of cake......yes, cake
always works well. So once you

60
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.320 
become aware of this verbal and
nonverbal communication and

61
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.890 
you try to adjust to
one's speeds and

62
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
like you develop this understanding
it's also probably a

63
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.680 
good idea to have a grasp of
global issues entrance and see

64
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.950 
how this specific culture fits
within the hall like you know

65
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.190 
the over all a sphere of
knowledge. And the skills

66
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.910 
if we talk about skills we
could use the acronym love.

67
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.160 
Like love presents listening,
observing, viewing the world from

68
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.740 
others' perspectives and
evaluating.....That sounds a lot like

69
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.110 
design thinking to me, actually
if I see thats I kind

70
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.240 
basically four of the
six points in the...

71
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.640 
It does sound like design thinking
yes we use this concept

72
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.230 
a lot in design thinking
because it's really effective

73
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.870 
and the skills here like you
know the skills you need to

74
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.630 
develop your intercultural
competence are the same skills you

75
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.790 
would use in any sort of communication.
Like when you communicate

76
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.020 
with your wife, with
your kid with anyone

77
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.060 
you need to develop your listening
skills you need to be able

78
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.800 
to observe well, you need to put
yourself in their shoes you

79
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.070 
need to evaluate what just
happened you know and why we use

80
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.220 
this a lot in design thinking
as i said it's effective

81
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.220 
because we actually work with
international teams most of the

82
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.790 
time we intentionally
form teams to come from

83
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.340 
different backgrounds different
cultural backgrounds different

84
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.630 
professional backgrounds
which you may encounter in

85
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.400 
when working remotely, so it's really
important for you to develop

86
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.830 
these skills because you will
become a better communicator.

87
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.640 
....And we've been
talking a lot about

88
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.390 
these kind of differences
between countries between

89
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.380 
but actually culture is not
only a thing of a difference

90
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.160 
between countries it is
also within a country

91
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.060 
lots of subcultures for
example that you have

92
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.870 
which might not be
kind of a really

93
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.760 
understanding each other
too well or even like

94
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.240 
southern germany is
pretty much different

95
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.670 
from this part for
germany...that's why dialogue

96
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.610 
here is important like when
you have a normal dialogue

97
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.150 
it's different from debate
you are discussing not to

98
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.340 
win in debate, so that's
why developing these

99
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.300 
skills is really important and
also we talked about attitudes,

100
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.940 
you need to to have the
attitudes towards

101
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.390 
accepting other cultures
and be open about it

102
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.520 
here we could call them the
court of emotional resilence.

103
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.650 
An emotional resilence is
the ability to adopt

104
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.980 
in times of stress or crisis.
And CORD stands for

105
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.080 
curiosity, openness,
respect and discovery.

106
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.430 
So you need to be curious about
these differences you know

107
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.170 
because once you are curious
to start reading more you

108
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.310 
start like being aware about as
we said on culture but also

109
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.080 
about other cultures, you need
to be open minded don't judge

110
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.020 
their beliefs, don't be critical
of what they do if you don't

111
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.850 
agree with.... defer judgement....
again design-thinking.

112
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.100 
Advise always there is
a like a few courses

113
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.560 
on openHPI if you are interested
in learning more about

114
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.110 
design thinking. Particularly observing
and listening, great courses

115
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.510 
you should go there....

116
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.700 
And also respect, it comes from
design thinking probably

117
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.970 
you need to respect other people, i mean
probably most of this sound familiar or

118
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.020 
you believe you're doing
it but believe me like

119
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.180 
the more you be aware about them
you would realise like sometimes

120
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.430 
we are human beings, we judge
without even realizing it

121
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.440 
so once you start paying
attention to your attitude

122
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.220 
you become actually better and
you start deferring judgment

123
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:03.210 
and also discovery like a we talked
about uncertainty and ambiguity

124
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.720 
how this might create anxiety
you could you could just avoid

125
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.530 
this by tolerating ambiguity and
a viewing it as a sense of

126
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.250 
discovery so it will be like an
enjoyable process instead of

127
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.930 
being a stressful process
so again let's share

128
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.960 
which of the elements actually
that we just introduced

129
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.690 
did you find the most challenging
to adapt and of course we

130
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.560 
want to know kind of you experiences
or other frameworks that

131
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.650 
you maybe know they would
like to share or recommend

132
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.860 
and whatever you
want to comment on

133
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.160 
what we just yeah feel free to
post in the discussion board

134
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.470 
yeah ok thank you
Hanadi, thank you Tom

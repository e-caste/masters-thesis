00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.750 
In our openHPI course about digital
identities, now we want to have a

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.010 
closer look on social engineering
attacks on users with the goal

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.850 
to steal digital
identities.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.470 
We already mentioned
this attack,

5
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.840 
this class of
attacks, which are

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.730 
subsumized under the notion
of social engineering.

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.960 
What is social engineering? Social
engineering is to exploit human weaknesses,

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.790 
to provoke certain
reactions.

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.100 
For example false identity,
stolen identity

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.750 
exploits human weakness.
So, for example,

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.490 
use the stolen identity of a
person that's very familiar

12
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.360 
with the victim or he

13
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.410 
makes some, if you do not do something,
he use fear or respect or helpfulness,

14
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.010 
human attitudes to misuse this
to get access to,

15
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.590 
in most cases, to digital

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.890 
identity or that the victim
is forced to make something

17
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.170 
what he or she would not do
under normal circumstance.

18
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.890 
For example releasing information such
as identity data or granting access

19
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.890 
to a protected system or to a
protected location. So the

20
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.920 
attacker for example works, uses a fake
identity of a system administrator or of the

21
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.890 
boss or of a team member
or others to force

22
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.070 
the user to do something or to do
something which helps the attacker to

23
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.450 
get access to the system
or to get access to data.

24
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
Most common social engineering
method in the internet is phishing.

25
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.910 
And so we have to look
in more detail how these

26
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.710 
phishing attacks are working. This
is also to help you to see, to

27
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.760 
give you some awareness that one
really should look twice

28
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.140 
in case of getting certain mails
which asked us to do something.

29
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.780 
So phishing is an attack technique
for fraudulent acquisition

30
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.390 
of sensitive information. So the typical
procedure is that a fraudulent

31
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.780 
email is sent with a trust
worthy sender address.

32
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.650 
You remember it is not so difficult
to fake a sender address

33
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.240 
to falsify the sender address. For
example if a mail sent with the

34
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.840 
address of the bank or a company
or authority or family

35
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.790 
and the sender address

36
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.390 
gives the user the hint it is clear.
The people from the banks

37
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.770 
they want to have they want to do
something with my account. Or

38
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.910 
my boss wants to do something
with a work or family member

39
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.330 
asked me to do something
for him. So the

40
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.680 
sender address is easily to modify,
to fake this spoofing attack

41
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.860 
and the attacker in this
phishing mails they select the

42
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.790 
sender address, the fake
sender address exactly

43
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.710 
according to the information to
the spoofed information they

44
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.410 
want to get access. Or a typical
way of such a phishing, typical

45
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.460 
manner of such a phishing
attacks is to exploit

46
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.980 
the acquired trust, to initiate some
desired response. For example

47
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.490 
to release data, to click on a link,
to attend a dangerous website

48
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.710 
or to install a
malware or others.

49
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.050 
So we have our victim

50
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.440 
and the attacker here sends an email
with the falsified sender address.

51
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.730 
He claims to be the

52
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.880 
email comes and
claims to be

53
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.260 
to come from
the support

54
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.410 
department of the
victim's bank.

55
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.120 
And then it is the victim is asked
to login because some technical

56
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:51.180 
administration things need to be done
or some new services should be offered

57
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.420 
and there is a link in this email
which is not the link of the bank

58
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.380 
but it looks very similar like the
website of the bank. Here for example,

59
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.230 
it is not bank.org, it is hank.org
and if I am not looking carefully

60
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.240 
one thinks ok its comes
from the bank and

61
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.220 
it is not. So the

62
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.510 
fake page asks, please log in

63
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.950 
and then the

64
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.890 
suggested operator people
think they are cooperating is

65
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.700 
with the bank website but in reality
they are interacting with this

66
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.970 
malicious website
and give

67
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.730 
information they usually
only give to their bank.

68
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.680 
And then the operator, the
attacker can get from

69
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.550 
his fake website information. For
example, digital identity

70
00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:01.530 
password or others and then he can go
directly to the bank and can misuse

71
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.430 
the bank account
of the victim.

72
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.300 
To give some examples, some more
example. So the goal of such a

73
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.020 
phishing attack
could be the

74
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.380 
recipient of sensitive information.
So like in this illustration,

75
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.710 
the attacker sent an email with a
fake sender, here for example

76
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.320 
with a fake sender the message comes
from the World Health Organization.

77
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.840 
And what I explain here is a real
attack we saw in the internet.

78
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.640 
It looks very much like the website of
the World Health Organization, here

79
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.210 
through some attached documents
on safety measures regarding

80
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.180 
the spreading of Corona
virus, click here.

81
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.980 
So the attacker wants to force
the user to click here and in

82
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.210 
the thinking that here
are more information

83
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.990 
how to protect against
Corona virus or others,

84
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.040 
the user clicks here but in reality
he's not on the website of World

85
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.840 
Health Organization, he
is on a fake website of

86
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.280 
the attacker.

87
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.860 
Phishing often can be
recognized on some small

88
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:32.510 
mistakes, on some lack of personal contact
or on some differences in the URL.

89
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.140 
Like on the previous page this
was hank instead of bank

90
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.540 
and here it is "dear sir". So
it is some impersonal

91
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.150 
mail which fits for everyone. Typically
when you interact with your bank or others,

92
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.510 
they have your name and they
will use the name if they have,

93
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.110 
to do something.

94
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.510 
There are other widely
scattered phishing attacks

95
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.630 
but these are sometimes
called traditional phishing.

96
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.010 
Traditional phishing

97
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:21.050 
attacks - this is relatively
easily to detect.

98
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.670 
It is easy to detect because
there are a number of mistakes,

99
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.430 
for example, the attacker do not
know what my bank is, so they send

100
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.620 
the website of any bank.

101
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:39.390 
I see it's not my bank. So it could
be something wrong. So they

102
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.610 
are easy to detect and therefore
these phishing emails are

103
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.050 
very widely distributed.

104
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:53.510 
And with many millions of potential
victims it's like a spam email

105
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:59.810 
and if the attacker do this and
send this mail to millions of

106
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.150 
potential victims, then
even a very low portion

107
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:14.970 
trust this email and do the action
the attacker wants to get. So

108
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:20.120 
they have a very low conversion rate
but it is sufficient to achieve

109
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.630 
a significant success.

110
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.550 
What are the problems for the
attacker performing such attacks?

111
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.980 
So, in the internet users are well
sensitized in common phishing.

112
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.500 
This is meanwhile known and people
had made some experience with this,

113
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.990 
so they are much more
careful than it was done

114
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:50.230 
years ago. There are many reports in
the media that speak about it. Another

115
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.040 
problem for attacker, when this
mail reaches many recipients,

116
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.810 
then often they do not
apply in the details.

117
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:09.150 
So it is easy to detect by the users
and the success rate is not so high.

118
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.750 
So the sender is a bank but it is
not the bank of the victim. So this

119
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.380 
is a problem for the

120
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.080 
attackers and for that
reason meanwhile they

121
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.310 
personalize phishing mail. And this
is much more dangerous.

122
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.460 
So attackers are increasingly
turning on personalized phishing.

123
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.770 
This is called
spear phishing

124
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:43.360 
as they no longer can achieve their
goals with these normal broadly

125
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.810 
sent phishing mails. And what is the idea of
the personalized phishing? The idea is

126
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.910 
that the attacker, before it starts
to send such a phishing mail,

127
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.790 
he collects a lot
of data about

128
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.500 
his victim. So in a
preliminary phase very detailed,

129
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.300 
often private information
about the victim

130
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:17.100 
is collected so that the email can be
sent much more in a way that the

131
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:22.330 
recipient will trust it because
there are so many details and

132
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.390 
personal details in that phishing
mail, in this spear phishing mail,

133
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:35.170 
that users the recipient trust it because
nobody is expecting that an attacker

134
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:41.990 
knows all this. So this is helpful, the
many detailed personal information or

135
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.980 
sensitive information from work.

136
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:51.650 
It is helpful to find trustworthiness
for example using the

137
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.650 
identity of a person the victim
knows and trusts very well.

138
00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.840 
And then the phishing mail
is sent from a fake sender

139
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.660 
and the victim trusts this fake
sender because in the message

140
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.390 
there are many
information that only the

141
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:10.790 
sender knows.

142
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:17.960 
In this way the success rate is increased
a lot. So the chances of success

143
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.070 
with such a´ scam are
very high but the effort

144
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.820 
of course for attackers are significantly
higher than for a traditional

145
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.990 
phishing mail which is
sent unpersonalised.

146
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:37.860 
So many attacks on the internet are based
on previous personalised phishing attacks.

147
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.540 
So the spear phishing is
therefore very dangerous

148
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.850 
and it is specifically
aimed at high ranked

149
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.760 
target persons, for example heads of companies,
politicians, high ranking officials,

150
00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:03.020 
celebrities and sensitive objects from
military, from business, politics,

151
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.840 
or financial industry. They are selected
as a victim of such personalised

152
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:14.380 
phishing mail or also professional attackers,
for example in politics, in states,

153
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:20.880 
activists, in organized crime. So with this
personalisation of the phishing mail

154
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.360 
the success rate is much higher.
The attackers have more work

155
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.420 
to do because they have to prepare,
they have to find out this sensitive

156
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.220 
individual data but

157
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.310 
at the end they
get typically

158
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.050 
much success with
such a

159
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.860 
personalised
phishing attack.

160
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.190 
There are other social engineering
techniques that are used

161
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.920 
to get access to sensitive data or to get
access to IT system, baiting for example

162
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.760 
is exploiting the curiosity or
the curiosity of the victim.

163
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:08.110 
There is for example a distribution of
gifts with a hidden malicious

164
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:13.060 
functionality. So USB
sticks with malware, apps

165
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.780 
and websites where you can see what
you have won in a lottery but

166
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.500 
indeed you are in a fraudulent
website and they want to get

167
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.050 
your data or they want to install
a malware on your system.

168
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.960 
Pretexting is another

169
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:40.130 
social engineering technique. Faking stories
or lies in order to pursue victims

170
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:46.390 
to disclose information or to react
in a certain way, for example

171
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.680 
send money or
send other things.

172
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:56.500 
The attackers they tell a story, a story
while pretending to be another

173
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.950 
authority or an initiative which
is fighting for some goods

174
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:08.710 
and so the people believe
in this story and follow what

175
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.540 
the attackers
want them to do.

176
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.680 
And then there is a reverse
social engineering as another social

177
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.170 
engineering attack
and here the attacker contacts

178
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.070 
the victim seeking help to gain
trust, help him to overcome

179
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.710 
some problems the victim has
because of some malware or others

180
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.220 
and in this way to
make it more wrong then

181
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.610 
instead of help him to
improve the situation.

182
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.880 
Now what are the protective
measures against social engineering?

183
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:52.170 
Of course the most important is to raise
the awareness, to raise awareness

184
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.650 
as a user. This is done through
education, for example like

185
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.570 
our course, take part
in our course.

186
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.060 
This is also possible through
occasionally test with phishing emails.

187
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.180 
So inside your company
try out whether the

188
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:16.270 
people are aware that they are not
immediately trusting when emails

189
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.470 
come and ask them
to do something.

190
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:24.610 
Then every time it's important
to verify the identity

191
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.740 
of the alleged
counterpart.

192
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:33.270 
I mentioned that all these
attacks are done under a wrong

193
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.740 
address, under a fake
address. So find out,

194
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.900 
for example,
by contacting

195
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.370 
this person with that
address, whether

196
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.030 
this person really sent you this mail
or really asked you to do this.

197
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.230 
So in case of doubt
it is better

198
00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.120 
to distrust and to ask
for a proof of identity.

199
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.980 
Then use secure
authentication.

200
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.710 
Authentication, we discussed about
authentications. There are weak form,

201
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.390 
weak passwords for example, or strong passwords
or multifactor authentication use

202
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.270 
trustworthy certificates which
prevents that attacker have

203
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.850 
the possibility to interact with
you with the wrong identity.

204
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.440 
And then a responsible
handling of personal

205
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.030 
information is CA and O.

206
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.430 
Be careful what kind of information
you are giving to the outside

207
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.450 
world. What kind of information, personal
information to give to a service.

208
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.850 
A certain amount you have to give
to form the digital identity

209
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:49.660 
but for example in social media
it's not necessary to post any

210
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.970 
private thing
that happened

211
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:58.830 
because this helps to give information
to the attacker that they can misuse

212
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.710 
for personalizing
such phishing mails.

213
00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.170 
Then through the check
of the sender address,

214
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.920 
also you can protect yourself from
a social engineering attack.

215
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.930 
There is a problem that when
you see the sender address

216
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:22.180 
if you look behind the scene, you
see it is not the real address.

217
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:28.050 
So sometimes the email system display
names in the email software which is not

218
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.950 
the right sender address. So when
sensitive information is requested,

219
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.840 
first confirm the request
with the service provider,

220
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.700 
interact with your bank is it
really true that you want to

221
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.650 
install a new system
or other things, to

222
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.790 
detect such a phishing attack, such
attacks by social engineering.

223
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.030 
And then be careful. Be
careful to follow links.

224
00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.660 
Links you do not know, to type in
a new URL that's a different

225
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.230 
way but if you click
and if it's not the

226
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:09.710 
click to the URL to the website it
is claimed then it's a great

227
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:15.990 
possibility that you end up on
a malicious website which

228
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:24.370 
enables to install malware on
your system. Check the address

229
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.960 
in the browser address
bar and if it looks,

230
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.260 
if it looks difficult
then do not click on it.

231
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.530 
Common browsers meanwhile
also often warn

232
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.590 
against known

233
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.780 
phishing websites.

234
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.620 
Let's summarize. Let's summarize
what we discussed about social

235
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.990 
engineering attacks
against users. So the

236
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.530 
attack tactics is that
attackers manipulate,

237
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.970 
exploit human weaknesses and
build trust with the victim to

238
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.210 
initiate certain behaviors. For example,
to publish sensitive information

239
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:12.260 
or to install malicious software
which helps the attackers

240
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.850 
to get access to your system
or to get access to your

241
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.690 
secret data like
passwords or others.

242
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.260 
Common procedures for such attacks
is to send fraudulent emails or

243
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.630 
sneaky phone calls.

244
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.840 
A special form of this
phishing attacks,

245
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.670 
especially dangerous form is spear
phishing. This personalised phishing.

246
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:45.260 
Here the attacker focus
on a specific person

247
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:52.450 
and collects, to successfully perform
such an attack, collects detailed

248
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.300 
personal information about the victim
and then misuses this information

249
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:03.840 
in a phishing mail to force the
receiver to do something which

250
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.670 
helps the attacker
later to

251
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:11.050 
step into his system or to get
access to the data of the system.

252
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.570 
This spear phishing needs more
complex preparation but

253
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:24.160 
are much more successful
than these normal

254
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:30.340 
phishing attacks which is sent
a million times to many users.

255
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.170 
This is easier
to detect as phishing.

256
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:38.140 
So this is social engineering
attacks on users

257
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.490 
but social engineering attacks can
also be performed on providers.

258
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.300 
This is what we want to
discuss in our next video.

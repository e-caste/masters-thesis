1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.809 
As every conference comes to the end, it's amazing sharing with

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.579 
you these 2 days, very intense days in which we have been sharing

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.820 
a lot of interesting things.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.539 
We have been engaging very nice keynotes, like the one

5
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.350 
with the Motahhare that ends with very open challenges to everyone and

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.732 
the one by Sanna Jarvela, Geoffrey and all the amazing conversations

7
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.729 
that we all enjoyed and in our in our

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.869 
paper sessions with good chairs that were there and very participant.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.467 
Thank you very much for all the efforts of being away

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.579 
and for those who were awake also at 2 A.M.

11
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.920 
for all the sessions. So it's being very, very, very interesting.

12
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.616 
We had also an engaging poster session in which we have even an elevator and a pool.

13
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.002 
We all enjoyed looking for people and talking and it was very, very

14
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.130 
interesting.

15
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.787 
We have left many open challenges

16
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.009 
in the discussionsin the different sessions.

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.641 
The discussions have been very varied, we have discussed about new methods and techniques

18
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.690 
for learning data analysis with deep learning models

19
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.790 
of what Motahhare was talking about.

20
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.319 
We have been discussing how to identify inequities, and it's very inspiring

21
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.062 
because this last topic goes in this direction.

22
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.280 
We have even talked about how to integrate mobile devices for promoting active learning

23
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.080 
or how to promote active behaviors in online courses.

24
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.740 
All these discussions have been very interesting, but still there is a

25
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.499 
lot, lot of things to explore.

26
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.970 
And now I'm going to hand the mic to Amy

27
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.640 
so, that she can say the last words, thank you very much for being there.

28
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.819 
Thank you, Mar, if you can just change the slides, I think.

29
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.000 
We just wanted to end with a number of thank you's.

30
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.719 
We had amazing session chairs this last two days.

31
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.866 
You really kept the great conversation going and who really kept

32
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.630 
us on track with all of our papers and in this very unusual format.

33
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.069 
Justin, Rene, Pedro, Yannis, and Ken, thank you so much for your support

34
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.840 
of the the event. And also thank you to all of our presenters,

35
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.639 
our work in progress and our full paper presenters and our demos, everyone who

36
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.840 
contributed to this, we know again, it's an odd year, but thanks for

37
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.981 
bearing with us, for submitting videos, for doing all the extra sorts of things

38
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.340 
that one has to do to make a virtual conference work.

39
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.039 
And on that note, we also need to give a major

40
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.509 
thanks to our local chair organizers Thomas and Stephanie and

41
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.489 
all of the rest of the folks at HPI who have kept this technical

42
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.919 
conference running without a hitch.

43
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.370 
I am amazed at how few problems we've had

44
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.669 
in order to actually get all of the details

45
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.779 
of this very intricate dance of of different people and

46
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.150 
technologies and events going on.

47
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.650 
Yes, we'll have a thanks for our

48
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.860 
sponsors, our supporters here, Schmidt Futures and Oracle for research, who

49
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.174 
both helped us select our wonderful paper award winners,

50
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.520 
but also provided a financial incentive that hopefully helps keep them

51
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.520 
afloat and enjoying life.

52
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.649 
And here, in fact, our awards, a Best Paper award

53
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.983 
to "What's in it for the learners, evidence from a randomized field experiment -

54
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.062 
Learnersourcing Questions in a MOOC". We had a wonderful Undergraduate Student

55
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.630 
award of this year on "Student's perceptions of social support in the transition

56
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.219 
to Emergency Remote Instruction".

57
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.434 
And congratulations to you for that, we hope you will continue coming back to Learning

58
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.726 
at Scale year after year. And finally, a really cool Open Data Set

59
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.691 
award, this is the first time this has been awarded for the team that

60
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.999 
really contributed so much to open science and enabling

61
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.116 
other researchers to build on their findings through opening up this extremely large

62
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.339 
dataset that they have to study student learning transactions.

63
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.219 
All right. And with that, we are going to

64
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.959 
introduce you to the final thing for many in conference,

65
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.760 
where are we going to be next year?

66
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.589 
And hopefully this one is one in which we will see you all in person

67
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.060 
with a coffee and a chance to chat face to face.

68
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.190 
So, we're going to turn it over to RenÃ©,

69
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.650 
if we can.

70
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.220 
There we are. Welcome, Rene.

71
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.779 
Hi there. Can you hear me? Yes, in fact, I don't think I can

72
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.839 
turn on my video, but I don't need to.

73
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.429 
I can just tell you that I am extremely excited to announce that Learning

74
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.740 
at Scale next year will be held in New York.

75
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.553 
OK, here we go. I can turn on my video and so I'll let Mar

76
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.569 
click the next slide. So, this is what we are going to be, Cornell Tech is

77
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.412 
on Roosevelt Island, right next door to the city where you

78
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.449 
get the best view of the city really.

79
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.490 
It's a brand new space, has the

80
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.209 
the place where we're going to, where we're going to be in the Verizon Center

81
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.779 
that was just opened for executive education, has a beautiful big new

82
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.370 
lecture hall on the next slide, which it's going to be the main space,

83
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.649 
which we're going to come together next year between June 1st

84
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.089 
and June 3rd. The next slide shows some of the of the inside

85
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.269 
the the reception hall where we'll have

86
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.609 
workshops, where the workshops are going to be held in that space with a view of the

87
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.309 
city. And then the next slide shows where we're going to have a coffee and

88
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.029 
and lunch breaks, which is going to be in the reception, oh the

89
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.195 
reception got lost. This is the hotel which is right on the island, right next to the

90
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.079 
center, it's a beautiful location.

91
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.120 
We're going to have a reception at the rooftop terrace of the hotel overlooking

92
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.589 
New York City. And so, I invite you all to come and join us

93
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.850 
in New York City next year between June 1st and June 3rd.

94
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.602 
I want to also say that there will be an online version of

95
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.760 
the conference for those who cannot make it and will make sure that that

96
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.709 
version is going to be as good as it can be while still having having

97
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.650 
the in-person component. So I look forward to seeing you all

98
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.779 
in person or online next year again.

99
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.799 
And while I have, while I can be here,

100
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.209 
on everybody's behalf, say thank you to our fantastic

101
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.709 
program chairs this year to a fantastic local chairs this year for putting

102
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.839 
together such a great program, you know, despite the difficulties

103
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.339 
of doing it all, it was, I think, one of the the best Learning at Scales we've

104
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.500 
had so far. And I've really enjoyed it, as I'm sure have you.

105
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.510 
So, thank you again.

106
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.980 
Thank you very much to everyone.

107
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.529 
Thank you, Rene. And see you next year in New York, hopefully

108
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.720 
without masks, if possible, and

109
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.870 
we'll have an announcement by Carlos Delgado Kloos for the EMOOCs

110
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.900 
as well.

111
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.287 
Hello, everyone, first, I would like to give also thanks to the

112
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.259 
HPI team for a tremendous organization with

113
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.808 
all uncertainties, first this was going to be a face

114
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.910 
to face, then hybrid, then online all the time.

115
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.009 
So, they have done a tremendous job.

116
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.290 
So a big round of applause to all of them.

117
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.320 
Thank you very much.

118
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.448 
Then I would like to talk about EMOOCs

119
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.009 
and let me share my slides and

120
00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.308 
what is happening with EMOOCs. So, let's look back for a minute.

121
00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.830 
So EMOOCs started in Lausanne, Switzerland in

122
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.470 
2013 - 2014.

123
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.459 
And then we went to to Mons, to Belgium.

124
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.780 
In 2016, it was Graz, Austria.

125
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.340 
Then we went to Spain, to Madrid in 2017, in 2019

126
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.639 
in Naples, Italy. And now in 2021 in Potsdam.

127
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.720 
See that the last two jumps have been two years,

128
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.590 
so two years has passed from 2017 to 2019, from Madrid to Naples

129
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.940 
and from Naples to Potsdam, and we would like to keep this

130
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.590 
timing. So the next EMOOCs will be in

131
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.199 
2023. And we would like to open a call for bids

132
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.660 
for EMOOCs 2023.

133
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.330 
We would like to ask those and there are many countries in Europe that have not

134
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.719 
hosted to EMOOCs. So it's a great opportunity, we have France, we have the Netherlands,

135
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.099 
we have U.K., we have Nordic countries, we have the eastern countries with many countries

136
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.389 
who could be hosting it, were active in the MOOCs area.

137
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.889 
And we would like to ask those who would be willing to

138
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.606 
host it, to send just a proposal, a bit with

139
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.610 
four or five pages, a PDF talking about the relevance

140
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.080 
of the situation and how it is engaged with MOOCs.

141
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.146 
What makes the institution a particular MOOC player?

142
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.740 
We would like to have a proposal about the general chair and

143
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.609 
the organization committee.

144
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.850 
We would like to ask for location dates.

145
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.669 
Where and when would the event be hosted?

146
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.198 
Precisely, is it easy to reach? Is the place attractive?Keeping the main

147
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.330 
rhythm, at the beginning we had different dates, it was in February,

148
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.460 
but we are more or less keeping the May, June and timing.

149
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.829 
And then the financial plans and the activities and

150
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.602 
whether the event would be co-located with any other.

151
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.185 
So, those who would be interested in hosting it, please

152
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.375 
send the proposal to me until the end of the year, until the 31st

153
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.609 
of December 2021, and then a few persons who have been

154
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.320 
active in the EMOOCs conferences and who have hosted previous ones

155
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.919 
would then select the location.

156
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.489 
So, once again, thanks very much to HPI,

157
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.991 
Professor Meinel, Tom, Stephy and all the others who we have not seen

158
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.009 
or have seen partially for such a tremendous job and hope to see you

159
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.320 
not only in Learning at Scale next year, but also in 2 years

160
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.210 
at EMOOCs. Thank you very much.

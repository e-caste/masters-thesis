00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.150 
Design Patterns! You asked for it
and we try to deliver.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.520 
So, what are they? First,
they are not a wall of text

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.550 
and we're going over it really
shortly. So, they originate from

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.570 
architecture, so when we are
talking about Design Patterns, we

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.970 
mean software Design
Patterns; but originally,

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.200 
Design Patterns came from architecture.
There was a famous guy,

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220 
Christopher Alexander, he was professor
at Berkeley in like (inaudible),

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.000 
and he kind of came
up with this

9
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.870 
idea of Design Patterns, how to
build, how to use small parts

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.190 
and connect them in
meaningful ways to solve

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.550 
general problems. And, um, basically
you could say it's

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.320 
a collection of best
practices. Yeah. And he did

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.060 
building, like, concrete
structures, houses, towns, bridges

14
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.770 
whatever. But we will
build software out of these

15
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.310 
same patterns which we will find
out or others found out for

16
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.430 
us. And guess what:
we didn't invent that, so

17
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.840 
there was a couple of people who
worked with that, like in the

18
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.240 
beginning Ward Cunningham
and Kent Beck.

19
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.820 
And later on the Gang
of Four; they sound

20
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.120 
really important, like, "The gang
of four". They wrote

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.040 
a kind of famous book: "The
Bible of Design Patterns".

22
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.890 
I have it here..
This one. No, no shameless
advertising!

23
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.460 
Actually, you don't need to
buy the book. You can,

24
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.230 
but you don't need to. This is more or
less the bible of software

25
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.610 
engineering or at least the
bible of Design Patterns.

26
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.060 
It's just a collection of all the
Design Patterns which are out there,

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.360 
or the most common ones and, well,
kind of those that they collected

28
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.710 
and they kind of thought
to be important.

29
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.820 
Later on other
authors

30
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.260 
took up the same idea and either
rephrased the patterns

31
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.190 
that they are talking about
and put them in a more

32
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.680 
concrete way in, like, the
head-first Design Patterns book,

33
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.060 
or.. It comes with many
examples, very hands-on.

34
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.440 
Or they came up with new patterns,
patterns that they didn't

35
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.600 
think about because some
things like Internet or so

36
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.280 
not really existed back
then in the nineties

37
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.670 
or just came up, so there's
also a series called

38
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
"Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture"
and they have for example

39
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.280 
one book which is dealing particularly
with the Design Patterns

40
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.760 
using in networks
and concurrency

41
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
situations. So there's much material
out there you can do studying

42
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.140 
to just with that but we will
cover a glimpse of it, so the

43
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.590 
most important ones, or
at least the ones we need.

44
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.000 
So what are Design Patterns in
general or how are they structured?

45
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.150 
As the gang of four defines them,
Design Patterns provide

46
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.700 
a solution to a problem in
a context; a pretty

47
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.460 
sentence. A pretty general
sentence, but

48
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.120 
it is what they do and
to make it a bit more

49
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
tangible, each
pattern has name, so we know

50
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.120 
what we talk about, so it's the
Abstract Factory, it's the

51
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.200 
Proxy.. Once again we have a shared
language, a shared vocabulary,

52
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.450 
good thing, repetition. And
then we have a problem.

53
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.040 
A problem is something
that needs to be solved.

54
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.110 
As long as we don't have a solution
a problem might be bad thing,

55
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.150 
but as soon as we have solution
the problem isn't a problem anymore,

56
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.990 
but just a challenge. Yeah, and we
also know that we have a certain

57
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.770 
problem, so we identified it,
so this is a description

58
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.780 
when you could apply this pattern.
If you encounter this problem:

59
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.440 
"Yay!", already solved for you.
Exactly, this pattern solves this problem.

60
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.130 
And then we have, of course,
a description, a

61
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.430 
rather abstract, normally
abstract template

62
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.650 
how to solve the problem and this
is basically some UML diagram

63
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.940 
and a piece of code. And then,
finally, we shouldn't forget

64
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.050 
to talk about consequences when
we apply a certain Design

65
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.020 
Pattern, because it
always comes with a price.

66
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.860 
And not a price tag with
Dollars, or something like that, but,

67
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.770 
yeah, probably you need to implement
some more classes, you need

68
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.270 
another.. association.

69
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.390 
A larger hard drive or
more RAM. It

70
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.550 
comes with a price. The
gang of four kind of structured

71
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.050 
their patterns into.. said
we have different

72
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.940 
sorts of patterns and we have Creational
Patterns, we have Structural

73
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.810 
Patterns and we have
Behavioral Patterns,

74
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.890 
and we will now
come up with

75
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.410 
examples for
each of them.

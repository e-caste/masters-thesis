00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800 
So I'd like to welcome you today here
at the school of design thinking at our

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.120 
building, and since the next
module is all about space,

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.280 
we thought it would be a good idea

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.720 
to meet here and to run through our
space, which we actually had to hack

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.000 
12 years ago when we started.
Because the whole building view was

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.880 
kind of office space it was not
planned to be D-school.

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.640 
And now we're here in one of our studio

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.080 
spaces where you actually can still
see how we did have the space.

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.560 
So down here, you see
that dark gray stripes,

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.240 
this is actually the place where walls

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.960 
have been that actually separated
single offices from each other.

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.960 
And now we're using the whole space here,

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.800 
as you can already see behind
us for our team spaces.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000 
And here we are in one of our team
buildings where you can see our

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.480 
furniture, the tables,
and the whiteboards in action.

16
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.480 
You see it's a little bit of dirt out here.

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.640 
But you see there's the place where you

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.880 
can work and here you can store stuff
and everything is flexible on wheels.

19
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.120 
Even the white boards,
you can move them around and you can

20
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.960 
actually build your own workspace,
which you can see over there.

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.680 
And here you can see how a team uses

22
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.840 
the 3 dimensional space
in order to work together,

23
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.000 
even making use of the windows,
the white walls and also the flexible

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.720 
whiteboards to create
their knowledge space.

25
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.400 
So students are working right now in their

26
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240 
workspaces, and as soon as they're done
in the afternoon, they will actually move

27
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.560 
to the share space where
also everything is movable.

28
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.320 
You see the cubes over there,
you see the chairs,

29
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.480 
it's easy to adjust.

30
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.320 
And this is the stacked version
actually about in the afternoon.

31
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.480 
they will arrange that
for a nice auditorium.

32
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.880 
So here's the other shared space,
which is actually a bit more prepared.

33
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.400 
Now you see the video projector in here
and you see the nicely arranged furniture.

34
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.880 
And here we are in our spacious lounge

35
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.560 
space that we use for informal meetings
in the morning, for example,

36
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.160 
for the participants to do a warmup
altogether,

37
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320 
but also to hang out in breaks,
to have a coffee,

38
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.480 
to have a random encounter with other
teams and other team members.

39
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.320 
So here we are in our
so-called make space.

40
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.120 
We have a lot of boxes with material,
with fabric, with a lot of

41
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.520 
prototyping material with paper and clay,
and all kinds of things.

42
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.240 
And also machinery to cut, for example,
Styrofoam to cut cardboard here,

43
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.960 
and even this sewing machine and this is
also a carton construction board.

44
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.840 
And it's a place where students

45
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.320 
meet for prototyping. And here's even
a prototype of our own product.

46
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.840 
You know, we are using that space also
to prototype tables.

47
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.080 
This is our one of the prototypes
for the hexagon table,

48
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.520 
which is quite heavily used
at the other the other floor.

49
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.920 
And he you see our 3D printer with some

50
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.520 
prints, printouts and,
of course, a legal prototype.

51
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.160 
So here we are at the basement at our
workshop where the students can really

52
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.920 
be a little dirty, saw and hammer
and drill and do all kinds of things.

53
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.480 
And here's a whole wall
of arts and crafts supplies.

54
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.360 
So we hope you have been enjoying our walk
tour, that you gained a couple

55
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.160 
of inspirations about the design thinking
spaces here at the HPI school of

56
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.320 
of Design thinking here in Potsdam.
It gives you also a bit

57
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.120 
of an impression of what you can
do with a normal office space.

58
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.240 
Because it used to be
a normal office space.

59
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.760 
And we are adding here as our props space
where you see all those wigs and hats and all

60
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.320 
kinds of nice clothing stuff,
costumes, which our students are

61
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.920 
also using for prototyping
and playing prototypes.

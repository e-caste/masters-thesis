00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.940 
When we speak in our course about "Half
Century of Internet: How it Works Today"

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.890 
about the internet and the new
digital world, we have a little

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.270 
bit to think about is it
wonderful what's going on?

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.120 
Of course there are many many top
things that are possible, services

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.850 
which are used worldwide. But are all
things wonderful in this new world?

6
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.920 
What is possible? We can have
entertainment, any kind over

7
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.590 
the internet over the world wide web.
We have means for communication,

8
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.540 
for fast communication, for
worldwide communication

9
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.850 
never were available in the world
before. Social media provide

10
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.570 
a new phenomena for the interchange
of information between humans.

11
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.410 
We have access to knowledge
information, digital goods.

12
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.490 
It is so easy to follow this course
here for example this openhpi course

13
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.460 
with any kind of device from
any place in the world and of

14
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.230 
course when we are traveling or
going around as a support we

15
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.100 
get by means of some
navigation system.

16
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.810 
These things are part of our
life no one we're missing it.

17
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.710 
And it's not only in a local place, no.
It's a networking around the world.

18
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.050 
So is the world wide web, the killer
application of the internet.

19
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.840 
It offers everything.

20
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.330 
So we by means of the world wide
web we can get fast and easy

21
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.820 
we can communicate fast and
easy worldwide with a high

22
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.210 
accessibility, its very user
friendly, there are messengers,

23
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.230 
there aresmartphones, there are
different devices which helps

24
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.940 
to in time interconnect with other
people who exchange information.

25
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.480 
So far as an easy the world wide
web provides fast and easy access

26
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.930 
to knowledge, to information, to digital
goods, online libraries, online shops

27
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.110 
are in place everywhere. Networking
over the entire world is possible,

28
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.560 
social media around the world, community
is different, community mediums,

29
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.380 
online project management is possible
or entertaining, the streaming,

30
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.740 
online gaming- these all are provided
by the world wide web. But

31
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.320 
there is also
some dark side.

32
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.270 
Cyber-crime. So here is an
example: fishing mails.

33
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.200 
You get a mail, the sender seems
to be me but if you look more

34
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.200 
careful you see no,
the e-mail address

35
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.900 
comes from someone
else. And this e-mail

36
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.190 
explains you why it's important
that you give in your password

37
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.740 
for example for technical
reason or for others,

38
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.700 
that you have to transfer money
or any kind any bad thing, they

39
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.940 
try to get you
motivated to do.

40
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.950 
And the reason is simple, the web is
open. It is open to everyone also

41
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.460 
to people with bad intentions,
to the cyber criminals.

42
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.520 
So internet is an open network.
This was very important that

43
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.170 
the internet get its
attention it has today.

44
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.740 
The internet has billions
of entry points,

45
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.140 
so is also easy for cybercriminals
to access the internet and to

46
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.490 
do activities in
the internet.

47
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.390 
There are also downsides. If is a
worldwide web and is digital.

48
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.530 
The internet for example
does not forget.

49
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.440 
It does not forget anything.
When you use the internet

50
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.860 
you are leaving traces.

51
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.670 
Traces that are difficult
or impossible to erase.

52
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.830 
The traces are necessary, though
the system needs to recognize

53
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.100 
users at the system for example
if you ask for some information

54
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.950 
you can then back this
information to the right place.

55
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.800 
So internet needs this information,
a log information when

56
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.120 
the request was coming, who was asking
this, what kind of information was sent.

57
00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.960 
All this can be tracked, all
this need to be logged to let

58
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.890 
the machines work
in the right way.

59
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.680 
So there is a huge amount of data,
for example, if you look in

60
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.090 
a for example with google search
engine several things. Then

61
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.250 
your activity can be analyzed and
next time you can without asking

62
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.470 
send, the system can send you the
information you seem to be interested.

63
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.670 
So this analytics of this data
is motivated on one side

64
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.950 
by learning more about you,
by serving better in a way

65
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.370 
but on the other side also
information come into for enhance

66
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.430 
and become aware by such system
which you do not want to

67
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.300 
share with anyone. So data protection
is a very important topic

68
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.970 
we have to consider in the internet.
So for example, imagine.

69
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.550 
You look for a new job as an
adult and then the people asked

70
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.180 
you, "What was in your
young life? You

71
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:18.700 
took part in parties, or
made some images and which

72
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.780 
is not good if you want for
example to have a job of a

73
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.100 
school director or someone else,
or insurances. They know

74
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.800 
what what are the risk you for
what kind of illness you look

75
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.380 
for medicine or for information
in the internet. So all this

76
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
can be analyzed and then so
you will not offer you

77
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.970 
an insurance. Another dark side of
the internet are the fake news.

78
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.590 
It's so easy to communicate
with each other

79
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.030 
and so easy to provide information.
So that is a fake news

80
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.430 
or the wrong information
with a manipulated intent

81
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.980 
are

82
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.910 
published in the
world wide web.

83
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.890 
And due to the high popularity
for example of a social media,

84
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:23.100 
such news which are manipulated which
are published in the social media

85
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.920 
can speed very quickly
and can cause problems.

86
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:35.650 
So users often believe in this messages.
They do not check or question

87
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:43.240 
the truth of the message. So
these messages we say go viral

88
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.840 
if there are shared
by enough users.

89
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:54.550 
So they provide a kind of
reality also they are wrong

90
00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.120 
also as they are manipulated to
reach for example to get impact

91
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.060 
on some political
processes or others.

92
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:10.620 
And the more users such a message
share, the more credible it appears.

93
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.080 
Often as such fake news are done in
connection with political objectives.

94
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:23.650 
For example, before elections to
manipulate to influence elections.

95
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.790 
It is is also called
dis-information campaigns.

96
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.180 
To give a simple example of
such a fake news, there was

97
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.620 
a fake news and
it was spread

98
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.570 
to a large extent among the users
which tells that 5G networks

99
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.300 
cause COVID19 pandemic.

100
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.880 
There have been multiple
misinformation and fake news spread

101
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.490 
around social media about the
pandemic, the COVID19 pandemic

102
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.100 
and one striking example
for such a fake news was

103
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:09.660 
5G net cause the SARS-CoV2
virus to spread and started

104
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.000 
as a COVID19 pandemic. Here is
such a message, such a warning.

105
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.890 
Of course every scientist can
tell the radio waves could not

106
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.780 
and do not transmit any
virus. It's not possible.

107
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.450 
They have been proven
in multiple studies.

108
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.330 
Nevertheless such a fake news
many people take it as it is.

109
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:41.600 
So we need and this is not only
in this context with COVID19

110
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.730 
but also in other context we need to
verify any information we receive

111
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:53.650 
with information from trusted and
from trusted and official sources

112
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.780 
such as World Health Organization
or Government or others.

113
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.700 
So the people need
to be careful

114
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:09.660 
with regard to the information that
can be got from the internet.

115
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.550 
Cyber bullying is
another dark side.

116
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:21.410 
Deliberately insulting, threatening,
exposing or harassing other people

117
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.180 
using modern means
of communication.

118
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:32.710 
So that is many internet platforms
offer the users an opportunity to act

119
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.430 
under anonymous
identity

120
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:42.740 
and then people do things which probably
they would not do when their name

121
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.780 
would appear. But as soon
as they are anonymous

122
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.130 
say try to do some mobbing with
another person to say some bad

123
00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:00.110 
things about other persons or for
other parties or other institutions.

124
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.240 
So pseudonyms and nicknames
typically are used

125
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.810 
for a physical person in
the digital world to

126
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:18.890 
hide the identity. So people can have
many different digital identities

127
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.110 
and can do with a different identities
different things particularly

128
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.460 
it's interesting for people
whose bad ideas and which want

129
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.570 
to do bad activities.

130
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:38.750 
So anonymity lowers the threshold for
aggressive behavior, for negative comments.

131
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:47.310 
Here are some statistics where
are people cyber-bullying.

132
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.880 
There is a statistic and you see here
the percentage in twitter is about

133
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.730 
ten percent, youtube ten percent,
whatsapp twelve, but snapchat,

134
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:05.370 
facebook, instagram much more
much bigger number of wrong

135
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.200 
fraud messages to harm other people,
to say something bad about

136
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.190 
what's called this
cyber-bullying.

137
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:22.140 
Cyber bullying copyright. This is
another problem in the internet. It's

138
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.520 
the right to protect
intellectual property

139
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.270 
in ideal and
material terms

140
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.600 
and the digital world in the digital
world digitalisation has changed

141
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:42.660 
something in this era. Today it's very
easy in the internet to replicate

142
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:49.750 
information, to
duplicate say

143
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:57.690 
publications to a copy in
credentials, receipts,

144
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:04.840 
of materials, the design plans
and others. So it's much easier

145
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:11.920 
one can do this anonymous. So data
piracy becomes a real problem.

146
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.540 
The illegal distribution
of a copyright material.

147
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:23.610 
Partly it's done without
malicious intent. For example

148
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.270 
the usage on an image or in logo
in an own presentation, people

149
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.820 
do not think about that this image or
this logo, that they are copyright.

150
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.650 
And that it's not easily
possible to simply to copy it.

151
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.530 
But of course some people do it
to steal the information. For

152
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.790 
example in the pharmaceutical
industries to steal the recipient

153
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.560 
of a drug or design
materia of a car.

154
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.620 
So this open internet

155
00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.490 
provides many many very
valuable services,

156
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.080 
but also provides some risk
in different content.

157
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.450 
Last i want to discuss a open
internet versus dark net.

158
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:20.860 
So in the open internet nothing
happens unnoticed. Each user

159
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.950 
has its own IP address and this
IP address can be traced back

160
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:32.480 
to a location, to the terminal
device the user is using

161
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:37.750 
and so it can be tracked what the
user is doing, what he is he

162
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.040 
when he's serving in the web which
website he is visiting and others.

163
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.210 
So as the darknet is

164
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:54.670 
a technique to access the
internet in anonymity,

165
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.950 
so the connection between the
computers using the internet

166
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:06.590 
by means of special technology
it becomes no more possible to

167
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.250 
trace back the address of the user.
So the darknet offers advantage

168
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:20.450 
of being anonymous
but also offers

169
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:28.620 
a disadvantage that criminals can misuse these
technologies, these darknet technologies.

170
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.830 
So the good side when we
speak about darknet

171
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:37.290 
is the anonymous and protected
communication. So for example

172
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:43.920 
with this people can be protected
in autocratic states when

173
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:49.120 
they express their opinion which
is not official opinion. So

174
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:55.490 
a human right activist
can publish their

175
00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:01.040 
ideas, their protests,
their messages

176
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.160 
with the protection of the anonymity
that's provided by the darknet.

177
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.370 
But the bad side of course is also
criminal people can do this.

178
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:18.020 
So the darknet there's a biggest
black market on the world.

179
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.590 
You can buy drugs, weapons,
child pornography

180
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:28.860 
there and why? The cybercriminals
feel secure because of this

181
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:35.510 
anonymity. So the risk to be detected
is much lower than in the internet.

182
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:45.970 
These are the usage of the internet.
What we want to cover in the course

183
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.100 
when we speak about the internet?
We speak about the the

184
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.900 
internet is working, we will speak
about internet applications

185
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.720 
to understand the techniques behind
or speak about world wide web,

186
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:05.830 
email, social media, email streaming, we
will speak about internet security,

187
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:11.160 
What are the motivation for cyber crime
and what are the techniques they use,

188
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.890 
what is was digital identities, what
kind of security measures are needed

189
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.950 
if you move in
the internet

190
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:25.690 
but for all this aspects there
are also other courses,

191
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.970 
openhpi courses, which will
discuss these aspects in

192
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.590 
in depth. So for example there is
a course "Cybersecurity Basics".

193
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:42.550 
This goes much deeper into the question of data
security, digital identities, blockchain,

194
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:49.370 
security even without a trust
centre, you can do this although

195
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.960 
there is another course about
"Trolls, Hate and Fake News",

196
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:58.770 
how we can save the internet. So
here in our course we will discuss

197
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.780 
all those topics.
When you

198
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:07.120 
get interested in learning more
details about it, look through the

199
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:13.150 
different offers on openhpi. there
are a lot of courses which deepen

200
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:18.750 
some of the aspects we would speak
here, we would speak about in our

201
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.070 
course "Half Century of
Internet: How it Works Today".

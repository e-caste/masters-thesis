00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.260 
i know everyone. this is antonella portugal from university

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.830 
more than i read your media.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.390 
how introduce you this presentation

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.240 
which has been carried out and realised together with other two colleagues

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.630 
maria badia it and marveling from university roma.

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.910 
so what are we going to talk about

7
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.720 
within this session.

8
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.880 
the use of mox and we are saying the field of heritage education

9
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.680 
as increased in the last decade especially during the spread

10
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.030 
of the covered nineteen pandemic.

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.950 
the main reasons could be possibly

12
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.810 
related to the need to reach many users and to promote communication

13
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
of artistic and cultural heritage as stated by the experiences of the

14
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.100 
new york moma in

15
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.850 
two thousand thirteen. and the museum studies centre of the

16
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.440 
university of leicester in two thousand fifteen which highlighted the

17
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.210 
importance of such a methodology for the development of content relative

18
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.240 
to the field of museum and university didactics.

19
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.530 
moreover, the recent italian ministerial regulations in education

20
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.090 
through the guidelines for integrated digital education and the digital

21
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.820 
school national plan

22
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.550 
define as necessary the creation of educational pathways

23
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.540 
employing yards and at the same time training courses for

24
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
in training teachers and education.

25
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.470 
educators in formal and informal educational contexts

26
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.220 
starting from these assumptions. the centre for museum studies

27
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.950 
based at university roma with

28
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.340 
the support of researchers from the intellect centre

29
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.590 
from the university of modern range emilia

30
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.910 
designed and implemented a series of online activities with

31
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.940 
and for students of the pedagogical

32
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.870 
education degree aiming to study the characteristics of yards

33
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.580 
and marks in the former and in former education field

34
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.820 
discover their sexualities for the promotion of the artistic

35
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.030 
and cultural heritage and develop

36
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.380 
of course transverse knowledge and skills in the field of distance

37
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.770 
learning and museum education.

38
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.790 
museum education teaching methodologies for the promotion of

39
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.310 
transverse skills. in heritage context was initially developed

40
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.950 
in the academic year two thousand and sixteen two thousand.

41
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.080 
and seventeen by about seventy students of the bachelor's degree in educational science

42
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.010 
during the museum education and critical technology landed

43
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.960 
internship organized by the centre for museum studies.

44
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.510 
all the materials were then evaluated and reviewed

45
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.240 
by the internship tutors and in september two thousand and eighteen the move

46
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.110 
assumed its final structure divided in six

47
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.420 
modules eventually. it was uploaded on the center for museum

48
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.990 
studies moodle platform which is completely accessible and free

49
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.890 
starting from the academic year two thousand and eighteen nineteen

50
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.330 
to two thousand and twenty twenty-one and a total of thirty

51
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.850 
seven students as attended the move through the center for

52
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.410 
museum studies moodle platform those students were then asked

53
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.430 
to rate the contents and characteristics of each module

54
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.960 
by using an evaluation tool specifically created for the experience.

55
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.950 
the evaluation tool was realized to stimulate the students'

56
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.950 
analysis and reflection skills and their ability to critically evaluate the online

57
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.080 
educational resources.

58
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.960 
the first one aims to assess the structure

59
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.410 
of the sub mooc in terms of learning by the way design.

60
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.760 
self evaluation skills promotion is used is useful of course to self assess

61
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.550 
a transverse competencies.

62
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.060 
self-evaluation learning aims to assess the quality of learning

63
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.650 
in terms of expectation and clarity of learning instructions.

64
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.970 
the fourth micro indicator focuses on the technical aspects of all yards

65
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.510 
and the last one evaluates the clarity and comprehensiveness of content

66
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.750 
having a look on the main results. we can see that the evaluation

67
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.420 
data on the first micro indicator are very positive especially

68
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.720 
on the assessment reports. and that's consistency indicator

69
00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.460 
on average nineteen out of thirty seven students appreciated the

70
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.810 
consistency of the evaluation test.

71
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.320 
the clear definition of the learning objectives and the presence

72
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.810 
of practical examples of specific teaching methodologies in

73
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.810 
the context of artistic and cultural heritage

74
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.050 
a second macro indicator shows very satisfactory evaluation

75
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.740 
data for almost all the transverse skills mentioned especially evaluation and innovation

76
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.610 
which were nearly always scored a five or four.

77
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.700 
these skills are referable to the construct

78
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.970 
of critical thinking

79
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.660 
showing the attainment of the online course objectives by the students.

80
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.770 
the communication and creativity skills are also evaluated positively.

81
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.810 
the lowest self-evaluation scores were given to problem solving

82
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.670 
on average eleven students assigned a score free to the skill.

83
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.840 
and that could be due to the absence of individual and group

84
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.590 
activities based on problem solving methodologies in the field

85
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.920 
of museum. and heritage education another interesting outcome is that

86
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:26.100 
some results of the transversal skills self assessment are closely related.

87
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.380 
specifically innovation shows a strong positive correlation

88
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.970 
with creativity skills. r equals point eighty three and communication skills.

89
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.520 
r equal to point eighty three

90
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.070 
fully satisfactory her were also the results of the learning

91
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:54.420 
self-evaluation learning process highlighting the clearness of the indications

92
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.210 
provided and the grad

93
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.260 
quality of the acquisition of knowledge

94
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.210 
although further implementations must be made about the quantity

95
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.870 
of contents proposed in the course since then students agreed

96
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.970 
that more indications regarding on-line activities would have been needed

97
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.090 
in conclusion the opportunity to participate in a mooc on museum.

98
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:27.460 
education to evaluated through a specific evaluation tool

99
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.790 
made it possible for students to reach three

100
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:39.720 
kind of outcomes. first increase professional skills their professional

101
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.910 
skills such as their specific knowledge

102
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:50.570 
of museum education and an answer of the pedagogical reflection ability on learning

103
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:57.590 
materials. second the growth of a transversal skills like innovation creativity

104
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:03.280 
communication and implementation third design of new pathways

105
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.370 
that need to be implemented during

106
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.360 
the following and next pilot phase of the moca

107
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.680 
lodging the number of users and identifying the most evident

108
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.500 
elements that need modification of intervention.

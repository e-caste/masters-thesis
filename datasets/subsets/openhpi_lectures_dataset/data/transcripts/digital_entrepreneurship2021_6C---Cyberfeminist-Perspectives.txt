1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.280 
So, what role do digital technologies
play for female entrepreneurs?

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.660 
Does it or does it not make a
difference for female entrepreneurs

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.590 
if they integrate digital technologies
into their business models?

4
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.260 
Welcome back. For this session Valeska and I
will talk about "Cyberfeminist Research"

5
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.800 
and give you an idea about the
recent findings and discussions.

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.160 
Digital technologies and their role in
female entrepreneurship have sparked

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.250 
quite some interest
in entrepreneurship.

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
A majority of the related research studying
the relation between female entrepreneurship

9
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.970 
and digital technologies is coined
as "cyberfeminist research".

10
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.080 
With the rise of the internet and the
birth of many new digital technologies

11
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.390 
researchers have especially sought to
understand if digital entrepreneurship

12
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.340 
can function as an equalizer and level the
playing field for female entrepreneurs.

13
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.810 
Digital developments could increase
work flexibility, provides easier

14
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
access to knowledge, or improve
business or funding opportunities.

15
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.680 
Over time, two central opposite
perspectives concerning the

16
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.450 
role of digital entrepreneurship
for female entrepreneurs

17
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.310 
have developed. While some
researchers find that the online

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.720 
cyberspace provides
emancipatory potential,

19
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.310 
others argue that the challenges
of female entrepreneurs are

20
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.630 
simply mirrored in
the online context.

21
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.740 
Researchers supporting the first
perspective argue that digital

22
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.970 
entrepreneurship offers an emancipatory
potential for female entrepreneurs

23
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.170 
by creating a safe space on the internet
for them to follow their business ideas

24
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.130 
and that digital technologies provide
new entrepreneurial opportunities.

25
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.250 
They argue that this observation,
for example, applies to women

26
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.650 
living in restrictive cultural
and social environments.

27
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.450 
Digital entrepreneurship can
facilitate emancipation from the

28
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.900 
constraints in a formal context
such as laws and regulations

29
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.680 
and in an informal context such
as social and cultural norms.

30
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.410 
Maura McAdam and her colleagues
analyzed in their study the

31
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.630 
use of digital technologies and the experience,
challenges throughout the entrepreneur process

32
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.890 
by conducting interviews with female
entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia.

33
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.050 
The authors found that the online context
for the interviewed female entrepreneurs

34
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.480 
represented a safe space where they felt
empowered and their businesses could flourish.

35
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.120 
Further, they observed that socio-cultural
norms and expectation towards women

36
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.020 
could make it more difficult for them
to find employment in some sectors.

37
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.050 
The digital context and
remote working situation

38
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.730 
offered the women new opportunities
that they otherwise probably

39
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.480 
could have not been
able to follow.

40
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.480 
The women described that they challenged
socio-cultural norms and felt empowered

41
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.770 
by following these
entrepreneurial opportunities.

42
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.420 
A further recent study by
Pergelova et al. emphasises that

43
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.010 
digital infrastructure can enable
the internationalisation

44
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.500 
of women led businesses.

45
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.660 
The authors show that digital technologies
present an emancipatory and democratising

46
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.180 
potential for female entrepreneurs
because they lower market

47
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.480 
barriers and allow for

48
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.680 
increased exchange in an
international setting.

49
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.690 
The use of digital technologies can enable
the growth of female-led businesses.

50
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.880 
However, context matters.

51
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.180 
Researchers argue that the emancipatory
potential of entrepreneurship

52
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.460 
always depends on the nature of barriers
experienced by the female entrepreneurs.

53
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.710 
Further, it has been criticized that
little research on cyberfeminism

54
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.590 
has been conducted beyond
developing economies.

55
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.180 
The second perspective, then, challenges
the emancipatory potential of the role

56
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.840 
of digital technologies
for female entrepreneurs.

57
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.590 
Researchers argue that possible
gender biases or inequalities

58
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.430 
experienced in the offline context are
simply reflected in an online context.

59
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.790 
Studies show that female entrepreneurs
barriers such as difficult

60
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.090 
access to funding and resources
or social positioning

61
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.330 
are mirrored in the
online world. Meaning,

62
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.410 
the emancipatory potential of
entrepreneurship cannot be fully

63
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.650 
supported by
the findings.

64
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.570 
An empirical study by Angela
Martinez Dy and her colleagues

65
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.970 
published in 2018
questions the emancipatory

66
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.050 
potential of digital technologies
to overcome structure barriers.

67
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.040 
In their research, they surveyed
female digital entrepreneurs

68
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.170 
from the United Kingdom and found that
the emancipatory potential depends

69
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.750 
on the social positioning
of the individual, meaning,

70
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.520 
successful digital entrepreneurship
is either facilitated or

71
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.860 
obstructed by structural or
cultural contextual factors.

72
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.760 
All in all, this debate on digital
entrepreneurship and its emancipatory potential

73
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.100 
shows that this topic needs
further research in the future.

74
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.330 
Recent research calls for more
studies in developed economies

75
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.750 
to test the hypotheses in more diverse
regulatory and social contexts

76
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.480 
to gain deeper insights.

77
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.550 
We have included the references to the
mentioned studies and the supported material.

78
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.690 
Of course, female entrepreneurship is
only one research field of many

79
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.300 
to spotlight and study a specific
group of entrepreneurs.

80
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.390 
For example, another popular research stream is migrant
entrepreneurship or immigrant entrepreneurship.

81
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.870 
Its goal is to understand possible motivations
and barriers for immigrant entrepreneurs.

82
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.240 
For this openHPI course, we chose to talk
about female entrepreneurship,

83
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.480 
to shed some light on how bias can
affect entrepreneurial intentions

84
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.490 
to start an own business and the entrepreneur
success in pursuing a business idea

85
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.460 
depending on
your gender.

86
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.640 
As entrepreneurship researchers,
we are interested in the role

87
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:18.160 
of bias as such and hopefully could use the
particular stream of female entrepreneurship

88
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.860 
to point to the implications of biases
for entrepreneur research and practice.

89
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.670 
We hope, for our coming conversations,
we will get a chance to look at

90
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.510 
further nuances regarding the rich
diversity of different entrepreneurs.

91
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.270 
Robert and I hope that you enjoy
this dive into a fast-growing

92
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.510 
research field within entrepreneurship
and that you could develop

93
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.990 
an understanding of how digital technologies
can or cannot emancipate female entrepreneurs.

94
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.950 
We look forward to seeing you
in our next video. See you.

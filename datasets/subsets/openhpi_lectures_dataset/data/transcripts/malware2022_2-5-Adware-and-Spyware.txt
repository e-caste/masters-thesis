00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.760 
In our openHPI course Cyberthreats by Malware,
now we consider Adware and Spyware.

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.190 
Adware - that's malware that display
advertisements, so called ads,

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340 
in addition to their actual functionality.

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.940 
So most often such adware
is installed within the browser,

5
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.810 
within the web browser disguised as genuine
or legitimate programming or plugin.

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.620 
And it shows some deceptive
flashing or pop up advertisements

7
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.900 
on any website
to the user.

8
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.880 
But it's not only
juggling such adware,

9
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.140 
it could also trick users to install
malware or unwanted software

10
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.750 
or to go to
fake phishing

11
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.740 
websites. So it could be a
start of something more

12
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.490 
dangerous that the users
are forced to install

13
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.470 
unknown malware
or software.

14
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.800 
In most cases such
adware is harmless.

15
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.990 
It also can easy be removed. However it
could be very annoying for the users.

16
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.960 
So here it's important
it is the first

17
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.270 
impression, annoying to see
everytime such advertisements but

18
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.790 
it could be even more dangerous by
forcing people, tricking people

19
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.370 
to install malware or go
to a phishing website.

20
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.020 
Let's consider some examples. For
example the netware fireball.

21
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.640 
Fireball was in two
thousand seventeen

22
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.840 
a really very well

23
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.230 
distributed adware over
the internet. It infected

24
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.110 
two hundred fifty million
computers and devises and twenty

25
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.110 
percent of the cooperate
networks worldwide.

26
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
The fireball spread mostly by
unknowingly installing the adware

27
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.220 
alongside a genuine program.

28
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.730 
So it came with the program, the
program the user wants to install

29
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.840 
the program and he got
on top this adware.

30
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.430 
And is the functionality of the
fireball was that the web browser

31
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.650 
was hijacked so it was hijacked and then
it was the default search engine,

32
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.860 
it was changed to
a fake malicious

33
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.260 
search engine. And this is of
course dangerous because in this

34
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.290 
fake malicious search
engine, when the user

35
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.770 
went to this - when the user
goes to such a website -

36
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.790 
and clicks anything,

37
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.690 
then addition malware is
installed and the other

38
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.020 
thing that was done with the hijacked
web browser by this fireball

39
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.750 
was to track users'
web activities,

40
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.510 
to understand and to sell the data, to
create profiles user profiles and others.

41
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.330 
This fireball was capable of executing
malicious code on victims machines.

42
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
So dropping additional malware
on the computer to steal

43
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360 
victim's credentials, passwords and others.

44
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.440 
So this was
really a danger.

45
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.090 
Many Adware examples are not
so dangerous but in any case

46
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.130 
you see that even if it
only sounds that it's

47
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.170 
doing and showing advertisements,
it could be very dangerous

48
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.500 
by forcing people to install
malware or by doing it by itself.

49
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.070 
Another type of malware is spyware.

50
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.500 
It's a little bit similar.
Here the idea is

51
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.940 
to re-call and steal confidential
information of the victims.

52
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.730 
so to learn and to understand
what he's doing, what it is,

53
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.110 
and if the victim
for example is a

54
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.030 
designer or constructor or a manager
in a big company or it is a

55
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.070 
political responsible person, then with
such malware, the attacker gets access

56
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.130 
to the information that
these people are processing

57
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.590 
and to the work they are
doing on their computer.

58
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.140 
This spyware could be installed when
installing a seemingly legitimate

59
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.840 
software or by exploiting
vulnerabilities in the system.

60
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.910 
So either it comes in a package with
program and software that looks

61
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.700 
okay, or by exploiting a
vulnerability in the system in the

62
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.390 
software that's installed
on the computer to

63
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.350 
infect the system with
such a spyware software.

64
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.720 
The spyware software
typically run quietly

65
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.330 
in the background process, guesses
the information about the user.

66
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.330 
So his emails, banking details, user
name password combination -,

67
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.420 
in a way that the user is not aware that
all this information are spied out

68
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.130 
that they are recorded and are
later sent to the cyber attackers

69
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:11.170 
or that all this activities become
known to the cyber attackers

70
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.090 
and can be
misused by them.

71
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.330 
They collect the data about the victim's
activities. They, of course, could be misused

72
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.190 
or often cyber criminals try
to make money out of it,

73
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.500 
to sell this
information

74
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.140 
without a content of the victim
for example in the darknet

75
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.330 
or to a data centre or to
an intelligence service

76
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.270 
or to some
agency abroad.

77
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.020 
To give an example, I
will give an example

78
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.190 
from our daily life, the example
is Spyware DarkHotel.

79
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.570 
The idea was here with the spyware
to target high profile people

80
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.710 
which are on a business trip,
which are staying in a hotel,

81
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.350 
whether it's business executives
or government leaders.

82
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.410 
The people when they come into the
hotel, of course they use the wi-fi

83
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:27.440 
from the hotel. So what does attacker do?
They first inject malware to the hotel's

84
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.340 
server before the victim
arrives at the hotel

85
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.610 
and as soon as
the victim,

86
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.270 
the high profile person connects
to the hotel's wi-fi,

87
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.810 
the attacker performs a
spear phishing attack

88
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.670 
to mislead the victim to
install the spyware.

89
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.580 
This DarkHotel
spyware uses several

90
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.100 
malware components to gain access
to the system and then to be

91
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.340 
able to steal sensitive
information

92
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.180 
of the system of the
victim. And then finally

93
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.000 
the attacker deletes the malware
from the hotel server

94
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.410 
and network to avoid
getting detected.

95
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:23.610 
So afterward no one knows how was it
possible for the attacker to get access

96
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.090 
to this information. This is a
scenario, typically these high

97
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:35.250 
profile people belong to a company or to a
government organization with a professional

98
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:42.760 
IT security management of their systems but
in such a hotel, when they are traveling

99
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.200 
then it's much easier
for the cyber attackers

100
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:56.230 
to install here such a spyware,
this DarkHotel spyware on the

101
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:02.810 
systems of the hotel. And then to
misuse this to attack the user.

102
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.740 
What are protective measures
against Adware and Spyware?

103
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.310 
You should generally pay
attention to what you click

104
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.370 
and what you download.
If you click a link,

105
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.190 
for example to an
unknown website

106
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.920 
it could be a malicious
website, the click could

107
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.110 
result in the download of the
malware. And if you download some

108
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.900 
for what you are, what
people offer you,

109
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.860 
then also you need to be aware that
in the software you are downloading

110
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.470 
also hidden malicious
software.

111
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.930 
It could be hidden - particularly
such adware and spyware software.

112
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:54.320 
Do not install programs from unknown
sources, exactly for that reason that

113
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.930 
the software could be infected.

114
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.050 
Already do not click on links
from suspicious emails

115
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.810 
and in case of doubt, inform
yourself beforehand whether the

116
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:15.600 
program is a legitimate program, a
genuine program or whether the source

117
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.900 
of this is a trustworthy source.

118
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.970 
Then another protective measure is
when installing programs, make sure

119
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.890 
that not unwanted free tools are
installed at the same time.

120
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.670 
This is an usual trick that
the cybercriminals often use

121
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:46.190 
very useful seeming free tools
and in reality there is

122
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:51.620 
not such a tool, it is malware or
at least it is malware hidden

123
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:58.480 
in that free tools. And such free tools
often can change during the installation

124
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.690 
process or be voted
out and

125
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:10.450 
cyber attackers can get access to
your computer to do wrong things.

126
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:16.080 
And then you should use anti-virus scanner,
you should use anti malware scanner

127
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:24.620 
to detect and remove malware
if the cybercriminals managed to

128
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.680 
install malware
on your system.

129
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.950 
In particular, for the
advertisements there are

130
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.930 
ad-blockers available to prevent
that in the web browser

131
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.570 
the advertisement is showing. One
can stop it with this software,

132
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.440 
but also here you should
be very careful

133
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:52.770 
to select a trustworthy ad blocker not
that under the label of an ad blocker,

134
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:59.500 
you install such additional adware
or spyware on your computer.

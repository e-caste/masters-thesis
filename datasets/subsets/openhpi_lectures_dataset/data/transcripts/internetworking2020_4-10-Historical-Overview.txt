00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.300 
Finishing the fourth week of our OpenHPI
course a half-century of internet

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.510 
We want to have a short
historical overview of

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.410 
the development of the internet.
You remember the internet

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.330 
starts in 1969, so this was the
birth year of the ARPANET

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.870 
ARPANET was run with the TCP/IP
protocols, we know it today.

6
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.330 
And then last year 2019 we had 50
years celebration of the internet.

7
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.710 
Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf are two
very important persons in the

8
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.370 
development of the internet, in
the history of the internet.

9
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.980 
Many people call them the fathers of the
internet and the reason was that they

10
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.230 
in 1973

11
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.890 
came up with a new model of
a higher abstraction layer

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.820 
of the interconnection of
the physical networks

13
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.320 
so they designed a protocol tcp
ip protocol originally this

14
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.470 
was a one protocol which over the
time provided this protocol stack

15
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.810 
we know him today nineteen seventy
for the first tcp standard

16
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.680 
it was he introduced it was cool it was called
in the network transmission control protocol

17
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.540 
in the rf c six hundred seventy
five and then uh uh four years

18
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.460 
later in nineteen seventy eight tcp and
ip were separated from each other

19
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.160 
so this was an important step a later
on a both protocols are standardized

20
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.760 
in the rfc seven thousand ninety
one and tcp in the rcp is seventy

21
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.880 
seven ninety three and this is the
situation and the protocols we know today

22
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.560 
some a tcp a was he continued
he developed an improved

23
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.170 
but uh this is the internet with the
protocol steak as we know him today

24
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.200 
nineteen eighty three arpanet was
completely converted to tcp ip

25
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.830 
a protocol world so the original
a protocols were dropped and

26
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.520 
then in the same year the civil
part and the military part

27
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.900 
of the internet
where separated

28
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.620 
as there was a upon it was
separated in the several internet

29
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.380 
and a military net and a few years later the
military internet was completely closed

30
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.450 
another historical a view back is on the
history of the transport layer security tls

31
00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.580 
we discussed about it that is is
a base requirement to making

32
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.930 
calls to make all this business possible
in the internet we know today

33
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.330 
tls provides security mechanisms
for authentication four a four

34
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.100 
e four a encryption of data
securing data in this way

35
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.200 
and also security measures. So this
was a development I mentioned,

36
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.410 
it would start with the
netscape which became famous.

37
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.960 
It was a start-up out of a university,
the university developed

38
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.050 
the first browser Netscape, then as a
company a developed to a product.

39
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.580 
So Netscape came 1994 with the
first edition of SSl 1.0,

40
00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.590 
is a secure socket layer, which
later on was transferred

41
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.400 
into a new standard,
TLS 1.0.

42
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.130 
The version 3.1,

43
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.150 
this was then defined and
standardized as TLS1.0 and

44
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.460 
nowadays a TLS 1.3 is in place
and this was invented in 2018.

45
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.320 
So these are important dates for
the development in the internet.

46
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:44.270 
and here we spoke this week about the
protocols on the transport layer.

47
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.900 
So we now know how internet
packages are transferred, we know

48
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.930 
how connection and reliable service is
provided for transmission in the internet.

49
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.170 
So in the next two weeks, we will
speak about application level

50
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.580 
about internet application and about
a it's a secure usage of such data.

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.859 
This is part of the Future of Computing - POWER9 and beyond lecture

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.387 
series, and this topic will be about Linux on POWER.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.669 
There's two parts to this. And the first part I'll be talking about Linux on POWER

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.349 
in general, how Linux is built and collaboration between the open-source

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.929 
community and Linux distributors and IBM.

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.549 
And in the second part, I'll be focussing on software development for Linux

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.550 
on POWER.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.019 
A little bit of background to my person.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.489 
My name is Ulrich Weigand and I am a member of

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.749 
the IBM Linux Technology Centre based in the IBM Germany Research and Development Lab in

11
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.969 
Böblingen. My background is with open-sourcecompilers and toolchain

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.589 
across various IBM platforms, including IBM POWER and the mainframe.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.449 
And I'm also part of the open-source

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.129 
community, myself as a maintainer in GCC, LLVM

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.330 
and also GDB.

16
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.979 
The first part will be about Linux on POWER and

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.395 
its use in the enterprise.

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.049 
Now Linux is Unix like operating system with the

19
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.789 
source code being readily available. It was originally written in 1991 by Linus

20
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.309 
Torvalds. It operates on virtually any platform, including the IBM machines,

21
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.589 
and it is developed by the open-sourcecommunity.

22
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.459 
But it is generally acquired in particular for a large enterprise users

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.249 
on a subscription basis from a Linux

24
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.019 
distributor, including SUSE, Read Hat or Canonical,

25
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.120 
who provide the Ubuntu distributions.

26
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299 
But the development of both the Linux kernel, the toolchain and most of the

27
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.739 
applications that form part of the Linux distribution is done by a

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.560 
variety of open source communities.

29
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.739 
But IBM is part of these communities,

30
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.209 
IBM's investment in open source has started nearly

31
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.952 
20 years ago with a few people contributing to Linux, Apache,

32
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.019 
the core compilers and some of the core packages, and from then it has

33
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.133 
grown rapidly and we have now

34
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.969 
tens of thousands IBMers contributing to hundreds of open source

35
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.819 
packages, including those on the chart, but I could have filled

36
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.379 
the chart with many more.

37
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.049 
Specifically talking about the Linux kernel, the core tools.

38
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.859 
This is the organisation that I'm a part of, the IBM Linux Technology Centre.

39
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.449 
Like the open community itself, we are organised as a worldwide

40
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.429 
organisation with many locations in different countries, including

41
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.305 
one right here in Germany, Böblingen.

42
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.829 
Linux development itself works in

43
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.879 
a community way, which is where the community is organising

44
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.899 
itself, so we have in the Linux kernel we have this core maintainer is obviously Linus

45
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.789 
Torvalds himself, who is supported by a number of maintainers

46
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.399 
for various subsystems of Linux kernels.

47
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.109 
These subsystems could include filesystems, memory management,

48
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.879 
disk I/O, device drivers, network drivers and platform-specific

49
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.619 
code. And those maintainers in turn receive

50
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.539 
contributions from a variety of Linux developers.

51
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.039 
Working on Linux just as a hobby or working to

52
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.839 
support Linux on behalf of a major corporation, and that includes IBM.

53
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.609 
So our Linux developers, we are IBMers, but we are also

54
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.869 
part of the open-sourcecommunity, and that includes the kernel community as shown on this

55
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.609 
chart. But just the same holds for the communities around many of the other important

56
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.169 
open source projects, including GCC compiler and many

57
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.869 
other projects.

58
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.909 
Now, the source code that is being developed in this manner

59
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.099 
is available to the general public is made available by Linus Torvalds,

60
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.899 
us, open-source. The source code is there.

61
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.239 
The Linux distributors, including Red Hat, SUSE and Canonical.

62
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.369 
Take that source code, package it sometimes at their own

63
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.259 
enhancements to it and make it available as products

64
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.819 
which run across a variety of platforms, including the two

65
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.105 
big IBM platforms, IBM POWER and IBM Z.

66
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.865 
Now, as I mentioned Linux on

67
00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:58.389 
POWER is not an IBM product, but you can get

68
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.919 
it from IBM and you can get support for it from IBM.

69
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.359 
And the way this works is that we operate as a reseller for the

70
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.009 
Linux distributions. We cooperate with both the three distributions.

71
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.479 
I mentioned, SUSE, Red Hat and Canonical, and we also cooperate with those same

72
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.219 
three distributions on a maintenance

73
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.739 
and support side.

74
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.869 
So an IBM customer who is already has IBM support,

75
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.369 
let's say, for example, for the hardware or for the virtualisation solution, can, as part

76
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.600 
of that same IBM support contract, also purchase support subscription for Linux,

77
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.379 
which we in the end will then work together with the distribution partners

78
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.089 
to track down problems, create fixes and via

79
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.889 
the distribution partner, make those fixes available then to the customer in turn

80
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.049 
as part of the corporation. If other customers of that distribution partner

81
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.549 
run into problems on IBM machines SUSE, Red Hat and Canonical will

82
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.373 
work with us and the experts in our Linux technology center

83
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.649 
to likewise create fixes for those customers.

84
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.959 
Now, Linux is Linux and

85
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.229 
the development model works the same across all the platforms.

86
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.209 
Now, what special of Linux on POWER?

87
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.779 
The philosophy that we try to follow is very simple.

88
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.889 
Linux is a great operating system, POWER is a great hardware platform.

89
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.649 
Linux on POWER is simply the combination of both.

90
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.389 
So we have as a common base the Linux ecosystem with open source

91
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.829 
and all the ISV application that are supported on it.

92
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.870 
We have the three major Linux distros and on top of that,

93
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.988 
Linux, when running on POWER supports the

94
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.559 
value add that the POWER infrastructure brings, and that includes capabilities

95
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.479 
of the processor, it includes capabilities of the POWER virtualisation

96
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.899 
and all the other hardware that's available on the platform.

97
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.749 
And this combination allows solutions for customers

98
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.249 
around a variety of applications, including big data, cloud

99
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.889 
and many other open-sourceapplications.

100
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.269 
This same model applies not only to the base Linux

101
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.829 
operating system where we work with Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu, but also

102
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.389 
goes up the stack. So just like Linux on POWER should

103
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.949 
look and feel the same as Linux on Intel does, the same holds true for

104
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.689 
virtualisation container solutions based on KVM and Docker cloud infrastructure, based

105
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.249 
on OpenStack, OpenShift, Cloud Foundry and all the other

106
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.259 
tools that are available these days.

107
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.969 
And again, we work with the open-sourcecommunity as IBMers

108
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.859 
to make sure that support for these IBM platforms is integrated and available

109
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.509 
as part of all these tools.

110
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.290 
As a result, looking at the most recent

111
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.865 
POWER9 family of IBM systems,

112
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:24.399 
there is a variety of machines available

113
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.629 
at a specialised for different application purposes, the one thing they all share in

114
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.849 
common is they all run Linux.

115
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.379 
Linux runs across the full IBM hardware platform and specifically the IBM

116
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.380 
POWER platform.

117
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.449 
More specifically, we have going from the right to the left,

118
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.350 
we have the Linux only machines on the right.

119
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.599 
On the very right and the far right is the AC922, which is

120
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.119 
a special model that supports use of GPUs

121
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.150 
as accelerators and therefore it's particularly suitable for

122
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.469 
AI type workloads, including machine learning and deep learning, who benefit in

123
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.739 
particular from the acceleration that these GPUs provide.

124
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.979 
The LC systems are similar, except they don't have the GPUs, but

125
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.809 
they are suited specifically to support big data workloads

126
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.719 
like Hadoop and the whole ecosystem around that.

127
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.350 
On the left hand side, we have sort of the traditional

128
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.299 
high-endenterprise POWER systems which are focussed

129
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.909 
around machine critical data-intensiveworkloads, and they come

130
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.589 
in various sizes. Now, these not only run Linux, but they also run

131
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.332 
the traditional IBM operating systems AIX and IBM i

132
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.349 
and they use the PowerVM virtualisation technology.

133
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.549 
On the right-handside, programs are not supported, but you can use the open-source

134
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.440 
KVM, Hypervisor to use virtualisation there as well.

135
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.169 
In addition to running.

136
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.449 
Linux on POWER on those permanent systems we also offer

137
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.189 
running Linux in the IBM cloud on

138
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.749 
POWER machines, and in particular, we make

139
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.309 
the IBM cloud private software stack available, which is again based

140
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.431 
on open source components, starting from OpenStack,

141
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.509 
Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry to allow customers who would like a cloud

142
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.609 
like solution, but who don't want to move their data outside of their own control,

143
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.289 
that those customers to build their own private cloud stack running, for example,

144
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.849 
on a large POWER9 machine using the standard

145
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.382 
open-source, cloud-basedsoftware optimised for POWER.

146
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.039 
Now, what are customers using all that for?

147
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.559 
As I said, Linux is Linux, POWER is POWER.

148
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.539 
The idea is that a Linux on POWER is suited in particular for workloads

149
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.979 
where Linux software is available and which also benefits in particular from

150
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.129 
the characteristics of the POWER platform.

151
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:16.079 
And that includes just as a number of representative samples, areas around

152
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.569 
the job applications and the infrastructure on that, but also analytics and research

153
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.759 
up to high-performancecomputing, supercomputing

154
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.529 
that is very flowing, quite intensive, but also business applications who focus

155
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.939 
on the high quality of service and the flexible infrastructure and resilience and

156
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.409 
security level that the platform provides. And finally, database workloads

157
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.699 
and there just is one example that has been very popular over the past few years is

158
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.459 
SAP HANA and SAP HANA currently is probably

159
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.009 
the workload that makes the most use

160
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.509 
of really large scale POWER installations, where

161
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.429 
today HANA supports up to 24 terabytes of in-memory databases

162
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.809 
running on a single POWER system.

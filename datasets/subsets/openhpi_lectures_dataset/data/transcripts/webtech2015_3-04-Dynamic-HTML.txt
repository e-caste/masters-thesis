00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.680 
Now let's have a closer look to Dynamic HTML.

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.870 
You know this. If you search through the World Wide Web, there are many documents

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.500 
with dynamic multimedia content.

4
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.590 
Multimedia content is

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.380 
when you browser is showing you a website,

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.230 
its browser also shows its multimedia content.

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.460 
The question is how this is organized.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:39.000 
This is organized by the way of so called Dynamic HTML -DHTML.

9
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.910 
And it's a possibility that HTML 4.0 provides so-called

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
client-side scripts and multimedia objects. And exactly this

11
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.860 
client-side script and the multimedia objects

12
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.590 
included in a document that

13
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.010 
are responsible for this

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.560 
dynamic web pages. So client-side script here are the most important components of the

15
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.990 
HTML.

16
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.750 
And the idea behind is that inside an HTML document characterized by the script tags.

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.150 
Scripts can be included in the HTML document.

18
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.490 
Then the scripts are transferred together with the HTML document to the

19
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.260 
client, to the browser. The browser starts to interpret this document

20
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.180 
and then the browser recognizes that their script and the scripts are executed.

21
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.530 
Inside of the client by the browser and then they can adapt the html documents

22
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.460 
to special user requirements.

23
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.510 
So the question how this HTML document and this executable

24
00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.980 
script are interacting. And this is described by means of the Document

25
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.890 
Object Model- DOM.

26
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.980 
Later on we have a closer look to it.

27
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.870 
As a script can be executed while loading the HTML document

28
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.410 
or they can also be executed when the user makes a specific event, for example

29
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.930 
mouse click or others.

30
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.040 
So the client server communication

31
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.700 
this is carried out via XMLHttpRequest.

32
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.780 
The format for this data transmission are for example XML, JSON and others.

33
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.170 
The Dynamic HTML allows to integrate all the multimedia objects.

34
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.420 
So the integration of any multimedia object in such an HTML document is possible

35
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.410 
within such object environments,

36
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.670 
and object environments here you see an example, so to represent

37
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.010 
these objects, the browser needs own programs or models so called browser plug-ins,

38
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.700 
and the multimedia object can be provided with attributes or parameters

39
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.940 
to configure execution, for example in which place or when the video is displayed

40
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.390 
so if you look to

41
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.750 
OpenHPI, then there are for example dynamic

42
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.720 
elements included. Multimedia object included here for example

43
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.890 
is the lecture video and then you can start to

44
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.920 
select some actions and to see this video.

45
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.260 
Your browser is able to display this video because the browser

46
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.300 
has plug-ins, has modules or programs,

47
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.230 
which makes, which brings them in the situation that it is able

48
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.360 
to understand the format, to understand the type of multimedia

49
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.040 
object and to display it.

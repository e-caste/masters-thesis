00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.480 
welcome back again and a hard welcome

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.150 
to the second part of our course i'm glad that you're still

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.020 
on board with us

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.850 
before we fulfill our promise and dig deeper into practice

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.330 
first we have to talk about a fundamental issue

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.780 
we face in the context of digitalisation and sustainability so

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.340 
please follow me on the following thought

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.570 
on almost a daily basis we see new versions of microprocessors aka chips

9
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.360 
in the news again someone announces that there is a new chip

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.410 
that is again more efficient than the old one

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's twice as fast as the older variant and does not need more

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.450 
energy at the same time

13
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.930 
there are tremendous technological advancements

14
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.380 
and that for quite a while now but

15
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.390 
have you ever asked yourself why we are still relatively slow

16
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
in reducing our co two footprint in the digital sector

17
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.050 
there's there are many improvements in efficiency for decades now

18
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.970 
but overall the c or two footprint in the digital sector is

19
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870 
not decreasing as fast as it should be

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.670 
even if digitalisation is increasing these tremendous efficiency

21
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.320 
advancements are so high that they still should reduce the

22
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
overall c or two footprint of

23
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.710 
in fact somehow it does not

24
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.990 
so what is the problem behind that

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.870 
can we explain that there must be some effects let's call them barriers

26
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.210 
to sustainable digitalisation that hinder the co two in the sector

27
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.840 
to decrease faster

28
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.410 
let's discuss that using the example of data centres

29
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.690 
remember we've discussed that data centres are the place where

30
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.550 
most of the software runs today and therefore a very important

31
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.140 
part of the overall picture

32
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.980 
so what do operators of data centres follow to reduce their co two footprint

33
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.760 
well we've already seen some examples earlier like efficient

34
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.190 
bin packing or keeping data as local as possible hasche take storage hierarchy

35
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.640 
in addition for instance their share of renewable energy

36
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.010 
use the power supply can be increased that clearly reduces co two emissions

37
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.660 
or another example you build larger data centres because the

38
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.180 
overall efficiency of a large data centre is higher compared

39
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.560 
to the same computing power

40
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.590 
distributed or distributed among several smaller data centres

41
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.760 
simply thanks to scaling effects of course this only holds if you have

42
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.190 
enough customers to so that the rate of utilisation of the

43
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.990 
resources in the data centre is high

44
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.560 
also you can rely on the efficiency improvements of the hardware

45
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.990 
as someone who is operating a data centre

46
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.640 
since the computing power of the hardware is ever increasing

47
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.030 
while the energy consumption stays often constant this helps

48
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.630 
to reduce co two emissions as well simply because you need

49
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.120 
less cpu's to run the same amount of software

50
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.790 
if you replace the old sim pews with the more efficient ones

51
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.090 
but and this is exactly the problem in practice these efficiency advancements are often

52
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.110 
compensated and that's so much that

53
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.860 
increase the efficiency basically it does not lead to an overall lower

54
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.840 
co two footprint they are obvious barriers here

55
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.380 
and we have a deeper look at them

56
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.350 
there are two interesting laws or rather empirical observations

57
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.010 
that show trends for several decades now

58
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.610 
and did not change fundamentally until today

59
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.630 
the first one you probably know moore's law moore's law states that

60
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.410 
the number of transistors in integrated circuits such as cpu's

61
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.670 
doubles every two years

62
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.680 
this does not mean that the performance is increasing linearly

63
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.560 
by the factor two as well but it increases significantly

64
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.710 
in the diagram on the right here you see this trend describing

65
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.120 
by the straight line and it described by the straight line with a

66
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.550 
positive slope so the more you follow towards the end of the

67
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.080 
straight line on the top-right the more transistors the cpu's have

68
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.190 
and the mathematical equation of the slope is roughly

69
00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.430 
y equals to x so every two years on the x axis the time line

70
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.130 
the number of transistors doubles

71
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.570 
then there is another empirical law the so called cooney's law

72
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.240 
stating that in roughly the same time as in morse law

73
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.610 
one half year instead of two years the power consumption for

74
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.010 
each computing unit is cut in half

75
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.920 
in our diagram this is described by the straight line with the negative slope

76
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.740 
at the bottom right there are you find the more efficient cpu's

77
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.590 
now if you combine the two los or the two straight lines that means

78
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.050 
we see the amount of transistors or computing units

79
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.790 
doubling and roughly in the same time period the energy consumption per computing unit

80
00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.580 
is cut in half

81
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.670 
then logic follows that the overall energy consumption is

82
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.240 
constant while the computing performance is increasing

83
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.090 
and this is grey right i mean we have more computing power

84
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.260 
while the resources we need for that

85
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.810 
the energy consumption for computing

86
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.350 
stays the same

87
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.260 
well we are human beings and when human beings

88
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.180 
can get more for the same price then we often want more

89
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.090 
which then increases the resource consumption again when we want more

90
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.260 
this is a big trap and this is one of the major barriers of sustainable

91
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.360 
behavior it also has a name

92
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.190 
the tension rises what is it

93
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.520 
is the rebound effect

94
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.930 
it is well known and also well applied from many of us unfortunately

95
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.220 
more than we would actually think

96
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.010 
in the software context there is

97
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.390 
an even empirical empirical law the earth law that describes the rebound effect

98
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.870 
in the context of software it says

99
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.640 
software is getting slower more rapidly

100
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.410 
than hardware is becoming faster exactly that

101
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:32.190 
so when the efficiency advancements in hardware are compensated of us

102
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.890 
creating software that is overall slower we don't gain too much right

103
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.290 
so there's of course some limits to this logic

104
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.890 
it simplifies a few things but the general message is robust which is that

105
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.330 
our efficiency advancements are good but not good enough

106
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.400 
because they do not reduce the resource consumption overall

107
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.570 
at the end of the day

108
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.650 
and for our planet the overall co two emissions are what count

109
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:05.630 
so

110
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.140 
obviously we need other strategies in addition to the efficiency strategy

111
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.850 
in order to reduce resource consumption or co two emissions

112
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.960 
or in other words to do digitalisation and software engineering more sustainably

113
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.840 
in the next we do we have to talk about other strategies

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.980 
greetings everyone. my name is
Justin Reich. I'm a professor at

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.530 
the massachusetts institute of
technology and the author

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.010 
of a recent book failure to disrupt why
technology alone can't transform education.

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.770 
there are two questions that I got
really excited about talking

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.690 
with you all about in this openHPI
form. how can we avoid a

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.730 
situation where online offers
may only benefits to educated

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.180 
citizens who are passionate about
learning and actively engage in it.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.530 
and how can digital education be
made interesting and fruitful

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.150 
for people with lower self-motivation. those
are really important questions to tackle.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.010 
in my new book i have a chapter
called the EdTech Matthew

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.620 
effect which goes through a
substantial body of research that

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.850 
suggests that new technologies
disproportionately benefit the affluent.

13
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
they're often described as having
a potential democratizing

14
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.930 
effect that they can close the gaps between
more and less affluent students.

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.780 
but we often find in practice that new
technologies even free technologies

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.870 
are most useful to people with
the financial and technical

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.730 
and social capital to take
advantage of new innovations.

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.190 
so my first order answer to these
questions is one that may

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.290 
be education technologists or
instructional designers won't

20
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.880 
necessarily like that much. how
do we avoid a situation where

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.290 
online offers only benefit to educated
citizens who are passionate

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
about learning and actively engaged?
how do we make education

23
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
interesting and fruitful for people
with lower self-motivation?

24
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.650 
the most important answers are going to
be politics and social movements.

25
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.570 
we are not going to design new
technologies that solve the

26
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.790 
problem of educational inequality.
the hard parts of educational

27
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.960 
systems are still going to be hard. no matter
what kinds of technologies we develop.

28
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.960 
there are some things that
technologies can do. but they're

29
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.080 
going to be small in proportion to
the to the part of the problem

30
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.970 
that needs to be solved
through politics.

31
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.340 
how do we make it so that new
technologies or, how do we address

32
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.550 
the fact that new technologies often
benefit educated citizens in particular?

33
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.360 
while one way we could address
them that is we could try to

34
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.050 
make more educated citizens. we
could put more resources more

35
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.410 
effort behind primary and secondary
schooling. so that as people

36
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.830 
reach adulthood they have the
apprenticeship in a formal education

37
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.070 
system that allows them to be successful
in informal online learning.

38
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.660 
another way to think about the
question is to say that everyone

39
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.690 
is passionate about learning and
throughout the networked world

40
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.110 
young and old rich and poor. there
are all kinds of folks who

41
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.350 
are actively engaged in learning.
but the kinds of learning

42
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.670 
of there actively engaged in
isn't always recognizeda as my

43
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.350 
colleagues who worked on the project called
connected learning has discussed.

44
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.620 
there are hundreds of thousands
maybe millions of young people

45
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.090 
who are writing online in fanfiction
communities? there are

46
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.790 
people who are making memes and
creating videos. they're learning

47
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.130 
computer programming. but they're
learning computer programming

48
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.940 
to make scratch animations or minecraft
videos or video game levels.

49
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.610 
all of these interests have the
potential to be connected to

50
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.770 
labour market opportunities to
opportunities in the civispheore.

51
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.300 
but many of these activities still find
themselves in the periphery of the curriculum.

52
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.460 
it's a little bit hard to build technology
platforms that help young people

53
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.390 
find these interests engage in these
interests develop these skills.

54
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.910 
the really hard work is changing
curricula in our educational

55
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.290 
institutions going to our educational
agencies and saying these

56
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.480 
curriculum we have now are over
stuffed. and we need to remove

57
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.380 
some of these things to make more
room for the things at the

58
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.240 
periphery of the curriculum that
young people are really excited

59
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.590 
about. and move those things more
into the core. that's the really

60
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.510 
really hard work to do to unlock
these kinds of interest driven

61
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.890 
learning opportunities. it is a
little bit building new tech.

62
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.280 
it's mostly building new curriculum and
building new education policies.

63
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.730 
how can digital education be
made interesting and fruitful

64
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.300 
for people with lower self-motivation? with
my colleague Joshua Lindberg Tobias.

65
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.200 
we did a study of one of the first
mooc based blended professional

66
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.770 
degree programs. and one of the
things we found as the questions

67
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.450 
suggested that master students
were more likely to successfully

68
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.750 
complete online courses. but we
also found that men were and

69
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.840 
when we talked to men about how they
found the time to do their coursework.

70
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.990 
they said well they snuck it in
during lunch. and they stayed

71
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.780 
late at the office at night. and
they snuck away on the weekends

72
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.650 
to be able to work on things. and
in some ways that reflects

73
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.900 
high levels of motivation, really
strong self-regulated learning.

74
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.590 
in other respects it reflects
shirking family responsibilities.

75
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.240 
one potential cause for the
differences that we saw in males

76
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.950 
progress versus female progress
in these courses is that men

77
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.730 
are culturally more tolerated when they
shirk their family responsibilities,

78
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.310 
and women are not. the flip side
of self-regulated learning

79
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.140 
can be things like shirking family
responsibilities. so I might

80
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.840 
modify this question a little
bit, how can digital education

81
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.900 
be made interesting and fruitful for
people with lower self-motivation?

82
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.420 
but we said with lower self-regulated
learning. but actually instead of lower

83
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.040 
what if we said worse conditions
for self-regulated learning?

84
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.230 
what if we recognize that it's
easier to be motivated to do

85
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.330 
this kind of self regulated learning
? if you have the cultural

86
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.430 
conditions to support that, if you
are needed to conduct childcare.

87
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.180 
there's nothing that we're going to
build inside learning environments

88
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.920 
that makes them so compelling or so
useful that you can ignore childcare.

89
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.880 
the way to make more opportunities
for people of the conditions

90
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.090 
for better self-regulated learning
for women in particular

91
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.450 
is to do things like have better
arrangements for childcare

92
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.780 
for people who are pursuing learning
opportunities, and of course

93
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.210 
not just childcare but all kinds
of familial responsibilities.

94
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.940 
so again there are probably some
things that we can do in courses

95
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.410 
to make them more engaging to
provide more advising to create

96
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.050 
human connections and
things like that.

97
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.780 
but part of the answer to these
questions is not just thinking

98
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.220 
about what's inside our technologies,
but thinking about all

99
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.820 
the different kinds of conditions and
contexts outside of our technologies.

100
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.440 
so again these are ideas that
i talk about more in failure

101
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.830 
to disrupt this chapter about the
ed-tech Matthew effect. I'm

102
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.500 
really glad that folks are wrestling
with these questions and

103
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.210 
I look forward to learning more
about your discussions and

104
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.070 
what you come up with.

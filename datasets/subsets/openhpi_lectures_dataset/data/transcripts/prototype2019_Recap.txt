Hi everyone! Thanks for being
with us in this course.

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.180 
We want to take the chance to
connect this MOOC to the two

3
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.090 
other courses that we designed
and ran on this platform.

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.630 
As you may remember we presented
the design thinking process in

5
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.050 
three phases: The first phase is
about looking outside instead

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.510 
of relying on your own
ideas and assumptions.

7
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.670 
The second phase is all about
creating ideas based on the user

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.060 
needs and inspirations we discovered.
- And the third phase is

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.610 
about prototyping ideas and
testing them with people we wish

10
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.140 
to design for. Of course this is
not a linear process, it's an

11
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.120 
iterative one. Our hope is that
you'd take what you learn in this

12
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.040 
course and apply it to a real user
problem in your own context.

13
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.570 
In a real life project, you might
need to go back and forth

14
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.940 
between different phases, or go
through several iteration loops

15
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.760 
to get to that
user-centered solution.

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.510 
We want to thank you for being
part of this journey with us

17
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.360 
and we hope that you
learned something new.

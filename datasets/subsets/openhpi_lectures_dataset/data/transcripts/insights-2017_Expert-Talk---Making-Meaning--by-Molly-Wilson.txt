Hi! I'm Molly Wilson.

2
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:11.740 
I’m a UX designer and a design educator,

3
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:14.370 
and I'm here to talk with you about making meaning.

4
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.600 
So when you do design research,

5
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.370 
you find a lot of information,

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:22.220 
but you need to know what that information means.

7
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.770 
You need to know what to do with it.

8
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:27.930 
So you need to go from information to interpretation.

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:30.340 
How do you do this? By making connections.

10
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.830 
You connect the information that you have

11
00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:35.970 
by putting it in context

12
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:37.640 
with other pieces of information.

13
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.430 
You want to consider the entire world

14
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:44.740 
that this information lives in. This sounds really abstract.

15
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:48.270 
So let's think through it by thinking about an actual example.

16
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.640 
What if you are doing research and asking people

17
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:54.000 
about how they track their daily spending.

18
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:56.080 
You talk to one person,

19
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:58.200 
and she says that managing

20
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:01.980 
money is annoying. Yeah, alright. On its own,

21
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:04.520 
this quote actually doesn't mean that much.

22
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.180 
But once you start to find out more information

23
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.110 
about this person,

24
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:12.240 
you'll start to see how you might interpret this quote.

25
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:14.450 
So I'm gonna tell you a little more about her.

26
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.410 
What if she is the singer in a rock band

27
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:19.200 
and her band tours a lot?

28
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:20.720 
Her band has seven people in it.

29
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.370 
She writes most of the songs.

30
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:24.510 
She is the main creative force behind the band,

31
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.450 
and she thinks that managing money is annoying.

32
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:30.080 
Now, we can interpret this quote.

33
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:32.960 
We can make some educated guesses about its hidden meaning.

34
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.530 
She's a singer:

35
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:36.790 
she probably didn't think she was going to have

36
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:38.960 
to do this kind of money management

37
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:40.920 
when she decided to be a singer

38
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.350 
or when she founded the band.

39
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:44.000 
She had to learn somehow.

40
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:47.120 
That learning process may not have been easy or expected.

41
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:49.880 
She tours with seven people.

42
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:51.030 
This is a big group.

43
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.210 
This is complicated,

44
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:57.160 
it’s probably complicated logistically and also complicated socially.

45
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.100 
It's not just about her and her money.

46
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.560 
She writes the songs herself,

47
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.490 
so she is the creative force.

48
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:05.980 
She probably feels

49
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:08.220 
a tension between the creative side

50
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:10.340 
and the analytical side of her work.

51
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.900 
Maybe it kills her creative buzz

52
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:17.180 
sometimes. You could explore these hidden meanings even more,

53
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:20.180 
and see if patterns start to emerge

54
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:21.480 
when you talk to more

55
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:26.210 
people, do more research and validate some of these interpretations.

56
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.920 
When you start to see patterns in the hidden meanings

57
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:30.740 
that you're finding:

58
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.780 
that is when you know that

59
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:35.300 
you found something really deep and interesting.

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.970 
In our openHPI course "blockchain revealing the myth", now we consider

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.983 
projects and application areas for block chain solutions.

3
00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:12.930 
Blockchain ofcourse over the last years this was

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.429 
a very hyped battement.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.620 
Many applications in many fields claim to have new

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.530 
innovative blockchain solutions.

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.230 
Some of them only are shared solutions

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.420 
to increase the price in the market has really opened the door

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.609 
to new application and new solution approaches.

10
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.900 
So we and our course have retraced the way of blockchain solutions

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.549 
from a cryptocurrency or decentralized registry

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.225 
like the Bitcoin system to a programable, decentralized trust

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.239 
infrastructure. But the use cases like decentralized

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.010 
registry and infrastructures still sounds like buzzwords,

15
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.930 
and we should look in more detail what

16
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.170 
lies behind them.

17
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.010 
So what we want to do is to fill in the password with examples

18
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.419 
of already existing blockchain based solutions.

19
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.625 
And indeed, there are attempts to introduce blockchains in almost

20
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.960 
every type of application area with which is based

21
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.109 
and which is using a decentralized infrastructure.

22
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.191 
So we see applications in science, in medicine, in identity

23
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.599 
management, in cloud computing, cloud storage, in the Internet of Things and finance,

24
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.479 
insurance, logistics, retail and energy supply these and

25
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.509 
many other sectors are the beneficiaries of block chain,

26
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.599 
And we will consider in the next clips some of the applications.

27
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.620 
So there are numerous start ups we have found that set off our block chain

28
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.369 
as a total solution or as a part of solutions.

29
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.099 
In the world there are five global blockchain startup

30
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.134 
hubs, so most important is a start up for blockchain

31
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.310 
in Silicon Valley. Then there is another one here in London.

32
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.279 
There are almost as much startups

33
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.770 
like in Silicon Valley.

34
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.569 
New York is an important place, which a lot of

35
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.740 
startup is a great blockchain solutions.

36
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.810 
Singapore and the fifth is Los Angeles.

37
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.450 
So it's really a worldwide hub and a worldwide

38
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.019 
try to find solutions.

39
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.630 
This was about startups, but here you see also companies with established

40
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.439 
products and services, iBM, Microsoft and many more they ar

41
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.289 
following the hype and they work and develop and use

42
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.669 
blockchain solutions.

43
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.029 
So here, you can see the world wide spread of companies which deal

44
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.449 
with the block chain technology, the biggest is in the United

45
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.099 
States. Then there are others, particularly in China.

46
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.949 
We see a lot of activity in the UK, in Singapore,

47
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.360 
in South Korea. So it is really a world wide

48
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.930 
spread of technology and there are many block chain projects.

49
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.410 
And the question is, are they successful?

50
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.590 
And do they really provide new solutions

51
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.599 
with new applications?

52
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.789 
And of course, not all blockchain projects are successful.

53
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.839 
That's clear.

54
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.800 
And also not all startups and

55
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.650 
vendor projects are successful.

56
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.619 
So the hype around the blockchain technology is, of course, a driver

57
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.419 
of the development. And at the same time, it is also the reason

58
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.249 
for many failures because people try to jump

59
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.420 
on this hype and to come out with a solution that's not

60
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.350 
well-developed or not ready.

61
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.850 
Blockchain is not fully understood by the

62
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.720 
people that try to develop blockchain solution or apply

63
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.310 
them. It's not fully understood, nor there's enough time for

64
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.089 
serious planning and development to benefit from the hype

65
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.339 
and from the technology.

66
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.629 
So most important is to understand the block chain technology before starting

67
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.009 
a project in order to make use of its strengths.

68
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.399 
There are widespread use cases for block

69
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.869 
chain projects, so they are the block chain solutions

70
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.819 
which try to track possession of a value, for example,

71
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.149 
in buying and selling paintings at auctions.

72
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.759 
This is easy to prove as a history of ownership

73
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.649 
of a painting by collecting all the documents around this,

74
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.379 
it remains the question of how to connect the physical object,

75
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.980 
the painting with its digital identity.

76
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.509 
But this is not what we want to discuss here.

77
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.619 
But this is an example for blockchain technology

78
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.149 
successfully applied for tracking the possession of a value.

79
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.879 
Blockchain projects are successfully applied

80
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.649 
in the field of voting, so blockchain based platform for

81
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.569 
censorship resistant votings, so the system can protect

82
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.216 
the votes by ensuring that they will not be altered by

83
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.120 
any third party.

84
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.699 
This could be realized with UTXO, or the account

85
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.139 
based solutions.

86
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.089 
The automatic contracts have a lot of applications,

87
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.620 
for example, in booking or renting cars, bicycles,

88
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.180 
holiday houses, private accommodation.

89
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.050 
So this can be done with quite simple smart contracts.

90
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.500 
A lot of blockchain projects are successfully

91
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.500 
applied in the field of identity and reputation systems.

92
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.749 
More and more health data is being generated, for example,

93
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.550 
through wearable devices.

94
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.903 
And this data need to be stored and managed in a secure way.

95
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.851 
For such data o nly limited access should be granted,

96
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.125 
particular to specific data, like a smartphone, a smart

97
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.160 
profile that can give patients ability

98
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.959 
to decide for themselves about who, with whom and or whether to share

99
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.723 
their own data. So this is possibly the best of

100
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.529 
using a account based solutions.

101
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.839 
Decentralized markets is a large field of blockchain

102
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.610 
projects and successfully block chain applications.

103
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.709 
Blockchain based peer to peer online trading , users can act as

104
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.629 
by us all sellers and pay and purchase goods in various crypto currencies.

105
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:51.149 
When the buyer and seller agree on the product unsurprised,

106
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.139 
then the buyer sends a money to the smart contract address

107
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.982 
the buyer. If buyer and seller is satisfied with the idea, the buyer

108
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.890 
releases the money to the seller and then the seller gets its money.

109
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.520 
In case of any problems, for example, good was not delivered

110
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.279 
in the right form or does not meet the quality requirements.

111
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.520 
A moderator can intervene in the communication.

112
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.489 
Here are two of three multi- signature smart contracts

113
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.109 
could be used as a solution.

114
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.622 
Block chain have a lot of application in the field of decentralized autonomous

115
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:35.249 
organization. This organization has a decentralized structure

116
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.989 
without or made a decision making according to defined

117
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.549 
rules. So in this way a lot of things

118
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.900 
could be regulated.

119
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.625 
So the rules are prettified. Rules are determined by the majority

120
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.450 
decisions of the involved participants.

121
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.006 
So this decentralized autonomous organizations buy products, buy

122
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.339 
services in compliance with their smart contracts, payment

123
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.035 
is made in a cryptocurrency so decentralized autonomous

124
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.749 
organizations are based on the specifications the

125
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.749 
contractors produce their products and services, which are in

126
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.610 
turn are used or marketed by the

127
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.179 
decentralized autonomous organization.

128
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.219 
So the marketing of these products and services, the decentralized

129
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.870 
automated organization earns money that is reinvested

130
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.799 
or can be divided among the shareholders.

131
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.359 
Here, account-based solutions are doing so.

132
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.220 
In summary, there are many, many areas of applications

133
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.289 
for block chain technology, and every time it's important to understand

134
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.204 
that technology is the right way to see whether really blockchain

135
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:05.040 
is needed and is helpful for a solution and application

136
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.986 
in that area. And so to understand who takes advantage

137
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.679 
of the blockchain system and its strengths,

138
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.996 
this can be the key to success and thus helps to prevent objects

139
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.674 
from failing. We see a lot of objects and we see a lot of projects

140
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.320 
failing in this field. And often the reason is simply

141
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.330 
that the technology is not fully understandable or is not the right match

142
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.325 
between the technology variants and the solution of the

143
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.810 
things. The block chain technology is not only

144
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.029 
a topic for companies, it is also a topic

145
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.350 
at the national level of individual countries.

146
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.797 
So there are a lot of applications that can

147
00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:01.080 
be done. So a detailed overview of a block chain projects,

148
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.669 
for example, in Europe is provided by the European Union

149
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.609 
Block Chain Observatory and Forum.

150
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.230 
You can find it here.

151
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.684 
We decided not to mention start ups, companies

152
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.029 
and concrete projects, you can find in the Internet.

153
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.659 
Reason is that it's not really clear.

154
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.889 
On the one side, we do not advertise some of the solution and also sites,

155
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.589 
it's not clear whether they are on the long end are real use

156
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.359 
useful and successful companies you can find and perhaps this

157
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.496 
European overview is helpful to see, that in all these mentioned

158
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.623 
areas, a lot of players are offering blockchain solutions

159
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.159 
and partnership.

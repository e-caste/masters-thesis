00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.910 
i'll get started. hello, my name is jonna Lee, i'm a research scientist

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.240 
at georgia tech i'm pleased to present with my co-author john

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.030 
hosmer also from georgia tech on our research project titled

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.390 
how online learners build kong its presence implications from

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.760 
a machine learning approach.

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.840 
first please let me give you a brief introduction about our project.

7
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.770 
online discussion forums which our study focuses on serve as

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.130 
an important venue for learning by looking at discussion forum

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.020 
data we can learn how old-line students build knowledge with others.

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.140 
in this study we focus on understanding how old-line students

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.840 
develop higher order or critical thinking through the lands

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.010 
of community of inquiry framework. specifically we apply the

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.810 
concept of cognitive presence also we use machine learning

14
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.580 
algorithms to build and test a model that can predict the phase

15
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580 
of cognitive presence of a learners discussion posts.

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.140 
just to quickly explain cognitive presence researchers have

17
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.940 
proposed that a learner's cognitive presence can be manifested

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.500 
through four developing phases. these phases include triggering events

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
exploration of ideas integration of ideas and resolution of

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.040 
the problem or issue.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.060 
so our project was guided by the following research questions on the screen.

22
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.790 
we believe that answering these questions can provide useful implications

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.930 
for the potential value of cognitive presence prediction in labeling,

24
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.910 
for example this information can be used to provide informative

25
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.220 
feedback to instructors about online students' learning and progress.

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.800 
now please let me hand it off to john. thank you.

27
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.280 
so for our modeling part we first started off by collecting data.

28
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.780 
we collected data from a pair of different forums which georgia

29
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.060 
tech hosts online classes using.

30
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.020 
the data that was collected were from computer science classes

31
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.170 
both at the undergraduate and graduate level.

32
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.970 
we then remove specific topics that we did not believe would

33
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.420 
have any students working on problems specifically announcement

34
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
and introduction posts were excluded from our test.

35
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.540 
then to model the data we split into training validation and test sets,

36
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.710 
for more challenging tests we would elect to train and validate

37
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.110 
on one data set specifically one of the forums and then test

38
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.360 
on the other forum. this test was created because we are interested

39
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.680 
to see how well our model will perform when exposed to new

40
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.130 
fora that were not exposed during training.

41
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.640 
the initial model that we used is a model called the word movers distance.

42
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.900 
this model is very similar to a k-means model, which uses word

43
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.720 
embeddings to try to get the difference between a new post and a

44
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.940 
new post that have been seen before.

45
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.810 
this model was not very successful in predicting the

46
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.530 
cognitive presence of a specific post.

47
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.090 
however after this, we used an attention based model specifically

48
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.130 
a model called bert which is pre trained on a specific set of tasks.

49
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.630 
and found that we were able to achieve near human level accuracy

50
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.370 
when we're exposed to all the data that was available for training

51
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.100 
and validation and then a small subset for our test.

52
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.510 
the only caveat here is that we found that our model was not

53
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.790 
able to generalized across the new test set.

54
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.910 
we are somewhat unsure if it would not generalize to further new data,

55
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.660 
because we saw when only exposed to a specific forum the model

56
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.190 
is not able to even over fit to its own training set.

57
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.180 
overall we think that our model is accurate to new posts within

58
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.060 
the same domain and from a forum we have seen before.

59
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.850 
however it is clear that our model is highly sensitive to the

60
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.510 
data that is available to it, and we expect that different data

61
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.640 
and data from different areas would improve the model greatly.

62
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.570 
we also hope to put this model in the hands of instructors

63
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.370 
to ensure that the data being given to them is actually useful. thank you.

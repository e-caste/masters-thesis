00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.480 
Hi my name is Thomas. My name is Matthias and we will introduce

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.530 
you to a new feature today of the OpenHPI platform and this is

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.070 
the peer assessment. And

4
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.110 
so what is peer assessment?

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.860 
Well actually peer assessment is a new feature that we developed, a new tool

6
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.560 
for the platform and this will allow you to assess your fellow students, fellow

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.810 
participants of the course and it will allow them to assess

8
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.500 
your work. So

9
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.320 


10
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.910 
it consists of two steps

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.400 
and these two steps are:

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.330 
first, you work on the task and submit a solution. So you will

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.030 
get a task from us and you work on that, submit a solution.

14
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.660 
And then in the second step, you will evaluate the submissions

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.120 
of some of your peers, not all of them that would be a bit too much,

16
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.330 
but some of them.

17
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.730 
And only if you had both parts you would receive any points.

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.750 
So just submitting your work isn't sufficient. You really have to

19
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.320 
grade the work of your peers.

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.310 
I think it's just fair because otherwise no one would like to

21
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.390 
gradew= the others. Then you don't get any grades from your peers, so.

22
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.490 
Yeah exactly. And we do this for two reasons. As I said you don't have to grade

23
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.630 
all of your peers.

24
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.880 
That's the first reason why we're doing this. We can't do that either. So

25
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
you had to provide more complex tasks or tasks

26
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.900 
that are not as easily accessible as on

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.380 
multiple-choice quizzes, for example

28
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.580 
would pose problems to us as we can't solve because we can create

29
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.790 
ten thousands of submissions manually.

30
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.840 
But if we share the task and everybody does a little bit

31
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.770 
of their work, then it's scalable again and then we can do that.

32
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.300 
And the second reason is even more important and that is

33
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.720 
because we want you to see not only your solution but also the solutions

34
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.290 
of other students, of other participants in the course and

35
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.850 
so that you can learn not only from doing

36
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.930 
that or from solving these tasks, but also from seeing

37
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.680 
and evaluating how others have solved the same task. And it's

38
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.860 
a great form of reflecting the task again and maybe you see a very

39
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.810 
interesting and other solution to the task that you haven't thought about but

40
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.980 
one of the peers you grade found and so this might also be

41
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.470 
giving you more insights into the topic.

42
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.930 
Yeah it's just a win win situation.

43
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.280 
So

44
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.640 
let's go a little bit into the details on how

45
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.610 
these phases work. So what you have to do so we start with the submission phase

46
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.010 
and the submission phase means

47
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.930 
you work on the task that we give you and then you submit your solution.

48
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.330 
Really easy. Right after that the peer assessment phase

49
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.380 
comes into play and this

50
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.700 
means that you have to evaluate the work of three of your peers.

51
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.290 
These will be selected automatically

52
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
by the system for you, so you will get kind of one

53
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.370 
submission after the next one and you just like,

54
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.140 
you get a couple of

55
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.390 
rubrics that we suggest

56
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.010 
which are kind of the basis of the evaluation and you can give points

57
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.610 
for these rubrics. And but not only the points are the important thing

58
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.820 
what we think is that it's important that you write something

59
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.650 
to your fellow students and that you kind of give them some

60
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.070 
hynes what they could do. Better or what you especially liked

61
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.150 
about their work or stuff like that. Just imagine you are the learner

62
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.350 
and you want not only to have a comment like

63
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.040 
'does not work' or 'well done', you would like something more constructive that

64
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.280 
gives you an idea ok 'I could have done this better'

65
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.840 
by solving it like this or like that, so yeah please always try to give

66
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.300 
very good advice to your peers

67
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.060 
that might help them even more exactly. So

68
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.700 
don't be too pernickety. So

69
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.260 
if you don't like something about the code of your peers or

70
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.450 
the work of your peers,

71
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.860 
rather write them a useful review, then substracting them points.

72
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.260 
That doesn't mean you should or you should always give full

73
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.560 
points for everything but

74
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.880 
if in doubt write or write a good

75
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.290 
review. And we are not at the academy for code beauty, so

76
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.140 
if the code works, you might probably still know a more elegant

77
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.340 
way of solving the problem, but if it's solved then it's ok and

78
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.820 
just give the points. It's not about the beauty of coding here.

79
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.140 
Yeah we're all just right in the beginning. We only scratch the surface of

80
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.930 
coding in this course. So umm, just to get a feeling

81
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.690 
of things work and yeah what I just said rather write a helpful comment

82
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.270 
than withdrawing too many points.

83
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.050 
And the next phase after that peer reviews, the self assessment.

84
00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:01.100 
So that means you've seen all the code or the work of your of your peers,

85
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.120 
and now think about what you have submitted-

86
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.560 
is it better or is it worse, that you put a lot of effort in it and

87
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.040 
you think that worth the effort or.

88
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.360 
So try to give yourself

89
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.650 
some points. How much points do you think is your

90
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.350 
submission worth in comparison to the stuff that you saw from your peers?

91
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.670 
But Tom, if I'm allowed to assess myself,

92
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.890 
wouldn't I give myself the full points? I mean isn't that better?

93
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.260 
Sounds like a reasonable idea, but actually it isn't because

94
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.790 
you don't get the points that you give yourself

95
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.140 
but what you will get is

96
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.850 
a couple of bonus points if your self assessment is pretty close

97
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.360 
to the assessment that you received from your peers. So if your peers

98
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.850 
in total gave you let's say ten points and your self assessment

99
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.330 
is also ten points, then you will get some bonus points.

100
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.060 
Eleven or nine points probably. You also will get some bonus points

101
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.650 
but the further you're away from the

102
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.870 
assessment of your peers,

103
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.660 
the less bonus points you get. So it doesn't help

104
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.610 
to give yourself the best grade that's available but

105
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.460 
try to be realistic.

106
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.240 
So in the final phase of the peer assessment, we have a review phase.

107
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.220 
So a review means that you can

108
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.020 
give your peers that graded you, or that assessed you, you can give them

109
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.820 
a review. A review means you don't have to write anything here

110
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.410 
it's just a kind of was the assessment of the review of

111
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.150 
your peers, was that helpful for you so you can in this phase give them

112
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.190 
from 0 to 4. From zero to three stars,

113
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.990 
and which will

114
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.040 
also reflect in the grade in the end. So if you receive

115
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.850 
a lot of stars from your peers that means if you have written good

116
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:31.390 
assessments and helpful assessments not depending on the points you give.

117
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.740 
Not exactly. As on the comments and the the advice you give

118
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.990 
while grading others. Exactly. Then

119
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.390 
you will get some additional bonus points here as well.

120
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.820 
Yeah and by the way all of this peer assessment is done anonymously.

121
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.580 
So you don't have to feel shy that you might be embarrassed

122
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.670 
by your own solution or

123
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.830 
feel unprotected that others know your name cause that won't. Everything is done

124
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.410 
anonymously in both directions. So you don't know who grades and

125
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.060 
those that you graded don't know who graded them.

126
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.010 
Of course that means

127
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.090 
don't write your name

128
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.510 
in the submission because then

129
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.220 
the anonymity is gone obviously.

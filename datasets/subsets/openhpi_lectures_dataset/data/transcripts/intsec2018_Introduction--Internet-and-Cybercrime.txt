00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.780 
Welcome to our openHPI course
about Internet Security.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.090 
Welcome to the first
week of this course.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.380 
In this week we want to speak
about internet and cybercrime.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.070 
The internet, if you look in the
construction, it is a network of

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
networks. It's a net of nets. So,
it's not a physical network,

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.160 
it is a virtual network,
a virtual network

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.310 
that is provided by means of
the internet communication

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.820 
protocols, the TCP/IP protocol
stack which provides for the user

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.250 
the impression that all the
linked networks, local networks

10
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.150 
form together a homogeneous
network - the internet.

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.850 
The wide distribution of
the internet is because

12
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.380 
of its open system architecture -
everyone sees how it works,

13
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.320 
everyone can connect his own
network to the internet.

14
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.000 
The internet is not
so old. In 1969

15
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.990 
it starts with four computers.
Four computers at universities

16
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.040 
in the west of U.S and then
there was over the years

17
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.680 
an explosive growth in
the last five decades.

18
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.390 
Today, starting '69 it was
four computers. Today there

19
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.320 
are around three
billion internet users worldwide,

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.660 
there is one billion, more than
one billion internet hosts

21
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.060 
computers, smartphones,
industrial equipment

22
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.650 
devices that are connected to
the internet that can use the

23
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.620 
internet for their
communication purpose

24
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.840 
and there is really only a
rough estimation, more than 20

25
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.180 
billion web pages.

26
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.690 
When we speak about
internet and when we see

27
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.630 
that internet is used as a
global marketplace that

28
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.520 
one can do online banking,
one can do e-shopping,

29
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.200 
e-government activities, also our
learning offers from openHPI

30
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.480 
come over the internet,
then the question is

31
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.900 
how this runs in a secure way.
So we speak of IT security

32
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.150 
and when we speak of
IT security, we mean

33
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.390 
to protect this information
processing systems

34
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.970 
against the wide variety of
different threats and attacks.

35
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.830 
There are attacks on computers -
so called cyberattacks,

36
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.030 
the number of attackers
is increasing, the number

37
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.560 
of attacks is increasing. Ihe more
attractive the internet is, the

38
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.510 
more cybercrime comes
and tries to get access

39
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.100 
to data, tries to disturb
services or do other things.

40
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.210 
Today many of the attacks
are highly automated,

41
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
run in a very sophisticated
way and in an automated way.

42
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.130 
So there is also really
a rough estimation

43
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.550 
that there are more than
four million attacks

44
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.010 
per day that are performed
via the internet,

45
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.420 
performed against hosts that are
connected to the internet,

46
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.940 
against servers that
provide services.

47
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.610 
It's almost
impossible

48
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.720 
to evaluate the damage
of all these attacks.

49
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.790 
So the potential damage
of these attacks is

50
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.310 
increasing with ever increasing
digitization of our

51
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.100 
work, of our leisure, of our
commerce industry and society

52
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.970 
because all in all these
parts we make use of

53
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.210 
the internet and so for
attackers it's the possibility

54
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.030 
to interact with
this and to attack

55
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.280 
such usage of the internet.
Estimations say companies

56
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.810 
suffer damages of more
than 400 billion

57
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.140 
annually, this is really difficult
to estimate. Many people are

58
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.060 
not aware not even aware
that they are attacked,

59
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.450 
they do not become aware
that their data were

60
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.770 
stolen or that other damage was
done. In contrast the number

61
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.340 
of people that

62
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.230 
are active and know how
to secure computers

63
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.540 
is not increasing
in this regard

64
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.530 
and what we see also,
there are many people

65
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.630 
that do not be aware of this
problem, that do not spend the

66
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.300 
necessary attention to this
topic, to computer security

67
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.320 
topics, to secure and
protect their computers

68
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.550 
connected to the internet to
secure and protect their

69
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.070 
smartphones and others. So
compared to the huge amount

70
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.380 
of damage there is only a
relatively small amount

71
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.270 
of money which is spent
for security systems -

72
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.030 
anti-virus software
or others firewalls

73
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.440 
CMs intrusion detection
system and others.

74
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.640 
This is an important
problem,

75
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.850 
internet users awareness for such
security relevant question

76
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.250 
is generally insufficient.
Our idea with the course is

77
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.000 
to show where are the dangers
in using the internet

78
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.230 
to make you more aware what's going
on and support you in securing

79
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.790 
your system. Of course the IT
security is a huge field

80
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.090 
with many many aspects. There are
security of computer centers -

81
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.490 
computer centers
where people can

82
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.240 
do their computational
task, where cloud

83
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.970 
software is running. So one has
to take care for the physical

84
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.220 
access, one has to protect
from fire and others.

85
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.440 
Systems and application which
are run in this group need

86
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.410 
to be protected, the hardware need
to be protected, the operating

87
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.190 
systems need to be protected,
the services programming

88
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.020 
need to be secured. Network
security this is the focus and

89
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.350 
the aspect to protect
the services

90
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.640 
and the data that are
accessible through a network

91
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.610 
like the internet or mobile
security is another aspect which

92
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.370 
particularly concentrates on
the protection of mobile

93
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.370 
devices, of the usage of mobile
networks which become more

94
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.670 
and more popular. And
internet security -

95
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.530 
this is the protection of all
kinds of internet based systems

96
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.850 
and all kind of internet
based applications

97
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.910 
in your browser or in your
server, with the content,

98
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.390 
with the data, with the
services that may be used.

99
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.940 
And then a particular
aspect is the aspect

100
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.490 
to secure information, information
in the face of processing

101
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.080 
in the information when
they are transported

102
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.160 
over networks (open networks)
like the internet.

103
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.890 
So to protect the data,
protect the information

104
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.980 
with this and there

105
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.800 
the mean to do this
is encryption

106
00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.640 
of the data. In our course
we mainly focus on the

107
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.620 
internet security and different
aspects of the internet security.

108
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.950 
But we will see that we strive
for all the other aspects

109
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.760 
for our purpose.

110
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:22.920 
In this week we provide
material and we'll discuss

111
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.820 
and start with an overview
over the internet and web

112
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.510 
blue prints, we will take
a closer look why

113
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.940 
the internet is a target for
cyber crimes, we will discuss

114
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.490 
risk when using the internet,
when using IT systems, when

115
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.560 
using internet but also
when using intranets

116
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.360 
and then we form a general
idea about cybercrime.

117
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.780 
The offenders and the motifs
and common attacks.

118
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.520 
Then we finish the week

119
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.360 
with the history of
cybercrime and

120
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.530 
close with security
aims and requirements

121
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:19.130 
to discuss what are the goals
we have in mind when we speak

122
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.490 
of protecting
the internet.

123
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.000 
There are some literature
available for our openHPI course -

124
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.240 
internet security, this is
a Springer published

125
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.150 
book about digital communication
from Harald Sack and myself.

126
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.700 
There are other books for example
internetworking, web technology

127
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.410 
which form a triple

128
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.440 
about internet
technology.

129
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:51.220 
And then there is unfortunately
only in German language,

130
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.080 
also a small booklet about
security and trust

131
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.740 
in the internet that
gives an introduction

132
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.520 
to security and encryption.
We hope you will stay with

133
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.160 
us and will go through
the materials

134
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.690 
that are provided this
week. Please actively use

135
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.060 
the discussion board to
interact with other learners

136
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.080 
and finish your work
with the homework

137
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.860 
to collect the necessary points
to get the certificates.

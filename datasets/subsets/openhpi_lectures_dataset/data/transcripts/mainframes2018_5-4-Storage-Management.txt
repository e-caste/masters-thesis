1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.769 
Yeah, hello again and welcome back to a few video

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.719 
clips concerning storage, management, storage management, especially

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.879 
automatic storage management is a very important part of

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.499 
the mainframe environment, because we have to deal with a lot

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.269 
of storage in between, especially in

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.399 
mainsframe environments. Here we have the so-called storage hierarchy.

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.579 
I think you've seen this pyramid before.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.729 
We start at the top with CPU cache.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.130 
CPU cache, you can't

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.679 
order a certain amount of cache.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.209 
It's included into the architecture, depending on what model

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.579 
you order at IBM.

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.289 
And those are all cash is an architectural

14
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.309 
issue. You can have all different cache capacities.

15
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.179 
But when we start with main storage, of course, you can order

16
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.569 
different capacity of main storage.

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.189 
And it's important because today we want to have

18
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.359 
each and every important activity within the main storage.

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.579 
We don't want to page anymore.

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.289 
It's just for having updates of

21
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.909 
all the information we work with during our daily

22
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.349 
work. Then we have Flash Express and on the level

23
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.209 
below we have DASD cache means again caching environment

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.649 
for all the data that goes to a

25
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.599 
disk subsystem.

26
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.129 
And as a second possibility, we have solid state disk at

27
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.899 
this level. And the level below is DASD

28
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.379 
environments with different speed and capacity.

29
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.539 
Normally today, it's so-called disk subsystems

30
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.009 
that are controlled in such an

31
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.749 
environment. And on the lowest level within this hierarchy,

32
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.149 
we have tapes in different flavors.

33
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.679 
Normally today, Robota systems are installed and

34
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.359 
very important technology today is also virtual tape systems,

35
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.159 
virtual tape systems means so that the user does not have to know if

36
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.599 
the information is to physically put on tape or

37
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.619 
if it's held on disks.

38
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.019 
It's a black box for the users.

39
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.729 
That's why it's called virtual tape system, user thinks

40
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.529 
he writes to a tape, but if it's really written to tape is decided by this

41
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.709 
black box. And within the storage heirarchy

42
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.147 
as higher the level, the smaller,

43
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.199 
faster and more expensive are the storage

44
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.599 
media. And on the other side, if you do it the other way around as

45
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.309 
lower in this hierarchy, as bigger,

46
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.759 
slower and cheaper is the media.

47
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.249 
And you have one important line.

48
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.529 
It's the channel interface.

49
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.089 
So all what is going below mainstage storage and Flash Express is

50
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.619 
treated as i/o and i/o is

51
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.089 
very intense and

52
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.909 
very many things have to do to start i/os and so on.

53
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.999 
So normally we try to avoid i/os we come to that in a later

54
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.829 
video clip. OK, so the goals

55
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.839 
of storage management, in fact, is that all is automatic means automatic

56
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.729 
management of this storage hierarchy and storage management

57
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.469 
should place data where it's most appropriate

58
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.629 
to during the life of the years the data.

59
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.361 
We have all the automatic backup and recovery,

60
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.429 
recovery of course, not automatic, but it has to be easy.

61
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.679 
Back up has to be automatic means.

62
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.359 
If you work with data set, you can expect that each and every day

63
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.799 
a backup is taken. And in contrast to the past, where each and

64
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.756 
every day all the disk were dumped

65
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.379 
with, the full capacity. So it's no longer feasible.

66
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.909 
Not to mention manageable, because today we have petabytes

67
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.409 
of data installed in a mainframe

68
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.849 
environment. And so today we talk about incremental

69
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.199 
backups. Incremental backups mean that only data is backed up that

70
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.819 
has changed since the last day.

71
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.999 
And this is also an important improvement.

72
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.560 
The idea is the better use of storage media

73
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.509 
should be always available.

74
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.159 
It's controlled by parameters we defined

75
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.259 
concerning storage management.

76
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.939 
We reduce the administration efforts of

77
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.679 
storage management, and we release users with storage

78
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.519 
management, environment relief users from physical view of data sets.

79
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.989 
Or in the past, the users had to know how many track cylinders and

80
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.129 
so on. They have to allocate to work with data today.

81
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.659 
They can do it with kilobytes and megabytes and that's much more easy for

82
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.749 
users to understand. In contrast to

83
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.369 
think about how many tracks are needed, what is the track capacity, how many cylinders

84
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.370 
and so on.

85
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.119 
System cares also about physical location.

86
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.769 
Those data is put with the storage

87
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.469 
management things, it's the best place.

88
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.850 
Depending on of course some rules and, and

89
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.109 
definitions made to the storage management.

90
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.759 
And the idea is also to better use

91
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.329 
tape volumes. I mentioned on the file before that today we have

92
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.819 
virtual tape systems, so it's also managed by

93
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.889 
this storage management environment.

94
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.559 
And the really important thing to understand compared to the

95
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.119 
past, when we started with mainframe environments, we didn't have this

96
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.189 
storage management. So the users have to think by themselves about

97
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.019 
where they put the data on which disk, they put the data and this is

98
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.079 
no longer manageable.

99
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.200 
So our storage management deals with automatic

100
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.809 
control of these storage heirarachy, and automatically put

101
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.059 
the data on the level which is most appropriate.

102
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.009 
And sometimes maybe a user has to wait a few seconds

103
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.229 
because the data is on a lower level within this hierarchy and have to put

104
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.789 
up to the disk level and on the disk

105
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.529 
level then it's accessible from the

106
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.999 
applications and for the tiers or users and

107
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000 
so on.

108
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.959 
DFSMS has different components, the most important component

109
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.669 
included into the operating system is dfp (date of

110
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.739 
facility product).

111
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.179 
This is part of the data management which belongs to the operating system.

112
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.889 
And then we have some additional products as an example, one

113
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.279 
is the DSS (Dataset Services).

114
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.970 
It's a component which moves data from

115
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:11.229 
disk to tape. As example, it is so-called data move on in the

116
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:16.239 
SMS environment. And the other very important component

117
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.369 
is hierarchical storage manager.

118
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.839 
And as the name states, this is a component to defining or

119
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.349 
controlling the storage hierarchy.

120
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.789 
And as I already stated, the most important idea

121
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:36.189 
is that it's done automatically and no longer

122
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.548 
by hand as we did it 20 years ago.

123
00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.535 
And the last component which belongs to the Storage

124
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.269 
management subsystem is rmm, rmm stands for

125
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.939 
removable media manager. It's a component controlling all the

126
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.519 
tape environments.

127
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.629 
We will talk about these components during the next video clips.

128
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.159 
One main focus will be on the hierarchical storage manager, because this

129
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.989 
is the most important part for the users to understand when they work in a mainframe

130
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.639 
environment. Yeah.

131
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.649 
Have fun with storage management.

132
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.650 
Thank you very much.

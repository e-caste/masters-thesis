Hello, my name is Shun Arima, i'm a phd candidate of Keio University Graduate

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.240 
School of Media Design.
here i would work to introduce our research.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.640 
nowadays many running environments around the world are rapidly moving online,

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.340 
on the other hand it is not enough to simply copy the traditional classroom residence

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.490 
to provide runners with a satisfactory running experience.

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.450 
instructors need to go beyond simply copying a classroom residence
and redesign them

7
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
for their own write environment.

8
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.720 
our team has tried to combine new content with remote face-to-face

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.510 
sessions as a way to do that redesign.

10
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.920 
in this case we developed the correct content on the future and platform.

11
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.870 
this is because the contents developed in this effort can be

12
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.480 
used for future MOOC contents.
from here i will describes have specifically designed.

13
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.530 
the graduate school crust to really design.
this time was originally

14
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.610 
across four running software design methodologies which consist of eight

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
ninety minutes crosses. across was our universe style with seven

16
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
guest speakers each teaching one lesson.
this design was done in five steps.

17
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.830 
these in particular the content creation process
move the flexibly between the steps.

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.780 
in the pre-planning, only the minimum content was decided.

19
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.860 
After this step we did not yet decided on the structure with a course.

20
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.960 
But prioritize filming for the guest speakers fast

21
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.520 
in the make resources steps.
We filmed two hours each of o'brien

22
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.550 
and online interviews with seven guest speakers

23
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.060 
after filming all the interviews were transcript,

24
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.990 
since transcription tasks are long time.

25
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.250 
We went ahead on the road down the topics on the time stamps.

26
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.630 
these process are out the instructor and editing staff to smoothly

27
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.060 
grasp the contents of the interviews.

28
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.430 
with these resources we worked on construction of the interview resources

29
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.940 
for seven people were divided into short videos on the articles

30
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.990 
which were distributed throughout the course.

31
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.240 
At this stage we had not yet edited the videos or written their articles.

32
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.500 
however, by writing down the topics on the time stamps we were

33
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.190 
able to understand the content of the resources,

34
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.230 
after the construction the editorial staff edited the videos

35
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.460 
under the interactive wrote the article.

36
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
after our production steps our review step was
conducted to make overall adjustments.

37
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.240 
these redesign tasks were done in about nine weeks.

38
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.620 
we then combined this MOOC-like content with remote face to face

39
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.110 
sessions for two graduate school classes in the spring and

40
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.060 
the fall of 2020.

41
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.580 
finally based on interviews with the instructor and the students we for the

42
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.700 
findings of this effort regarding the development started with this time.

43
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.840 
the instructor said preparing the resources for us made its

44
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.980 
work go smoothly.
the instructor also mentioned that MOOC-like

45
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.690 
content is very useful for students to reflect on their future running.

46
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.180 
the students who took this class mentioned that MOOC-like content was benefit

47
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.270 
in that they could move back and forth between the steps.

48
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.990 
they also cited other advantages such as the ability to think

49
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.250 
at their own pace and ask questions easily.

50
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.220 
in the future we plan to correct and analyze more detailed data.

51
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.260 
the MOOC-like content we created this time is now available as a MOOC

52
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.400 
on future our methodology for design. If you are interested, please take the course.

53
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.710 
that's all. thank you for watching.

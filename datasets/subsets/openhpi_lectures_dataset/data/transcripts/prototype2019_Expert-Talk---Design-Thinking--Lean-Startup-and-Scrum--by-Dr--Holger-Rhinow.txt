00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.910 
Welcome everyone! My name is
Holger Rhinow. I'm a former

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.220 
researcher here at the
Hasso Plattner Institute,

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.040 
and I'm now in charge of running
design thinking and innovation

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.960 
projects. In my work here I am
confronted with a lot of different

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.280 
agile approaches that we
combine. The most famous ones

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.500 
and the most used ones for us are
design thinking, lean startup,

7
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.840 
and scrum. In fact, as I said, they
are all agile approaches. Why

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.260 
agile? These approaches have
built-in mechanisms to sense

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.240 
information and adapt to these
information while you're working.

10
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.780 
Agile, in its essence, means there
is a person that builds something

11
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.900 
for someone, a user. And instead
of relying on a feeling or an

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.890 
experience, that designer or
developer will constantly bring

13
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
incremental versions of
her idea to that user

14
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.900 
to get feedback. We call
this, 'show, don't tell!'

15
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
If something is useful for a
customer, continue working on it.

16
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.670 
Otherwise adapt or stop working
on it. This is really tricky

17
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.090 
in reality. Understanding users and
building solutions to problems

18
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
that are unknown to users is
something no organisation can

19
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
guarantee to deliver. When we explore
new business opportunities,

20
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.790 
we deal with risks. We don't
know a lot of aspects

21
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.630 
that will eventually define
success or failure.

22
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.660 
Agile work, therefore, means
to reduce risk step by step,

23
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.070 
through learning and
gaining more knowledge,

24
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.520 
from exploring opportunities
to developing products.

25
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
Once we figured out a
formula that works,

26
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.270 
we focus on operational excellence
by gaining efficiency and

27
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.680 
scale. But this is a
totally different game

28
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.390 
that is not typically done
in an agile manner.

29
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.210 
Exploring new opportunities is
risky because we don't know

30
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.260 
what customers want, nor do we know
whether we can build a business

31
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.760 
around it. We also don't know
the technological complexity.

32
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.550 
Agile approaches help us
in dealing with risk,

33
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.050 
through design thinking,
lean startup, and scrum.

34
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.820 
They all emerged independently
from each other and are similar

35
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.100 
in many ways. But they also have
different key characteristics

36
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.490 
that kind of complement each
other. And successful companies

37
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.540 
apply agile approaches
therefore sequentially.

38
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.340 
Starting with design
thinking or lean startup,

39
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.390 
and then continuing with scrum.
Now, design thinking is about

40
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.620 
exploring a problem and a solution
space, through fast prototyping

41
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.540 
and continuous user feedback.
Once we figure out what users

42
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.500 
really need, we can translate our
new knowledge into a so-called

43
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.190 
product backlog, the starting point
to develop a product with scrum.

44
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.000 
Lean startup emerged in the
venture capital world.

45
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.400 
It's there to prepare startups
for better pitches.

46
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.780 
Startups normally start with an
idea, and the intention in

47
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.200 
mind to build a business. What they
need to do fast is to explore

48
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.920 
the idea's business potential. Lean
startup is a way of experimenting,

49
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.620 
to minimize business risk
before actually building

50
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.570 
the business.

51
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.320 
Scrum is the answer to an increasing
number of complex software

52
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.120 
projects that failed in the
context of traditional project

53
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.260 
management. Scrum teams often
develop solutions based

54
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.210 
on the first product vision.
These teams work in sprints and

55
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.990 
periodically review their results
based on customer feedback.

56
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.510 
That way they stay open for
changes, they adapt to customer

57
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.620 
insights but they already focus on
developing a shipable product.

58
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.720 
There are in fact more agile
approaches out there that follow

59
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.200 
a similar pattern, and that is always
stay open, and adapt to change.

60
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.330 
The differences between all of them
seem like details, but matter

61
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.370 
a lot. Design thinking, lean
startup, and scrum all enabled

62
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.810 
agile team performances. But these
performances result in very

63
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.250 
different dynamics and outcomes.
And innovative companies like

64
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.180 
IBM have understood this and combine
these approaches. And what

65
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.890 
we see these days, more and more
companies, not just big companies

66
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.680 
but also medium-sized companies
and smaller companies,

67
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.090 
start to play around with these
agile approaches, start to

68
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.340 
figure out how they can
combine them in a way to

69
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.400 
enable faster and more efficient
innovation development.

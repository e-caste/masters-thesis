00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.380 
Welcome back! You have now framed your
problem from the user's perspective

2
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.400 
and you've created your &amp;quot;How
Might We&amp;quot; question.

3
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.230 
So now it's time to generate a lot of
ideas for the new problem you have.

4
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.240 
So the first step of this phase
is to come up with a lot of

5
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.490 
creative ideas for your &amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot;
question using different brainstorming techniques.

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.390 
Our goal here is to
generate a lot of ideas.

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.130 
So we're aiming for quantity
not quality here.

8
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.190 
We will have some time to
evaluate our ideas later.

9
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.100 
During this module we'll share some of our
favorite brainstorming techniques with you.

10
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.020 
It's very important for a
productive and active

11
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.720 
brainstorming session that a
team has a good facilitator.

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.380 
So in this week we also give you
some advice on how to facilitate

13
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.040 
a brainstorming session. In the
assignment you'll get to facilitate

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.900 
your own idea generation. So
remember that you will need

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.000 
a team of at least three persons
for this, and you might already

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.900 
want to consider to fix a
date and space for this.

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.430 
After coming up with ideas
it's time to evaluate them.

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.690 
So we will share some tools
and techniques that

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.800 
we like for selecting ideas
and evaluating them.

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.870 
And finally in this week we have a
podcast about the theory behind

21
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.850 
brainstorming for those of
you who are interested.

22
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.950 
So we hope you'll enjoy and learn
something new in this module.

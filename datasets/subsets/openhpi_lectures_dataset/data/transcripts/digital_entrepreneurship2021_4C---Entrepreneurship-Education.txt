00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.500 
Welcome. Welcome to this session
on Entrepreneurship Education.

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:20.380 
What is entrepreneurship education and can you
actually educate and teach entrepreneurship?

3
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
Well, we think so, yes. And we actually not only
think that entrepreneurship can be taught,

4
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.260 
it can be learned and
it can so, by everyone

5
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.360 
and anyone. You and me and everyone.
So it's not something that

6
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.220 
you're born with, it's not something
that is been given to you by birth.

7
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.550 
It can be learned and if it can
be learned it can actually

8
00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.330 
been taught by others. So, what we understand
by entrepreneurial thinking and acting

9
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.240 
is exactly that. It is changing
the way we think and act in

10
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.120 
our daily lives, in our professional
lives and everywhere. So

11
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.170 
this entrepreneurial thinking and acting
is actually changing the way

12
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.580 
business but also society is
conducted in every level.

13
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.150 
And obviously, we hope that you see
it in this way too. Otherwise

14
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.630 
you wouldn't be with us in this
MOOC. So, let's take a closer

15
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.900 
look what exactly this entrepreneurship
education actually is.

16
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:48.160 
There is quite some research on whether formal
entrepreneurship education actually influences

17
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.510 
the entrepreneurial success. And
there are some researchers

18
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.830 
who say yes, and they provide data
and results which shows that

19
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.910 
this is the case. But there are also
other studies that actually show that

20
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.750 
there is not such a high correlation
between entrepreneurship

21
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.560 
education and entrepreneurial success.

22
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.330 
However, what most of the studies
show that if you learn about

23
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.710 
instruments and methods and processes in
entrepreneurship, that will help you

24
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.650 
to be better on your way and that will
actually develop an entrepreneurial mindset

25
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.780 
which helps you to also see your
life in a different way. So,

26
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
using different
pedagogical methods

27
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.850 
can help you to develop these competences
to actually develop this mindset of

28
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.240 
okay, it's about failure, it's about skills,
I have to look out for opportunities,

29
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.290 
to impose change in a given situation.
It can also teach you how

30
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.040 
to be competitive and how to stay
competitive. It can show you

31
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.730 
how to share ideas and give you
those different perspectives

32
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.270 
on the way of how to think
and act entrepreneur.

33
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.730 
So this is on a
very individual

34
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.720 
level. Now you might ask
yourself, so who is actually

35
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.250 
that person or that organization
that can teach entrepreneurship?

36
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.710 
And as we are part of a university,
obviously we believe that

37
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.840 
universities can be a very good
place to learn and to teach

38
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.360 
entrepreneurship education. And
why is that the case? Because

39
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.660 
there are students coming to
universities and by university

40
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.260 
I not only mean those physical
institutions. I mean you and

41
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.370 
me and we are all now in a kind
of virtual university because

42
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.250 
you listen to our class on Digital
Entrepreneurship and you learn about

43
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.570 
digital entrepreneurship in this
course. So basically this is

44
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.160 
also about developing new ideas,
skills and entrepreneurial talent.

45
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.870 
At the same time, universities can
actually extend their capabilities

46
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.650 
of how to teach entrepreneurship. So we do this through
entrepreneurship programs, incubation programs,

47
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.750 
we develop new training modules at
interdisciplinary entrepreneurship

48
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.820 
centers or science parks. There are
more and more academic spin-offs

49
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.820 
but also incubators coming to universities
and also obviously venture capital firms.

50
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.120 
So universities are not
only a source for ideas;

51
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.860 
they are actually combining their
research and teaching capabilities

52
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.980 
in these new formats to become a
source of new firm formation

53
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.010 
and by this really driving regional
development but also countrywide

54
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:19.150 
development for entrepreneurship. So the
OECD once put all of these different

55
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.820 
things universities can do, an
entrepreneurship education should

56
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.690 
do together in five important
things. So first of all it's

57
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.020 
about aligning. It's about aligning the
graduate students with the entrepreneurs

58
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.700 
and the entrepreneurship training with
the regional industry development.

59
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.020 
So, it is bringing those different
stakeholders together.

60
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.830 
At the same time, its about embedding.
It's about embedding skills,

61
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.760 
work-based learning, internship,
entrepreneurialism in all curricula

62
00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.820 
and that also shows you that
entrepreneurship is a learning journey. So,

63
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.980 
if you're working on an organization
or in a company, yes entrepreneurship

64
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.920 
is a skill that can be learned.
However it needs to be embedded

65
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:19.280 
in that overall curriculum. It's about creating.
It's about creating learning pathways

66
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.320 
from primary school, from elementary
school up to lifelong learning because

67
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.980 
we all know by now, it's not only
the digital technologies. It's

68
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
the whole world that is
changing in a permanent

69
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.630 
course. It's pretty fast paced and if we
want to stay on top of these developments,

70
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.330 
we have to life long learn. And
having an entrepreneurial mindset,

71
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.530 
knowing where to look for
opportunities, how to detect them,

72
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
how to actually encounter them, will
help you to be better equipped

73
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.090 
for this life long learning journey.

74
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.390 
It also develops
the student

75
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.520 
perspectives and the overall macro-
perspective on how our markets develop. So

76
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.470 
this is the fourth important
pillar. And the fifth one, it's

77
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.210 
obviously, it's not only universities.
It is companies, it is

78
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.960 
organizations, it is schools, it
is MOOCs like this one that

79
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:32.300 
actually create a link between entrepreneurship,
between development and business creation.

80
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.350 
So far so good. So how does it
exactly look like? Now you're

81
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.180 
part of our MOOC on digital
entrepreneurship and you might

82
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.950 
know by now that we
are focusing on providing you

83
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.280 
with a big picture of what
digital entrepreneurship is.

84
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:58.820 
If you're interested to really do and
conduct this entrepreneurial journey,

85
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.690 
there are many other classes available, and
for example we at University of Potsdam

86
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.050 
have developed our own entrepreneurship
education model which

87
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.030 
you can see on the slide. And what
you can see, it is a continuous

88
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.740 
learning journey as I just mentioned
from recognising the opportunities,

89
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.940 
empathizing with the user's needs,
defining your business ideas

90
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.320 
and then actually ideate and
build your own venture. And you

91
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.350 
will find this process in the session
on the entrepreneurial process

92
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.530 
where we will give
you some more details on how

93
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:42.610 
this process looks like and how
that actually helps you to

94
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:49.840 
train your entrepreneurial mindset. And
it is as it is with every muscle -

95
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.070 
training leads to performance. So you
can train your entrepreneurial

96
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.550 
muscle and it will lead
you to create an

97
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:06.040 
entrepreneurial world that actually
solves the challenges that lay ahead.

98
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.720 
So let's embark
on that journey.

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.770 
Let's speak about eavesdropping
on the internet.

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.010 
eavesdropping, that means
listening to data packets,

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.520 
which are sent over the open
communication channels

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.480 
of the internet of an open
network with the goal of

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.980 
collecting data, to obtain data
and confidential information,

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.730 
which are sent in the data
packet. you asked why

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.650 
and how could it be possible?
yeah, remember the data packets

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.770 
are routed during the transport
from the sender to the receiver

9
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.980 
by several intermediate systems.
With our intermediate system,

10
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.190 
which makes a decision how to
transport the data into the

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.880 
next neighbour system and
with the goal to finally

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.360 
send the data package to the receiver.
these intermediate systems

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.440 
they can be intercepted by attackers.
they are also eavesdropping

14
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.200 
programs in place called sniffers.
of course, this sniffers.

15
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.100 
our programs, which were not
designed for attackers,

16
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.790 
but are designed to intercept
data packets on the internet

17
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.080 
to find out failures or
problems in the network.

18
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
so actually, conceiving are
designed for diagnosing

19
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.700 
the problem to use the
networks, for network

20
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.280 
problems and of course
it was not designed

21
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.000 
as an attack tool. but, of course,
attackers use such kind of

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.930 
program to eavesdrop
data in the internet.

23
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.340 
the sniffers can be run in different
operation modes. There is

24
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.580 
a direct mode. the direct mode
displays only that data packets,

25
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.510 
which are dressed to and
which originating from

26
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.470 
the intermediate system on which
the sniffer is installed.

27
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.620 
but, beside direct mode,
sniffers can also be operated

28
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.820 
in the promiscuous mode. and
in the promiscuous mode,

29
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.910 
the sniffers play
all data packets,

30
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.260 
that are routed through
the immediate system

31
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.040 
on which the sniffer is installed.
that not only the data packet

32
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.510 
from the specific system.,but
also data package that

33
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.690 
run and transported through
the intermediate system.

34
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.170 
so if the sniffer is installed at
strategic points in the internet,

35
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.410 
then, of course ,it will
see all the data packets

36
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.830 
that are sent on the
internet through

37
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.560 
that station to that
strategic point.

38
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.870 
and not only the data packages
sent or received by one machine.

39
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.760 
so sniffers intercept
huge amount of data,

40
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.060 
but the search is very
complex. so the idea

41
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.520 
to misuse such sniffer
programs for attackers

42
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.750 
is, to filter the data that
are collected. for example,

43
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.600 
to look for a specific sender,
or to look and to search for a

44
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.430 
specific recipient, to look for a
special protocol, that is used

45
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
or special port. port is
the gate ,is the entrance

46
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.570 
point to certain applications.
or for example, to filter for

47
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.260 
specific context. there are
specialized eavesdropping programs

48
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.220 
which surface into data packets for
example, for specific contents.

49
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.740 
for patterns, for specific
sequence of the

50
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.520 
letters, for example,
they look for password,

51
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.230 
or they look for user
name. Cain&amp; Abel

52
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.280 
is such a tool. the most
populous sniffer is Wireshark.

53
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.730 
and here is the interface,
the graphical

54
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.920 
user interface, which shows the
different stations and which

55
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.250 
kind of protocols is used and
give some information of what

56
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.610 
is done. so with such
type of powerful tool,

57
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.220 
it's easy for attackers to eavesdrop
or what's going to sent,

58
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.780 
what is sent and who's doing that. they
are many different eavesdropping

59
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.980 
attacks scenarios. for example,
sniffing http passwords. http

60
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.220 
hypertext transfer protocol, the
a application protocol for

61
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.680 
the wide web. and for many
applications a in the

62
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.520 
world wide web, the password
is needed. so http,

63
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.940 
which is responsible for all the
data transport in the world

64
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.130 
wide web, since passwords
in plain text. so

65
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.520 
the design of the protocol makes
the sniffer can read plaintext

66
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.540 
passwords and user names
and then directly

67
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.460 
from the corresponding data packets,
and later, it is possible

68
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.240 
the data can be misused. another
eavesdropping attack scenario is

69
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.700 
to sniff session keys. so web pages
use session keys to recognize and

70
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.960 
remember logged user. so for example,
if the user is doing online

71
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.230 
shopping he is doing some activity
and he is wait some moments to

72
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.210 
find out some more information,
than he come back

73
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.760 
and with a session
key, the servers

74
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.550 
can recognize and can
remember the user.

75
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.930 
for example,session key can be
read from an http packet.

76
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.700 
here is http: bank.comtransf?session,
and this is a

77
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.610 
session key what's a
transmitted in the ul.

78
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.570 
and this allows the attackers
to take over secession key

79
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.510 
with it to take secession
key and then to take over

80
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.600 
the connection without further
lock-in. because the session

81
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.930 
key to create the session
key, this is one of the

82
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.680 
thing that is done in
the look in process.

83
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.630 
they are more attacks
scenarios. for example spying

84
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.950 
on the web page which
are visited by user.

85
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.990 
so http queries display the
web page that are visited.

86
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.660 
so interested attackers can see
all the pages that visited

87
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.570 
by user, and he
can see also

88
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.240 
key words which are added
in different forms

89
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.050 
for webservice. it's
also possible to see

90
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.860 
the content of the page
that are visited.

91
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.270 
and this gives the attacker
an idea about more specific

92
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.750 
knowledge about the user
which he or she later

93
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.480 
can misuse. reading of e-mails it's another
attack scenario in our eavesdropping.

94
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.410 
attackers use the email protocol
SMTP. SMTP is unencrypted.

95
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.510 
so as the attackers can read all the
emails. you should be aware of

96
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.610 
this fact when you are sending
email. so what are the protection

97
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.400 
measures against eavesdropping
in the internet?

98
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.440 
basic protection measures
is encryption.

99
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.610 
encryption of messages
and connections.

100
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.340 
so use instead of HTTP to
secure variants of https,

101
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.010 
this http over TSL/SSL. so the
attacker are can sniffs the

102
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.490 
data, can eavesdrop
the data but

103
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.800 
he cannot understand. he cannot
understand the content, he cannot

104
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:16.610 
read password or to use it. so
listening to and interpreting

105
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.070 
well encrypted connections
is almost impossible

106
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.750 
with a correct implementation. and
another protection measure is

107
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.830 
strong authentication. and strong
authentication that we discussed

108
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.830 
already can be a are
reached by multi-

109
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.410 
fact authentication. so as in
this situation attackers can

110
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:43.840 
not directly use further log in.
and multi-factor authentication

111
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.020 
requires for example the
possession of a smart card

112
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.250 
as one element and
the second factor,

113
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.090 
the PIN to use
the smart card.

114
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.600 
so eavesdrop passwords
are, therefore,unless

115
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.430 
because a card
is needed.

116
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.990 
so you see there's a
variety of protection

117
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.870 
against eavesdropping. the
important is that you are aware

118
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.620 
in that internet is an open net. it
is an open network and everyone

119
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.510 
who has access to the
internet can also see

120
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.160 
its information that is
sent over the internet.

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.850 
Ok. As we said in the last video,
we need to install a couple of

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.350 
things. We're going to
install the Java JDK,

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.750 
this is the Java development
toolkit and it basically

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.760 
comes along with programs
that let you compile

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.870 
and create actual programs
on your local machine.

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.180 
We need to install the JDK and then of
course we need to install Eclipse.

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.230 
You can install whichever
IDE you want

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.640 
but we will show you
Eclipse. You already have

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.950 
something to run
Java, so on most

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.780 
computers the JRE, the java
runtime environment is already

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.330 
pre-installed and we're going to
install the JDK additionally.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.330 
So you don't need, and you
shouldn't un-install the JRE.

13
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
They are not going to
interfere with each other.

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.150 
We're just going to install the
JDK and where do we get it?

15
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.150 
So let's have a look at the web
page where we can get that,

16
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.980 
and you will get the link where you'll
find it below this video, as we

17
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.190 
do that always.

18
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.190 
You just the JDK that works
with your system. So you

19
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.680 
need to know which system
you're using, i mean

20
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
that should be Windows,
MacOS, or Linux.

21
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.820 
If you happen to have Solaris you
should know what you're doing.

22
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.960 
The one thing
that you need

23
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.240 
to do is, you need to to
accept the license agreement

24
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.080 
before that. We already
did that that's why the

25
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.130 
radio button has
disappeared.

26
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.350 
For you, probably, there
will be a radio button.

27
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.090 
You need to check that. Before you've
done that, nothing will work.

28
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.870 
Just download it
and install it.

29
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.560 
It looks a little different for each
platform, so we're not going to show

30
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.130 
you that, but there's not
much to do wrong there.

31
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.170 
And if you run into any problems,
just go to the forum,

32
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.190 
and ask for it or google for it or
discuss it with the other participants.

33
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.190 
Because often everybody will have the
same problems if there were any.

34
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.610 
Next thing we're
going to install is

35
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.210 
Eclipse. Eclipse is the Java IDE that we will
be using, as we said in the last video.

36
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
And as you can see
there's a couple

37
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.840 
of versions of

38
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.510 
this IDE. And we will use the
Eclipse IDE for Java developers.

39
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.190 
All the other versions come with
additional tooling bundled,

40
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.970 
which we won't need for

41
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.880 
this workshop. If you are
already have another

42
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.560 
version of Eclipse installed
its fine to use that.

43
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.160 
But if you're going to install
Eclipse just for this

44
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.110 
workshop, choose the one
for Java developers.

45
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.680 
At least we recommend that
you choose that one.

46
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.070 
It comes with a git client, it
comes with all the things we need

47
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.860 
in order to do the things
we want to show you.

48
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.850 
Exactly, and so you have the
choice between several

49
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.200 
versions for several platforms,
operating systems,

50
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.190 
If there's a choice
between thirty-two bit

51
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.720 
and sixty-four bit, so if your
PC is not older than 10 years,

52
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.620 
then you should usually use
the sixty-four bit version.

53
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.520 
Exactly, so that's it.

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.740 
Welcome to video clip 1.6 in
which we discuss levels of process models.

2
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.440 
When we discuss business processes it's
not the case that we always look

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.600 
at the level of activities
and ordering of activities and

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.680 
who is responsible for which
activities and which decisions.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.900 
Since organization are complex
buildings and we need to

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.780 
have layers or different
levels in which we discuss

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.170 
business processes. This slide
shows these layers that we like to

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.010 
Differentiate, that we like
to discuss in this course.

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.920 
And on the upper level we have the
organizational business processes these are

10
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.990 
coarse grained business processes
are coarse grained entities

11
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.420 
that cover the main activities
of an organization.

12
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.980 
These organizational business
processes determine the operational

13
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.970 
business processes on the next
level the operational business

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.490 
processes actually cover the activities
the process activities and the logical

15
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.090 
ordering from a business perspective
not from a technical perspective.

16
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.980 
But the process models that we
have been looking at so far

17
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.270 
on the level of operational on business
processes, we look at activities the ordering

18
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.220 
and then also the responsibilities
which decisions occur and so forth.

19
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.310 
On the implementation level we have
implemented business processes

20
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.590 
and in the implemented business
processes we add execution

21
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.320 
information technical execution
information two operational

22
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.000 
business processes, also the process
structure might be more elaborate might be

23
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.270 
different than the structure of the
operational business processes.

24
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.200 
So let's start with the highest level with
the organizational business processes.

25
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.420 
They are often not defined and on
the model level on the level

26
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.740 
of BPMN or the level of
activities gateways decisions

27
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.360 
and so forth but they are defined
in a textual form often

28
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.600 
using a table structure. So for
each organizational business

29
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.490 
process we look at what are the inputs
what are the outputs of the process,

30
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.940 
which persons are responsible or which
roles are responsible for the process,

31
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.670 
which supplier or customer relationships exist
with other organizational business processes.

32
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.140 
And we can say that each organization has about
a dozen organization business processes.

33
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.060 
On the right-hand side we see an
example of this tabular

34
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.380 
structure of an organization
business process.

35
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.460 
Here we have the process
name which is the product

36
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.890 
development process. We see the person
who is responsible for this process,

37
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.530 
we see the inputs and outputs
in terms of what are the main

38
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.340 
artifacts produced during
that process, we look at the

39
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.960 
supplier process or processes that produce something
that the organizational business process

40
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.690 
expects or uses as input.

41
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.520 
The organizational business process
also produces results process

42
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.440 
results and these can then be fed into
other organizational business processes.

43
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.530 
And we have here also one customer process
which is the order management process.

44
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.140 
So this takes a look at one
particular organizational business

45
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
process and this is realized by
many many of operational business

46
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.850 
processes which then are realized
by implemented processes.

47
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.020 
Alright so here the focus is on one
organizational business process

48
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.080 
and we can draw a map of all organizational
business processes with their

49
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.160 
customer supplier relationships and
then we end up with a process

50
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.620 
landscape and this light
shows you process landscape.

51
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.060 
In the previous slide we had these
product development process and

52
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.460 
the organizational process
is on this slide

53
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.310 
represented by this symbol by
this symbol and there

54
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.600 
are other as you see there are
organizational business processes

55
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.990 
that is the innovation process, product
planning process, the marketing process

56
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.460 
or the management process, the
after-sales process. And we also see

57
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.570 
stakeholders that are not really
organizational

58
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.540 
business processes but this process
landscape shows that

59
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
the stakeholders have market challenges
and the market challenges

60
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.870 
are the output of the stakeholders. They
produce the market challenges and these

61
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.440 
market challenges are used as
input for the innovation process.

62
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.140 
The innovation produces a prototype of
prototypes and the prototypes are input

63
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.690 
to the product development process
and so forth. So these types

64
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.290 
of process landscapes provide
you a high level view of the

65
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.380 
organizational processes of your
company of your organization

66
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.440 
and how they relate
to each other.

67
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.790 
And this is also from the BPM book
and thereby is adapted from

68
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.140 
a very nice book by Schmelzer and
Sesselmann that appeared in

69
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.860 
2010.

70
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.410 
Alright on the next level the
operational business processes

71
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.870 
this is the level we will be
dealing mostly with. Here

72
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
process models are defined BPMN
process models are defined

73
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.200 
that focus on business aspects rather
than technical implementation aspects.

74
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.730 
So here we see activities and the
logical orderings seen before.

75
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.170 
We see organizational aspects. So far we have
only seen organizational aspects related

76
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.010 
to the organization
that is responsible here.

77
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.180 
We have the reseller and also
we have the insurance company

78
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.280 
and the customers and so forth.
But we will go a bit more

79
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.600 
detail into these organizational
aspects that are also covered

80
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.960 
in the operational business
processes. We see decision points

81
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.040 
responsibility and also we look at
the main data objects involved

82
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.280 
so this level also talks about
the data object that is

83
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.030 
created data objects that are
created during process execution

84
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.150 
and data objects that are saying read
and written during process execution.

85
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.460 
And operational business processes - here
we use graphical process modeling

86
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.750 
languages for
instance the BPMN.

87
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.770 
On the implementation level are
we well we see implemented

88
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.380 
business processes. Business
processes can be implemented in

89
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:51.100 
very many different ways. In
the earlier this week I was

90
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.780 
discussing business process
management systems that are generic

91
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.930 
software systems that take process
specification as process models

92
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.650 
and reached with execution
information and this makes sure

93
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.830 
these systems make sure that the
process instances are executed

94
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.300 
as defined by the process model using
process orchestration techniques.

95
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.610 
But that's not the only way that we can
implement business processes. We can

96
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.920 
implement business process also
using traditional techniques,

97
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.350 
with traditional software system,
with some kind of message passing,

98
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:31.400 
middleware underneath, we can use the ERP
system to implement business processes

99
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.250 
although the tailoring
of these systems might be a

100
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.570 
bit more complex, might

101
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.160 
might require a bit more coding
than when we use BPMS.

102
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.010 
In any case the business
implemented business processes

103
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.170 
contain detailed information
about the implementation

104
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.620 
of software systems and services are used
to implement the process activities.

105
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.340 
Also details regarding the
organizational aspects of

106
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.950 
the process implementation including
responsibilities and access

107
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.750 
rights of process participants needs
to be discussed, so it is not only though

108
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.650 
software the technical implementation but
also the implementation in the organization

109
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.830 
regarding responsibilities and process
participants, people responsible

110
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.280 
for certain activities or for
certain part of the process.

111
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.320 
And also implemented
processes contain details

112
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:31.600 
or additional details relative to
operational business processes but

113
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.010 
these processes can also
differ in structure from them.

114
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.680 
So we might have an ity architecture
that prevents us from implementing

115
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.120 
the business process in the same way
as the operational business process

116
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.380 
it is specified. So we
need to add additional

117
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:56.070 
activities we might also in some
cases to to delete activities

118
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.280 
we might reorder activities, so the
step from an from the operational

119
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.970 
business process to the implemented
business process is again

120
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.560 
a creative act is an implementation
act and this is not an

121
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.290 
automatic act that we can that
we can do by pressing a button.

122
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.070 
And in the lower part we see an
excerpt of a process specification

123
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.640 
using the activity open
source BPMN engine with

124
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.470 
which we have been

125
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.930 
which we use in classrooms and
which we also use no projects

126
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.590 
Alright that concludes video
clip 1.6 in which we

127
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.900 
discussed levels of
business processes.

128
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.890 
We discussed first the top
level of business process

129
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.150 
that is organizational business processes.
We can organize organizational

130
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:50.570 
business processes using process
landscapes which detail the

131
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.310 
organizational business
processes of the company and

132
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.880 
also the dependencies in terms
of input output on the

133
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.950 
high level of organizational
business processes.

134
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.040 
We then talked about operational
business processes mostly

135
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:10.650 
BPMN processes which are the center
of our attention in this course.

136
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.430 
And we briefly discussed implemented
business process so ways how

137
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.190 
operational business process can
be implemented using BPMS

138
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.690 
or using other types
of implementations.

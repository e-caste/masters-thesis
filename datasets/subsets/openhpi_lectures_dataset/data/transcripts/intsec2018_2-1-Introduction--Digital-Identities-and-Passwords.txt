1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.470 
Lets start with considering
digital identity

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.030 
and have a closer look to
passwords. When we ask how we can

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.870 
move around the internet and how
to prove where we are on the

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.720 
internet then we have to remind
what we do what we have to

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.910 
do before we start to use
an internet service.

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.060 
Before we can do online
shopping for example

7
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.240 
before we can download music or
before we can participate in

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.180 
openHPI course we
have to register.

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.820 
This registration is needed
and it's necessary for

10
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.890 
the service and the service
needs to be able to recognize

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.280 
the user to remember what the
user did to remember what

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.980 
kind of resources thr user is
allowed for example in the case

13
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.130 
of online shopping the shop
needs to know who is shopping

14
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.190 
who is downloading
music,

15
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.140 
where to deliver the purchase,
all this information that are

16
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.070 
needed to that end for example
also the information for which

17
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
account to debit the costs
or to whom the assig

18
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.490 
in our case of openHPI to
assigns the Quiz results

19
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.440 
information is needed
of the user.

20
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
The interface of the
registration technically

21
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.630 
this kind of information
is collected and

22
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.700 
the collection of this data
provides a so called

23
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.300 
digital identity a digital
identity of course that

24
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.950 
needs to be stored in the user
database of that service

25
00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.240 
so when the user next time come
by means of this digital

26
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.670 
identity can be indentified
who is the user.

27
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.510 
Digital identity is a
collection of electronic data

28
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.910 
collection that characterizes
a user that characterize

29
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.710 
a physical identity in the
internet so real person

30
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.510 
who want to shop online or
want to download music

31
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.630 
needs a digital identity and
needs such a digital identity

32
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
on site of each service
that he or she is using.

33
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.440 
Such digital identities
are characterized by

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.700 
a user name by an email address
by the residential address

35
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.410 
by an account number by a bank
account by for example insurance

36
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.110 
number or other things
and passwords.

37
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.350 
The user that means a physical
identity can be on the internet

38
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.320 
with many different digital identities
for each service and also

39
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.770 
collection of digital data can
be used to characterize the

40
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.180 
user so new data may be entered
from for each registration

41
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.080 
process for example
another username

42
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.560 
another bank account another
credit card another password.

43
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.120 
However so far as possible it is
always important to safeguard

44
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.110 
the link between the
digital identity and

45
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.850 
its user because the
user is who is moving

46
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.530 
in the digital world for shopping
for learning for other activities

47
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.540 
and if it's possible
that a third person

48
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.710 
misuses this digital
identity misuses means

49
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.140 
to use this identity
for the wrong person

50
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.760 
then misuse is possible. If
desired digital identity can

51
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.030 
also be obtained for a group of
users or even for other objects

52
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.680 
or services, entities to access
a service when we speak about

53
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.480 
internet of things then objects
need to be identified

54
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.220 
in the digital world. If
we look to our openHPI

55
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.890 
perhaps you remember
your registration

56
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.380 
before you start to use openHPI
there is a registration page

57
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.920 
and typically such a registration
page comes with a formular

58
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.610 
where you have to give in
here in our case first name

59
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.480 
surname email address
password, repeated password

60
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.300 
openHPI is for free if it
would be a service you have

61
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.030 
to pay then you have also to give
your bank account or your pay

62
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.910 
method and other information
and als this information

63
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.940 
this forms your digital identity
in the case of openHPI.

64
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.760 
In the user database of openHPI
this collection of data

65
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.920 
which characterizes u is stored
and if you come and if you

66
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.410 
start to work if you do homework
if you do a self test

67
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.350 
then the results is connected
with your identity in a sense

68
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.970 
that if you continue tomorrow
then the system exactly knows

69
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.210 
what you already
did and where you

70
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.460 
have to do the
next step.

71
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.040 
Access control this is tha
for digital identity

72
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.680 
which was established during
registration process

73
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.470 
needs to be clarified what
are the usage rights

74
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.890 
that are attributed to the
digital identity of the users

75
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.620 
that means what kind of
rights what kind of data

76
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.250 
the user, the physical user that
identified by its digital identity

77
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.620 
is allowed to access.
The usage rights

78
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.330 
technical we speak technically
we speak from permissions

79
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.560 
determine which of the
service resources

80
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.740 
the user connected to the digital
identity may use and which

81
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.170 
restrictions they are subject
to for example if we look

82
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.150 
to openHPI the question
what kind of videos are

83
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.020 
allowed to be comes to be
viewed how the access how

84
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.960 
the access is examined how
to create videos, quizzes

85
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.700 
for example (videos) to create
videos are allowed for

86
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.510 
the teaching team the
access to the exams

87
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.350 
are attributed and allowed to the
users so you see the digital

88
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.190 
the different users characterized
by their digital identity

89
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.910 
get different
permissions to use

90
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.270 
resources of the service
or to make use

91
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.420 
of this service. If you
speak about access control

92
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.370 
then typically this access
control considers

93
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.420 
he consists of two
closely linked phrases

94
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.680 
the first phase is the authentication,
the authentication for a service

95
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.280 
and here the user it
needs to be indentified

96
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:46.210 
the connection between the digital
identity and the physical

97
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.260 
user needs to be needs
to be find out.

98
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.170 
Precisely that means the
identification of a digital identity

99
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.800 
and thus if the users behind
the digital identity.

100
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.990 
After the user is authenticated
there is a next phase the

101
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.910 
authorization phase
and that phase

102
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.490 
it will be determined
which resources of

103
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.180 
the service the identified
user may use.

104
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.150 
When we speak it
more technically

105
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.930 
then what are the permissions
that are attributed to the

106
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.210 
digital identity
which were

107
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.050 
authenticated in
the first phase

108
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.650 
so what kind of data are
allowed this user belonging

109
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.970 
to this digital identity
is allowed to access

110
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.140 
what data he can read
what data he can write

111
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:56.560 
and other things. Now the question is
how to securely link this digital

112
00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:03.870 
identity to the human user
or to the object in the

113
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.700 
internet of things. An authentication
process in the physical

114
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.190 
world is quite easy you are a
human and physical identity

115
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.710 
is considered by humans

116
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.990 
the appearance, the hair
color, the face, the voice

117
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:28.210 
is recognized and then the human
can identify a person can

118
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.730 
authenticate a person by in
defining it's appearearance.

119
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.100 
In the real life there
are documents to

120
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.090 
for this authentication process
which helps the documents these

121
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.870 
documents they have a photo of users
so the appearance can be checked

122
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.880 
and such documents are identity
cards are passports, driving

123
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.570 
licenses or others. When we
do like to do something

124
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.280 
similar the digital
world when we

125
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.440 
want to authenticate someone
in the digital world

126
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.740 
we have to compare the digital
identity he with the user with

127
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.300 
the physical identity so
when the digital identity

128
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.520 
an account is set up this
can be linked to the user

129
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.810 
by means of passwords or
digital certificate

130
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.010 
by ownership of special smart cards,
fingerprint, facial recognition.

131
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.370 
You see like the identity
card like the passport help

132
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.530 
in the physical world
to identify a person

133
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.390 
in the digital world
we need help by

134
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.480 
password or certificate
or by a special

135
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.810 
property by a face or
fingerprint of the person.

136
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.710 
I already mentioned
the authentication

137
00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:02.900 
method to identify a user
by means of his password

138
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.920 
his username and password
is most common.

139
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.110 
What is the idea of the password,
the classification of the password

140
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:17.640 
is a common secret a common
secret between the service

141
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.470 
and inside of the service
there is a digital identity

142
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:29.510 
and the user of this digital
identity the system checks

143
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:35.040 
whether the real user belongs
to that digital identity

144
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:42.670 
by asking for that secret so
then authentication is done

145
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.230 
by means of a tuple the
username and password

146
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.450 
and the password that is secret
that is shared between

147
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:57.210 
the user and service. The passowrd
allows the service to recognize

148
00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.770 
the user behind his behind
her digital identity

149
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.500 
with the idea that only the user is
the one who knows the password

150
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:14.090 
that was saved in the
process of registration

151
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.130 
so the password is a
secret that is shared

152
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.700 
by the system and the
server and the user.

153
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:30.100 
The username password authentication
is easy to implement

154
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.150 
is very common but
it's rather unsafe

155
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:43.200 
why? It only checks that
someone knows something

156
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.460 
knows the password, everyone
who knows a password of a

157
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.700 
user can indentify him
herself as the one

158
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.710 
belonging to the digital
identity of that

159
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:02.590 
users the attacker can get the
password through various forms

160
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.140 
of attacks and then later on they
can misuse the users digital

161
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:12.620 
identity simply by

162
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.280 
identifying themself with the
user name of that person

163
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:24.380 
and the (corrupt?) password.
Here one speaks of an identity

164
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.300 
theft identity theft
that since the

165
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.490 
the attacker misuses the
digital identity of a user

166
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.110 
and the misuse can consist
in buying something

167
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.150 
in an online shop downloading
some video from

168
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.400 
a service or others and the
users of digital identity

169
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.490 
that's doings this in the
eyes of the service

170
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.660 
has to pay for it so there
are a number of attacks

171
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.940 
on passwords, passwords may be guessed
a password may be eavesdropped

172
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.810 
or cracked, there are social
engineering attacks dictionary

173
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.670 
attacks, men in the middle attacks
we will discuss later on

174
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.880 
several ones of this attacks but
what is important to remember

175
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.830 
this username password
authentication

176
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:26.310 
is very weak and unsafe, If
you look for more secure

177
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.580 
ways to authentication
to authenticate user

178
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.310 
in the online world in the internet
than a more secure authentication

179
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.500 
is achieved when the user
is connected to his

180
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.320 
digital identity we are for
example one time passwords

181
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.620 
this mechanism that a password
is only invented for one usage

182
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.630 
so and if the user has
used the password

183
00:14:55.210 --> 00:15:00.060 
then the password is no more
valid, even if an attacker has

184
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.390 
eavesdropped that
password and tries to

185
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.860 
authenticate by means
of this password

186
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:12.150 
that will more work. Other
stronger authentication

187
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.890 
methods are the usage of smart
cards of special smart cards

188
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.190 
the usage of electronics
certificates or others.

189
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.910 
Some more possibilities for
strong authentication

190
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:33.550 
is to also use some
physical characteristics

191
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:39.080 
to use some biometric features
for example fingerprint

192
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:46.520 
or language or iris or others.
In general we speak from

193
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.840 
strong authentication if there
are several factors used

194
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.180 
in the authentication process
the different factors may be

195
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.130 
knowledge the user know something
like in case of password

196
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.530 
there is a secret and the user
the real user knows the secret

197
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.640 
but we speak that several
factors have to be used

198
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.450 
the same time another factor could
be an ownership of something

199
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.420 
the user owns something for
example the user can present

200
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.400 
a smart card and this
is another proof

201
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.740 
that the user is the right
one that belongs to

202
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.270 
the digital identity. Finally
there is a group of physical

203
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:41.950 
features fingerprints, iris,
voice, or other things.

204
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.800 
We speak of a multi-factor
authentication

205
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:53.880 
when during the authenication
process at least two or even more

206
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.910 
different factors are checked so we
speak of a two or multi-factor

207
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:04.470 
authentication and here for example
in the case of the new identity

208
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:09.660 
card in Germany we have
first the ownership

209
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.210 
the person can present the
card the identity card we

210
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:19.210 
have a second factors that
is the biometric features

211
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:25.120 
so one sees a photo there is
a fingerprint stored and

212
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.270 
that card and finally
there is a third factor

213
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.320 
in knowledge that's a pin
because with this new identity

214
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.710 
card the user can also
identify can authenticate

215
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:45.920 
him or herself in the net in the internet
by means of this card and this pin.

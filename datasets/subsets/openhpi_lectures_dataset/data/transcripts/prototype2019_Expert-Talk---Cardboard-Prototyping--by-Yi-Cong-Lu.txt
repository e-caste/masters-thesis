Hi! I'm Cong. And I want to tell you
a bit about cardboard prototyping.

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.920 
First of all, a few words about
me. I'm trained as a product

3
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.430 
designer and right now I'm working
in the field of social design.

4
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.700 
What I mostly do in my job is
to help people to use their

5
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.020 
creativity and to work in teams.
As we have learned in this

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.560 
course, prototyping can help
you to manage the transition

7
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.880 
from thinking to making. And it
can help to bring alignment

8
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.400 
among the teams, especially if they
don't share the same vision.

9
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
In workshops, I like to help
people to design physical things

10
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.060 
and when they are not used to
express themselves visually,

11
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.190 
we start with getting familiar
with some materials,

12
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.600 
which should support them in their
three dimensional thinking.

13
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.510 
That means: materials that
allow you to literally draw

14
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.010 
or sketch into the space.
Cardboard is such a material,

15
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.100 
like a clay, wire or fabric.
And cardboard is great

16
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.540 
for all space and
object related ideas,

17
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.550 
and it's especially good to
substitute surfaces and objects,

18
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.730 
like this surface which has
edgy and round shapes,

19
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.350 
like wood, metal and plastic. So
you can cut, slice and fold it,

20
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.190 
you can easily build volumes with
it, as I said edgy and round

21
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.860 
shapes, and even if you don't
have a clear vision of what you

22
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.330 
want to build, you can just start
with the very first idea which

23
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.230 
comes to your mind. And if you get
into dialogue with your model

24
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.710 
that you start building, you will
get inspired for the next step.

25
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.670 
And with each little step you
build, like with each folding

26
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.490 
and slice you do, you will get a
clearer vision about the shapes

27
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.860 
and functionalities of your idea.
And when you get familiar

28
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.880 
with that method of building, you
can build really great things

29
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.040 
with it, as you can see on the
pictures. You can build entire

30
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.160 
spaces and interiors
into existing spaces

31
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.990 
and you can easily build props
for your testings to let people

32
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.150 
interact with your ideas
and experience them.

33
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.930 
As you can see on the pictures,
cardboard can also have a really

34
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.460 
high visual quality, that means
it can give your ideas strong

35
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.280 
physical presence or appearance
which makes it easy for people

36
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.120 
to imagine your idea, as if it
would be already existing.

37
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.360 
So as you can see, it's a great
material for really early prototyping

38
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.430 
of analog ideas. And I hope I
could inspire you to make your

39
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.820 
own experiment with it and to
support your design process.

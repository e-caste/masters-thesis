1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.320 
welcome to our the fourth week of
the open HPI course about internet

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.840 
security. In this week, we want
to discuss the consequences of

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.510 
the fact that the internet
is an open network,

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.650 
that the transport
routes are unsafe. The

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.440 
reason is, the Internet is
a network of networks.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.650 
And networks are provieded by
different partners that are

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.870 
interconnected by intermediate
systems. And so it is open.

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.760 
It is open, that means that
transport routes are accessible

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.260 
to everyone. And that the transport
routes are not protected.

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.650 
Everyone with access to the
Internet can use the Internet.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.690 
This is the reason for the big
success for the popularity

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.110 
of the internet. But it has a
lot of consequences when we

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
speak about security. Also
the internet technologies

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.400 
are publicly known. They
are mainly based on open,

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.600 
freely accessible standards. So
everyone who's interested about

16
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.090 
functionality of the
internet can get inside.

17
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.300 
It is the technic. So the internet
is not a private network.

18
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.590 
On its way from the sender
to the destination,

19
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.050 
to the receiver, the data packets
are transported through the

20
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.890 
different networks which
are on the route

21
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.130 
that the data packet
has to taking

22
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.520 
from the sender to
the destination.

23
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.440 
It's a different networks which
are passed by the data, are

24
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.640 
run by different authorities. so
here typically, the ways are

25
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
open, and this is, of course, a
very good situation for hackers.

26
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.230 
Because hackers, they can
see what's transported

27
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.540 
through the Internet. They can listen,
they can steal, they can even

28
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.900 
manipulate data
on its travel

29
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.570 
through the internet and
they can act under

30
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.850 
the false name. We will see what
kind of consequences this has.

31
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.890 
So what we want to or what
we have planned to do in

32
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.060 
this course week. We
start with the first

33
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.190 
repetition to see how the data are
transmitted on the internet,

34
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.160 
and which intermediate
systems are used

35
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.460 
and we discussed which dangers
lurk in the especially open

36
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.670 
wireless networks into
WiFis. Then, we intend

37
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.380 
to present the various dangers
and attack opportunities,

38
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
which are based on the
design of the Internet.

39
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.740 
So we are consider Eavesdropping.
Eavesdropping, that means

40
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.700 
that it's possible to listening
to the messages, to look

41
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.210 
to the data packets on their
open transport routes.

42
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.130 
Another danger, another
attack opportunity

43
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.170 
is spoofing. Spooling is to be
active with fake sender name.

44
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.160 
So in email, for example, with
the wrong sender address.

45
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.040 
A person that is familiar with another
person. Those are how the attackers

46
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.660 
to attack, to get access to
special data or to attack

47
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.600 
a website. And this spoofing attacks
are possible on very different

48
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.260 
levels in the internet.
Another type

49
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.220 
of attacks also called
me-in-the-middle attacks.

50
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.870 
Men in the middle attack
that means that even

51
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.410 
when two users connects,
created secure

52
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.910 
connection line between them,
even if, for the attackers

53
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.550 
it is possible to
place him or herself

54
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.610 
in the middle of these two users,
then he or she can listen

55
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.280 
to what they changed,
what kinds of change,

56
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.270 
and he or she can even
manipulate this data,

57
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.450 
which are confidential.
Another group of attacks

58
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.970 
consider services, services in
the internet. Services like the

59
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.170 
world wide web, like
email and others.

60
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.010 
They are very popular. So for
the attackers, it makes sense

61
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.240 
to attack gateways into server systems,
to break into service systems

62
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.260 
or do other things and to get
access to the data of the people,

63
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.850 
to be able to manipulate them,
to see what they are doing

64
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.670 
and others. Due to its huge
success and proliferation

65
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.200 
of world wide web, of course
as one of the most popular

66
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.480 
our attack targets on the
web. This attacks run

67
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.710 
against two sides, and this
attacks run against the user

68
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.500 
and misuses vulnerabilities
in browser,

69
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.980 
which allows attacks to the
target computers and devices

70
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.650 
of internet users. And on the
other side, attackers attack

71
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.770 
webservice of the provide, of the
service providers. They try

72
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.630 
to manipulate them,
and in such a way

73
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.500 
that this service themself
became attack towards.

74
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:53.510 
And then, in an excursion, we
will discuss so called APTs.

75
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.260 
Advanced Persistent Threats as
currently is the most advanced

76
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.060 
attack technology. One example
from such APTs are Stuxnet.

77
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.770 
And I am sure you have
heard about this,

78
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.620 
one of this APTs, by
which Iranian uranium

79
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.280 
centrifuges were attacked
and destroyed.

80
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.530 
This Stuxnet is a
typical example

81
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.870 
for such APT. And then, at the end
of this course week, we will

82
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.030 
discuss effective protective measures.
Protective measures against

83
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.560 
attacks, particularly on
the open transport routes

84
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.500 
in the internet. So i wish you
can find some new insights.

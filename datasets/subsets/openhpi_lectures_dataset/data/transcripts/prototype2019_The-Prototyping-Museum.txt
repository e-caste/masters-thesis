00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.850 
oh wait

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.710 
In this video, we want to take you
on a walk through our museum

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.330 
of prototypes. These are early
prototypes of products that became

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.700 
very successful, or companies
that are very well known.

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.970 
The original founders of McDonald's,
Richard and Maurice McDonald,

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.000 
developed a new system of
efficiently preparing and serving

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.490 
hamburgers and fries
in the 1940es.

8
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
In a scene of the movie 'The Founder',
the two brothers demonstrate

9
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.860 
how they built a space
prototype on a tennis court

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.720 
to test their system. They had
employees move through the space

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.810 
and act like they were
preparing burgers.

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.430 
We don't know if their process
testing looked exactly like this,

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.200 
but the movie offers a great
example of a space prototype.

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.320 
In the mid-90es, entrepreneur Jeff
Hawkins considered developing

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
a handheld computer, a
digital personal assistant.

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.720 
But he wasn't quite sure if people
would even use it, or what

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.040 
they would use it for. This is
why he built this simple paper

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.270 
prototype for the Palm Pilot.
Whenever he sat in a meeting

19
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
and felt he wanted to
take a digital note,

20
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.540 
or whenever he wanted to save a
date in his digital calendar,

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.790 
he would pull the prototype out
and use the chopstick pen as

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.020 
if he was noting something down.
This helped him to understand

23
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.700 
how often there was a demand
for taking digital notes.

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.060 
The first Palm Pilot
was released in 1996

25
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.700 
and became synonymous with
personal digital assistants.

26
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.070 
The founders of the Pulse news
app, Akshay Kothari and Ankit

27
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.150 
Gupta, took part in a Stanford
Design course at the end of their

28
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.180 
studies. They observed people reading
news in cafes in Palo Alto.

29
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.930 
In 2010, news had not
adapted to mobile yet:

30
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.140 
they were either painfully
slow to gather

31
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.780 
or overwhelming, for example in
the shape of news reader RSS

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.340 
feeds. Kothari and Gupta started to
develop different paper prototypes

33
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.290 
of a straightforward news app that
they showed the cafe goers.

34
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.630 
Paper helped them to quickly test
their main ideas and later

35
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.350 
they switched to keynote for
higher resolution prototypes,

36
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.090 
before they went to coding. The
Pulse app focused on six main

37
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.340 
features, only showed the current,
most important news, and used

38
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.100 
a lot of visuals. In 2013,
LinkedIn bought Pulse

39
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.350 
for 90 million dollars. Although
LinkedIn retired the independent

40
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.740 
Pulse App two years later, its
news feed architecture is still

41
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.890 
part of the LinkedIn
platform.

42
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.600 
The development of OXO Good Grips is a very
visual example of product prototyping.

43
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.320 
Founder Sam Ferber was inspired
by his wife Betsy who suffered

44
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.130 
from arthritis and struggled with
using kitchen peelers because

45
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.230 
they hurt her hands. After talking
to staff at various disability

46
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.860 
organizations, Ferber and his
co-founder Davin Stowell quickly

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.300 
went into prototyping, building
peelers of different sizes,

48
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.930 
different materials and
different dents for fingers.

49
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.250 
You can see that they prototyped
in parallel, developing many

50
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.090 
slightly different versions. OXO
Good Grips won several design

51
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.250 
awards and offers more than a thousand
household products nowadays.

52
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.370 
Zappos is an American online
shoe and clothing retailer

53
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.070 
which was bought by
Amazon in 2009 for

54
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.810 
1,2 billion dollars. In its
feeble beginnings ten years

55
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.280 
earlier, founder Nick Swinmurn
needed to test if users would

56
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.670 
actually be willing to
buy shoes online.

57
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.670 
He set up an elaborate
Wizard of Oz prototype:

58
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.980 
He went to the local shoe stores
and photographed the shoes

59
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.870 
on offer. Then he put those
shoes on the website -

60
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.290 
yes, this is what a website looked
like back in the early days -

61
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.490 
and whenever someone ordered them
he would buy them from his

62
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.210 
local store and send the
shoes to the customer.

63
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.280 
This wasn't an automated system yet,
as the website seemed to suggest,

64
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.290 
Swinmurn had to actually
do everything by hand.

65
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.640 
But he learned that users were
interested in buying shoes online,

66
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.970 
especially if they could
order different sizes.

67
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.990 
Many companies are currently
developing autonomous cars for

68
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.420 
everyday traffic, but during her
time at Stanford University,

69
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.420 
researcher Wendy Ju was mainly
interested in the interaction

70
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.830 
between autonomous vehicles
and pedestrians.

71
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.620 
By hiding a driver in a car seat
costume, her research team

72
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.030 
was able to check how
pedestrians would react

73
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.560 
to the first autonomous
cars on the streets.

74
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.410 
Maybe some of them would need
visual cues to better interact

75
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.790 
with driverless vehicles? There
are many more prominent examples

76
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.130 
for prototypes out there, be it IBM'
early speech-to-text prototype

77
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.270 
(which actually had secretaries
typing down the words they heard,

78
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.450 
instead of an actual computer),
James Dyson's 5000 prototypes

79
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.980 
before finalizing the
Dyson vacuum cleaner,

80
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.720 
Google Glasses, or the minimum
viable product explainer video

81
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.930 
by Dropbox CEO Drew Houston. We
hope the examples from our little

82
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:59.970 
museum walk can inspire your
own prototyping journey.

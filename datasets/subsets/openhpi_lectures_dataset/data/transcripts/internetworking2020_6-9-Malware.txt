00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.830 
In our OpenHPI course, a
half-century of internet,

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.920 
we want to discuss
Malware,

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.480 
malicious software. The word
is formed from Mal from

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.850 
Malicious and Ware
from Software.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.310 
This is a term  which

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.860 
shows that software has
some bad intention,

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.180 
for example, viruses and worms
are malicious software.

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.900 
Trojan horse, adware, spyware,
ransomware, there is a number

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.740 
of different types of such
malicious software which aims

10
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.710 
to do something bad. So modern
malware even worse, often cannot

11
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.390 
be characterized by just one type
of malware, it is a combination

12
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.730 
of different functionalities of
different types of malware.

13
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.980 
Often one can configure them and add
functionality can be loaded dynamically.

14
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
So with malware, it is very important and is a
serious discussion about internet security.

15
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.170 
So let's go a little bit through
the different types of malware.

16
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.900 
Let's start with viruses, these
are harmful for small programs

17
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.540 
that integrate themselves into
an installed application

18
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.870 
i.e. the host program and then after
being integrated in this host program,

19
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.950 
it works to do
something wrong,

20
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.920 
and often it is designed in such
a way that it's not easy to

21
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.770 
see whether the virus has integrated
into such a host program or not.

22
00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.360 
So typically, it falsifies or
modifies the host program and

23
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.430 
leads to different
malfunctions.

24
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.120 
The performance is affected and the
functionality of the infected systems

25
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.820 
is no more the right one. And
it replicates and this is

26
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.450 
where the name virus comes from,
it replicates itself locally

27
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.940 
using the host program. So the
replication has a particular

28
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.160 
effect on the performance of the infected
system, this is where it's possible

29
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.870 
to sometimes detect that there
is such a virus in place.

30
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.260 
Another malicious software
another malware are worms,

31
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.720 
worms are malicious applications that
spread automatically after execution

32
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.720 
via a network or a removable media,
for example, in USB sticks.

33
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.590 
Worms are able to self execute
after spreading, the

34
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.660 
user does not have to explicitly
confirm yes I agree that it's

35
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.760 
executed, so it's done automatically
and often such worms spread faster

36
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.450 
than viruses.

37
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.410 
Worms work standalone, so it's
typically more complex and viruses

38
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.900 
do not change any external
files, so malicious code

39
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.520 
for example, reduction of performance,
a subsequent installation of other

40
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.120 
malware, opening backdoors, this is
providing the attackers to get access

41
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.560 
to the system of the victim, the
worms can prepare this and the

42
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.180 
infected computer may be used
also as a bot in a botnet.

43
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.400 
Another type of malware,
Trojan horses,

44
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.960 
these are computer applications that
disguise themselves as useful application,

45
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.730 
but they have a hidden
malicious functionality,

46
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.730 
so when the allegedly harmless
application is launched,

47
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.870 
the malicious function is automatically executed,
for example, registration pages showing

48
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.680 
that looks likes a real
registration page of the service,

49
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.800 
the user gives in user name and
password, and then instead

50
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.630 
the data are sent
to the attacker.

51
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.760 


52
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.650 
So Trojan horses can also
disguise themselves

53
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.410 
as documents or as files and the
malicious function is executed

54
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.340 
when the document or when
the file is opened,

55
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:19.640 
so all this malware is really
dangerous as like the keylogger.

56
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.210 
Keyloggers are many programs
that exactly recall

57
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.240 
all the user's keystrokes and
the more powerful variants

58
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.810 
also capture the content
of the screen,

59
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.910 
and the idea behind this is as if the
screen shows a registration page

60
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.390 
then the keylogger exactly
captures what the user is doing,

61
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.140 
and in this way, the
keylogger gets a password

62
00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:03.360 
from the user which then
is stored on the data.

63
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.210 
If you know the data file, it's
accessible by the attacker or

64
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.250 
is directly sent
to the attacker.

65
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.970 
So the recorded user inputs are
stored in a file accessible and

66
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.420 
to the attacker and they may
use this information for

67
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.800 
identity theft, for bank
transfers, and for other things.

68
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.830 
There are more types of
malware, theAdware,

69
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.110 
it is a software that displays
advertising in addition

70
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.950 
to the actual
functionality,

71
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.780 
it sounds not so worse but
Adware can also be integrated

72
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:52.460 
into the web browser when it makes it possible
to display advertisements on every website.

73
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.790 
So malicious software that uses such
advertising is for example browser plug-ins

74
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.630 
that embed javascript with ads
on each page, it's a borrowing

75
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:11.670 
if one uses it and also often other
malware they could include.

76
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.600 
Spyware is a malware, is a software
that sends sensitive data

77
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.500 
to third parties without
the consent of the owner,

78
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.210 
manufacturer or web service
provider of a government agency,

79
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.280 
or foreign intelligence service.
So all the information

80
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.200 
that are sent to the with or without
their knowledge or sent to the attacker

81
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:49.390 
spyware is also referred to as spy software,
snooping software, spy programs.

82
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:57.550 
The data transmission, of course, takes
place in secret otherwise one could detect

83
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:04.500 
that there is such a malware in
place and often it's used,

84
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.930 
also this is of interest
for the attacker,

85
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.870 
but also such Spywares also used
for information retrieval

86
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:25.330 
of personal data, for example, passwords,
credit card data and others.

87
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.620 
From headlines in the newspapers,
you know Ransomware,

88
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.280 
ransomware this is another
malicious software program

89
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.210 
that prevents the user from accessing
his data and extort money.

90
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:50.770 
So infection is carried out by an
email attachment via Trojans,

91
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.140 
and then all the data

92
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.210 
on the hard drive
are encrypted

93
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:03.130 
in such a way that the
victim the owner can

94
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.350 
no longer view and use
his or her own data.

95
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.320 
Data are only encrypted and it's impossible
to decrypt and then the attacker

96
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:20.330 
they offer decryption
of the data

97
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.830 
at a cost of course,

98
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.740 
The problem whether one should pay
or whether one should not pay

99
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:35.570 
the German Cybersecurity Administration,
BSI advises not to pay

100
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.850 
since often further requests follow, pay
more or the data are not decrypted

101
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:50.600 
despite payment. Here one needs to
take other protective measures,

102
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.600 
regular backup, if data
are regularly backed up

103
00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.200 
then it's not a problem
if they are encrypted

104
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.270 
because then one can go back to the
version of the last backup to the data

105
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.690 
and if it's done on a regular basis
then one does not lose so much money.

106
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:21.400 
The awesome famous examples
of a malware attacks

107
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:30.160 
is the ILOVEYOU attack became very
popular and often discussed.

108
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.500 
Here the idea was a malicious software
that was launched from the Philippines

109
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.710 
in 2000and then it was sent
as an e-mail with its

110
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:46.570 
subject ILOVEYOU and then
there was an attachment

111
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.450 
and the attachment was
love letter for you,

112
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.640 
And what you see typically, it
would be only a text it would

113
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.650 
have to stop here,
but it was a script

114
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.720 
so this extension a vbs,
visual basic script

115
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.690 
was not displayed on windows
systems so the people could

116
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.320 
not see that it is a script,
they were thinking it's a text

117
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.960 
and then they
opened the text.

118
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.710 
They were keen to see
who loves them,

119
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:27.700 
and at the moment they opened the
attachment then see, the script

120
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.710 
was performed and the worm
sent itself to all contacts

121
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.810 
in the windows
address books,

122
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:44.900 
and overwrote the
image files

123
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.530 
and they misused
these contacts as

124
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:55.840 
the warm sends emails and the
people trust this email

125
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.680 
because it came from an own contact,
it was a contact from the

126
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.430 
the infected system and the email, of
course, had an attendant letter,

127
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.930 
had the subject I love you and had
a love letter, and then also

128
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.980 
more system got
affected.

129
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:25.750 
So there was an estimation of
the damage between 5 and 9

130
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.550 
Billion US dollars, a huge amount, of
ten per cent of all internet users

131
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:37.220 
were affected by this I love you
worm and in the first days

132
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.790 
50 million infections
were reported.

133
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.950 
Ofcourse after a while because
everyone get in touch meant it was

134
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.780 
reported in the newspaper and
people started to become

135
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:58.190 
more careful, but in the first days
it infected fifty million systems.

136
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.780 
Another example of a
Malware is Stuxnet,

137
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.300 
we already mentioned it when
we spoke about APT attacks,

138
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:14.980 
the advanced persistent
text stagnates,

139
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.340 
is a worm, it was
introduced in 2007

140
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.210 
but discovered in 2010.

141
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:30.500 
And this worm made use of various
previously unknown vulnerabilities

142
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:37.130 
of so-called zero-day
vulnerabilities in windows systems

143
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.750 
and in networks.

144
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.780 
Once connected to the system
via a removable media

145
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.420 


146
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.890 
after the first
steps with this

147
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:56.430 
infection via this USB stick the
connection to the system only occasional

148
00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.110 
occasional internet access
was required for feedback.

149
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:09.270 
The worm searches on the system, the infected
system for SCADA control software.

150
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.600 
This is for industrial systems,
here in that case it was

151
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:20.340 
SCADA software from Siemens and
the software was in place

152
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.200 
to control the technical processes
in waterworks in pipelines,

153
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:33.340 
factories, nuclear power plants, and here
it was used to attack the nuclear power

154
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.270 
installations.

155
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.100 
So the idea of civil war, the
goal of the war was to

156
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.410 
change various settings of
this control software

157
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.800 
and then Stuxnet led
to the destruction

158
00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:01.910 
of this Iranian nuclear
power plants,

159
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.740 


160
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:13.370 
and the result was that see that
Iran's illegal nuclear program

161
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.910 
was delayed.

162
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:25.500 
A recent example is Emotet,
the emotet attack

163
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.670 
it is a banking trojan horse
which was first discovered in

164
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.140 
2014,

165
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.500 
it initially was developed
as banking malware

166
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.280 
to steal confidential data from
other people's computer,

167
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.940 
as the new versions of Emotet have
been enhanced with additional

168
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:53.100 
malicious functionality, for example,
spamming functions and others

169
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.750 
Emotets spreading through
well-done spam emails

170
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.990 
if the infection is successful,
it takes over the contact list

171
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:14.150 
and then it sends itself new messages
to the people from that contact list.

172
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:20.590 
Studies in last
August 2020 was

173
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.800 
known attacks between February
2020 and July 2020.

174
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:31.350 
But since July 2020 the number of
attacks has increased again,

175
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:39.870 
so you see sometimes this malware is
in place and then from time to time

176
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.300 
the attacker reused it for
a new wave of attacks.

177
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.330 
What are the protective
measures against

178
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:53.710 
Emotet attacks? Every time
install updates for operating

179
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:59.270 
system and applications promptly
because the windows analyze

180
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:06.180 
analyzes how it infiltrates into
the system and try to close

181
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:14.360 
the entrance doors and with a new
update then this comes also

182
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.490 
to the customers. You should use
regularly updated anti-virus software

183
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.600 
because as with the attacks the
anti-virus software vendors

184
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.510 
by signatures of the
recent attacks

185
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.930 
create regulary backups so that
even if system is affected

186
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:47.000 
you have access to your data. And
then careful examination of

187
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:54.570 
any message one is receiving, do not
open the attachment, be careful

188
00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:01.270 
even if the sender seems to be
known. If you are in doubt, please

189
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:07.520 
contact the sender by telephone, so
that you do not open a malicious

190
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.990 


191
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.640 


192
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.900 
software system by opening
such an attachment

193
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.290 
which leads to the installation
of malware on your computer.

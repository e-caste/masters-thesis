00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.549 
Hello, everybody. First of all, let me congratulate you for

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.049 
working through the course of future of computing IBM Power

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.669 
9 and beyond, and at the same time, let me thank Andreas

4
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.829 
for this great opportunity to introduce the IBM power architecture

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.658 
in the light of enterprise computing using the openHPI MOOC

6
00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.340 
platform for the very first time.

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.499 
In the course of the past weeks, you've got detailed insights into

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.329 
the challenges of today's IT infrastructure and hopefully

9
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.549 
you also got the right pointers to face these challenges by means of picking

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.779 
a workable architecture which is capable to deal with them.

11
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.420 
The course took you through the complete system stack.

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.219 
Starting with the implementation of the micro architecture in

13
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.279 
the processor and the applications of physics of semiconductors

14
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.659 
in regard to Moore's Law.

15
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.139 
Moving forward to the notes on the various operating systems and

16
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.599 
their exploitation of advanced features like parallization respectively,

17
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.250 
hardware acceleration.

18
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.059 
Continuing into cloud computing, which is one

19
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.499 
of the game changers in today's IT business and which is asking for

20
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.999 
advanced concepts of virtualization, as well as raising

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.800 
new questions in regard to security and availability.

22
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.859 
And last but not least, some reflections on the ramifications

23
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.479 
of new workloads like block chain or a in the real

24
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.561 
world scenarios represented by customer cases.

25
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.669 
While this course made you well familiar with the state of the art technology

26
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.288 
of today, the journey of innovation is never

27
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.759 
ending. In the research and development labs, scientists

28
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.469 
were constantly on characteristics and implementations

29
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.150 
of future compute machines.

30
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.319 
As a major critical step for the well familiar for architectures,

31
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.719 
the adoption of CMOS technology based on so-called extreme ultraviolet

32
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.240 
lithography is approaching soon.

33
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.149 
EUVs will push the ending of Moore's Law a little bit further into the

34
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.429 
future as it allows for an even higher density of transistors

35
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.430 
for Scrouge.

36
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.609 
The IBM power architecture is well underway in this endeavor, and the

37
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.289 
next generation of systems will leverage the advantages of such

38
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.290 
technology.

39
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.179 
At the same time, there are completely new computer approaches on

40
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.929 
the horizon. These architectures have the potential

41
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.789 
to augment today's implementations of computing machines and focus

42
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.949 
on specific applications as they are brought in by artificial intelligence

43
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.629 
and analytics issues in the context of big data.

44
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.919 
Neuromorphic computing, respectively, quantum computing are prominent

45
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.359 
representatives of such approaches which embrace

46
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.129 
and analog compute paradigms as they had been considered in the early days

47
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.599 
of automated computing, or introduce completely new

48
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.309 
widgets like so-called Qubits, which operate on base of quantum

49
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.310 
theory.

50
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.689 
The task at hand is to find the best solution, how these various approaches can be

51
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.149 
combined and integrated in the best manner to solve the problems

52
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.489 
of tomorrow and beyond.

53
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.969 
With this, thanks again for joining this course and

54
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.919 
stay tuned for the future.

55
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920 
Bye bye.

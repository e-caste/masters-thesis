00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.030 
Welcome to this video in which we
want to discuss a scientific

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.270 
article with you.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.480 
Have you read the paper "The
Promise of Entrepreneurship as

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.590 
a Field of Research" yet written
by Scott Shane and Sankaran

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.550 
Venkataraman and published in 2000
in the Academy of Management Review?

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.310 
If not, feel free to stop watching this
video now and go read this article first.

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.300 
We provided a link to access the article
in the previous course section.

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.840 
Great! You have read one of the
most important and most debated

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.500 
articles in the domain
of entrepreneurship.

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.550 
We hope you found the read
insightful and made it into the

11
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.240 
end of this rather
theoretical piece.

12
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.540 
Let's jump into the
discussion of the article.

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.760 
First, we will take a look at
the journal and the publisher.

14
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.150 
After that, we will take a look
at the two authors and at the

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.790 
topics they respectively
focus the research on.

16
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.100 
Then, we will briefly summarize
the article's main points.

17
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.490 
After that we will shortly analyze
how this article was adopted

18
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.560 
by other scientists, before we conclude with
a critical assessment of the article.

19
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.320 
The article was published in
the Academy of Management Review,

20
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
in short AMR. AMR is a quarterly scientific
journal in management research.

21
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.960 
It is published by the Academy of
Management and is considered

22
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.480 
one of the most prestigious journal
in its field. Many official

23
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.970 
journal rankings, including the
Jourqual give the journal the

24
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.280 
respective highest
quality rating.

25
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.370 
Another quality indicator that we
can use is the impact factor.

26
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.960 
We mentioned how the impact factor
is calculated in the previous

27
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.670 
paper talk also with Nina. You
surely remember it. The higher the

28
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.220 
impact factor, the more
highly ranked the journal.

29
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.860 
With an impact factor above eight
respectively above twelve,

30
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.070 
for the five years, AMR has an
extremely high impact and can

31
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.950 
be considered among the top one or
two percent in its field. Right, Nina?

32
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.900 
Right. In other words, articles that appear in
this channel are usually worthwhile reading.

33
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.570 
However, it is not just about rankings and impact
in management and entrepreneurship research.

34
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.910 
Obviously there are other criteria
that make for a good journal,

35
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.530 
but that's a discussion
for another day.

36
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.590 
Let's go on and take a look at
the two authors. Scott Shane

37
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.720 
is a professor of entrepreneurial
studies at Weatherhead School

38
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
of Management in the US. He has
published a multitude of scholarly

39
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.290 
articles and several books on
entrepreneurship and innovation management.

40
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.660 
Many articles were published in
leading scientific journals,

41
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.220 
not only in AMR, like the article
that you've read, but also

42
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.330 
in management science or organization
science, for example. His

43
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.530 
research focuses on
technology entrepreneurship,

44
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.160 
new firm formation, economic
development and new venture finance.

45
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.050 
The second author Sankaran Venkataraman
is a professor of

46
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.110 
business administration and the senior
associate dean at the University of Virginia.

47
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.940 
He too is an internationally
known scholar and educator

48
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.040 
in the field of entrepreneurship with a
focus on entrepreneurial opportunities,

49
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.470 
strategy, new venture creation
and entrepreneurship education.

50
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.060 
Other articles of him appeared, for example,
in the Journal of Business Venturing

51
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.950 
or in Entrepreneurship
Theory and practice.

52
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.040 
Now that we know a bit about the context
of the article and the authors,

53
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.840 
let's look at the
article's main points.

54
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.680 
First, why write an article about
entrepreneurship as a field of research

55
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.300 
and what do they describe as their
motivation in the first section?

56
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.970 
They state that other researchers,
for example from the field

57
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.900 
of strategy or management, doubt
whether entrepreneurship is

58
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.760 
necessary as a field of research and
what this field can contribute.

59
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.350 
What makes researching entrepreneurship
unique and isn't that

60
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.300 
just one aspect of
research on new firms?

61
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.500 
I think that this is a very good
question to ask. What do you

62
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.020 
think, Valeska? I think, in
order to prove the usefulness

63
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.420 
of entrepreneurship as a unique
domain, the authors intend to

64
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.240 
provide a conceptual framework
that enables to explain and

65
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.770 
predict empirical phenomena that
cannot be explained by conceptual

66
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.410 
frameworks from
other domains.

67
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.310 
Based on this framework, they intend
to demonstrate three aspects.

68
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.300 
First, a new definition of
entrepreneurship and the relationships

69
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.860 
among the factors that
compose entrepreneurship.

70
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.190 
Second, an explanation why researchers
should study entrepreneurship.

71
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.050 
And third, a description of existence, discovery and
exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities.

72
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.280 
So, let's summarize what they wrote for
the first aspect, a new definition.

73
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.310 
They criticized that previous
definitions have defined a field

74
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.270 
solely in terms of who the entrepreneur
is and what he or she does.

75
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.260 
In contrast to previous research,
the authors emphasize now

76
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.010 
that entrepreneurship involves
true phenomena. Not only the

77
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.430 
presence of the individual, but also the
presence of lucrative opportunities.

78
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.010 
So Nina, this is where this concept
of opportunities comes into play right?

79
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.110 
Probably you remember the video
in the session on the ABCs

80
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.040 
of entrepreneur mindsets, right? We
discussed the behaviors of entrepreneurs

81
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.510 
how they act. We concluded that
entrepreneurial behavior is

82
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.340 
the observable human behavior
involved in finding and exploiting

83
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.300 
entrepreneurial opportunities through
creating and developing new ventures.

84
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.900 
So yes, the concept of opportunities plays
an important role in entrepreneurship.

85
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.730 
Exactly. So back to our paper. The
authors go on by defining

86
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:23.030 
the field of entrepreneurship as the
scholarly examination of how, by whom

87
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.370 
and with what effects opportunities
are discovered, evaluated and

88
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.340 
exploited. Consequently, the authors
argue that entrepreneurship as

89
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.650 
a research field involves the study of three
aspects that are central to opportunities:

90
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:46.050 
first, the discovery, second, the evaluation, and
third, the exploitation of opportunities.

91
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.540 
And of course, the study of the
individuals who discover, evaluate,

92
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.670 
and exploit these
opportunities.

93
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.830 
First, with regard to existence,
they argue that entrepreneurial

94
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.470 
opportunities exist when there is
a situation in which new goods,

95
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.870 
services, raw materials and organizing
methods can be introduced

96
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.760 
and sold at a greater price than
the cost of their production.

97
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:19.390 
Second, with regard to discovery, they argue that
when an entrepreneurial opportunity exists,

98
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.730 
an individual has to recognize
that this opportunity exists

99
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.270 
and that it has a value. They
state that the reason why

100
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.220 
some people and not others discover
entrepreneurial opportunities

101
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:38.230 
has to do with the possession of prior
information and cognitive properties

102
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.530 
such as the ability to identify commercial
opportunities for an invention.

103
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.100 
And then third, with regard to
exploitation, the authors emphasize

104
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.350 
that when an entrepreneur opportunity
exists and when an individual

105
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:58.760 
has discovered this opportunity, this
person has to decide to exploit it.

106
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.740 
The decision whether
to exploit it

107
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.560 
is influenced by
characteristics of both:

108
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.740 
the opportunity and
the individual.

109
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.530 
He or she might ask what is the
expected value of the opportunity

110
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.020 
and is this expected value higher
than the cost to exploit it?

111
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.260 
The authors conclude that entrepreneurship
is an important and relevant field

112
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.510 
and should be considered a
unique conceptual domain.

113
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.050 
But as you know, the article was
published in two thousand, more

114
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.490 
than twenty years ago.

115
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.350 
However, it is still a
highly relevant article.

116
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.210 
Looking at other articles
that have cited it,

117
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.580 
we can even see an increase
of total citations per year.

118
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.470 
Within the last twenty years, the authors
propositions have been intensely debated

119
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.110 
mainly in the fields of

120
00:08:54.710 --> 00:09:00.160 
business management and economics.
After this article was published,

121
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.790 
researchers paid considerable attention
to entrepreneurial opportunities.

122
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.110 
Many of the topics that were
mentioned have been advanced. For

123
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.720 
example, the question on how
entrepreneurial processes evolve and

124
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.790 
the examination of prior knowledge
and other drivers for the

125
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.530 
discovery of entrepreneurial
opportunities.

126
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.350 
Yes, only recently in 2020 at
the Academy of Management Perspectives,

127
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.450 
two distinguished entrepreneurship
researchers Mike Wright and Philip Phan,

128
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.990 
even went so far to call the
discussion the "opportunity wars".

129
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.500 
Two of the still hotly debated questions
around the opportunity concept are whether

130
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.360 
opportunities are either discovered
or created and whether

131
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.270 
the opportunity construct
is useful at all.

132
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.100 
Of course, just like any other
scientific article, this article,

133
00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:01.680 
too, has its limitations. These relate to, for
example, the conclusiveness of the framework:

134
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.420 
are there only three aspects existence,
discovery and exploitation,

135
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:11.990 
or shouldn't there be more aspects, such
as opportunity outcomes, for example?

136
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.010 
Another point of criticism would be
whether such a strict separation

137
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.090 
from other fields is even necessary.
Possibly, an integration

138
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.440 
of strategy and entrepreneurship could
yield in relevant research outcomes, too.

139
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.040 
However, without any doubt, the
article has served to spark the

140
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.990 
discussion on entrepreneurship as a
discipline and has contributed to sharpen

141
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.590 
the distinctiveness of
our research field.

142
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.140 
That was it for this paper
discussion. We hope that you made

143
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.770 
a valuable experience as a researcher
yourself, reading this article.

144
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.410 
And, of course, we hope it
contributed to your understanding

145
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.230 
of entrepreneurship as a
scientific discipline.

146
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.280 
See you in the next
video. Bye!

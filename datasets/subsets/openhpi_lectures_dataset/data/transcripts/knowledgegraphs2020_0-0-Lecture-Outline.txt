00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780 
Welcome to Knowledge Graphs. I am
Harald Sack and I am Mehwish

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.050 
Alam, and we both are from FIZ
Karlsruhe and KIT Karlsruhe .

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.030 
So, what will the lecture be about?
We will talk about Knowledge

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.420 
Graphs, a rather popular and
important topic right now.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.860 
What are Knowledge Graphs?
Here is a small example of

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.550 
of Neil Armstrong, you might
remember this is the first man

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.800 
of the moon and of course, Neil
Armstrong is more than just the

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.900 
character string that
defines his name.

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.780 
What does it take to understand who is
Neil Armstrong? So how do we gather

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.160 
the meaning for that, for example,
you have to know that the

11
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
guy was an Astronaut and a test
pilot, and both Astronauts and

12
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.080 
Test pilots usually are persons.
You might know the birth date

13
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.070 
and potentially also the death
date of Neil Armstrong. And most

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.350 
importantly you might know that he was
one of the crew members of Apollo 11,

15
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.920 
a space mission the first one
that reached the moon and that

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.680 
also carried the other crew members
Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.040 
So this is information that
can be as you see here,

18
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.080 
represented in terms of a graph and
exactly based on that technology we

19
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.600 
will give you an
introduction.

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.900 
Based on knowledge graphs
sophisticated innovation

21
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.680 
systems can be implemented and we
will talk about that in the course

22
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.480 
of the lecture. However, all of
the technology here is based

23
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.810 
on the so-called Semantic Web
Technology stick that we will

24
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350 
treat in detail in the
course of this lecture.

25
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.820 
Now we come to a short outline, what do
you have to expect in the lecture.

26
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.930 
In the very first lecture, we talk
about knowledge graphs in the web

27
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.370 
of data. So first, we make the
distinction between data information

28
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.310 
and knowledge because this is
rather important to keep in mind,

29
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.740 
and then we are going to ask the question,
"how do we represent knowledge?"

30
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.560 
For knowledge, of course, the
process of gathering knowledge

31
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.660 
is rather important and therefore
also the process of understanding.

32
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.010 
So we will talk about what
does it take to understand

33
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.940 
and after that, we are prepared
to go towards the universal

34
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.380 
knowledge representation and we
will talk about the semantic web

35
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.260 
linked data and
the web of data.

36
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.700 
And then in the next lecture, we
will introduce the basic semantic

37
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.540 
technologies where we are going to see
how to identify and access things.

38
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.260 
After that, we will see how to represent
simple facts with the help of RDF

39
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.830 
which will then continue to more details on
RDF such as RDF total serialization,

40
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.440 
RDF complex data structures and model
building with the help of RDF schema.

41
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.220 
And finally, we will have a look at the
logical inference with RDF schema

42
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.850 
and then you will have
our first excursion in

43
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.360 
RDF aid that is
RDF and the web.

44
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.050 
In lecture number 3, we are going
deeper into a query language for RDF,

45
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.850 
RDF can be stored in files or
even huge databases and there

46
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.300 
is a query language called SPARQL
and first we ask of course

47
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.830 
how to query RDF and RDFS and since
we need some kind of knowledge

48
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.930 
bases and knowledge graphs we are going
to ask a query our SPARQL queries,

49
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.340 
we will introduce in two excursions,
first Wikipredia as a general

50
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.050 
knowledge graph and then also Wiki data
as a general open knowledge graph.

51
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.880 
We will use these two knowledge
graphs for all subsequent queries

52
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.380 
that you will see during the
lecture and then you will learn

53
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.400 
how to phrase more complex queries
even more complex queries

54
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.950 
with SPARQL, SPARQL sub-queries,
property pass and so on before

55
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.340 
I give you a brief overview of
the design principles of RDF

56
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.730 
databases so-called triple stores.
and At the end of that lecture

57
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.090 
we will learn that SPARQL is indeed
more than a query language.

58
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.610 
We are then going towards knowledge
representation with ontologies,

59
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.460 
where we are going to start with
a brief history of ontologies

60
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.980 
and then we are going to answer the
questions of why we do need Not logic.

61
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.120 
And then in excursion 4 and
5, we will give an overview

62
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.440 
of the essential logics and
the description logics

63
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.760 
and then we move towards the
first steps in the web ontology

64
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.260 
language that is OWL and
then we discuss a bit more

65
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.190 
about OWL and then we go
beyond. And finally you

66
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.180 
will learn how to design
your own Ontology.

67
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.930 
Ok now it's time that we are
talking about applications, as

68
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.160 
soon as we know about the
technology behind knowledge

69
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.220 
graphs, how they can be
applied, first we will talk

70
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.620 
about ontologies in action, which
means we will give you a brief

71
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.090 
overview or deeper view exactly on
what type of ontologies are there,

72
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.690 
and what kind of pitfalls you
should avoid to run into.

73
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.770 
Then we continue with knowledge
graphs and of course a first

74
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.730 
formal definition of what is a knowledge
graph before we are going into detail

75
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.040 
with RDF and OWL-based knowledge
graphs. And then of course

76
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.490 
you want to use that kind of
knowledge technology within your

77
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.400 
application development, this means we are going
to talk about knowledge graph programming,

78
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.490 
then we want to visualize the data
that comes out of the knowledge

79
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.550 
graph, and then we are also going
to show you how to do knowledge

80
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.680 
graph analytics, that means how to
generate new knowledge that is available

81
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.720 
in the data that can be found
within knowledge graphs.

82
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.960 
In lecture 6, we are going to
talk about advanced knowledge

83
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.560 
graph applications where we will
start with explaining the

84
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.990 
graph in the knowledge graphs and
then we are going to define

85
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.640 
an approximation on the large
knowledge graphs by knowledge

86
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.840 
graph embeddings, which can then be
used for knowledge graph completion.

87
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.040 
And then for dealing with more
than one knowledge graphs

88
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.890 
in order to define the mappings,
we will look into knowledge

89
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.800 
graph mappings and alignment and
then we move towards the semantic

90
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.190 
search and exploratory search
with documentary systems.

91
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.950 
And then we also have a brief
bibliography for you, so if you

92
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.400 
are interested to go deeper and
deepen your knowledge on semantic

93
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.680 
technologies which is the basis
for knowledge graphs, these

94
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.000 
are two books one on semantic web
and the other one on linked data

95
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.430 
that you might read besides the
course, because within the course

96
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.460 
we will always give you references
and links to online documents

97
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.500 
that you can read and further
deepen and also consolidate

98
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.340 
your knowledge about
knowledge graphs.

99
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.890 
So far so good, that's it now
let's start with the lecture.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.790 
The web today and tomorrow, let's speak about social web semantic and the service web.

2
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.170 
The web was designed in nineteen ninety and the evolution of the world

3
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.740 
wide web in this last twenty five years shape today's web

4
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.280 
through numerous transformation. So originally

5
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.630 
web was read-only web or static web. All the resources

6
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.610 
were static HTML pages and by means of HTTP protocol the user

7
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.180 
requested and received this document.

8
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.390 
Often this phase of the world wide web is named web 1.0.

9
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.500 
Only a few experts also were able to publish content

10
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.250 
to understand the HTML, to design such HTML pages, to set up a

11
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.050 
web server to place this resources on the web server and to

12
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.810 
make it a weight over the world wide web.

13
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
And the resources that were offered over the world wide web

14
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.990 
were mostly static. And then

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.610 
around two thousand it started to change the character of the world wide web,

16
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.340 
to change into participation web.

17
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.460 
This development we can see up to now, some people

18
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.400 
call this web 2.0,

19
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.300 
read-write web. In that phase users became able for example by mean of

20
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.660 
the ajax technology we discussed already to publish own content

21
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.680 
in a very simple way. So it was not more necessary to be IT

22
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
specialist everyone could publish content

23
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.870 
mainly through the social web

24
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.870 
applications, so an important characteristic or the important

25
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.310 
character of the web 2.0 is what's also called social web.

26
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.180 
In the time although dynamic websites websites become more and more common

27
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.160 
so by means of the web programming on client side on server side the

28
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.120 
web pages were designed

29
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.750 
designed dynamically exactly

30
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.440 
according to the wishes and

31
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.810 
parameters given by the user.

32
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.920 
On the same side webpages become more and more complex,

33
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.360 
new technologies allowed the developer to build future rich web-based applications.

34
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.150 
This is the web as you know it from today.

35
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.100 
But then the next step next phase in development

36
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.500 
of the web is sometimes also called web 3.0 serves the semantic

37
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.000 
and the service web or the semantic and the execution web.

38
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.250 
This is an development still emerging and here its characteristic

39
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.560 
that the information becomes machine readable

40
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.350 
and understandable.See former phases the web was designed for

41
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.420 
humans and humans where the user and interact by the web the information was designed

42
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.930 
in a way that it's understandable readable by humans.

43
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.310 
But more and more one has detected that the web can also be used

44
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.290 
for machine to machine communication, and that machine to machine

45
00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.070 
communication becomes important if one creates more complex web applications.

46
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.590 
For example to produce a dynamic output, a dynamic dynamic webpage,

47
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.640 
by means of several web applications placed on different servers in the

48
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
in the world that interact, that have to interact to each other to

49
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.350 
produce this page the user wants to see.

50
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.380 
This is the executing web or the service web if we speak about semantic web.

51
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.050 
Today's situation is that search genes are keyboard based

52
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.640 
and a search machine looks exactly for the string of characters and then

53
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.850 
all the information all the resources available in the web where this

54
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.420 
string of characters plays an important role are

55
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.680 
shown to the to the user.

56
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.010 
But such search machines from today they don't understand the meaning

57
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.950 
of this string of characters they don't understand the meaning

58
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.070 
of the search term and documents so what we expect in the future is

59
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.750 
that and this is an expectation to the so called semantic web

60
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.460 
is that it's not only longer, is only the string of characters

61
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.740 
that is a machine as the web is understanding but the web has some means

62
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.880 
to understand the meaning of this

63
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.560 
string of characters.

64
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.460 
So the semantic web no longer consists of

65
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.270 
stupid documents but of things, of people, of places, of events and

66
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.630 
their relations to each other.

67
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.190 
And the other important

68
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.930 
part or characteristic of this web 3.0 phases are

69
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.490 
the service web or web services many web applications become interconnected

70
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.290 
through the web service technology we will discuss

71
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.690 
as well as semantic web in this week.

72
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.630 
But that is not an end of the development,

73
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.620 
there's a next transformation starting today,

74
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.100 
and this is a mobile web some people call this web 4.0.

75
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.880 
Here parallel alternative versions of the existing web

76
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.120 
occur and are accessible over smartphones,

77
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.860 
so the documents and the resources in the web are designed

78
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.430 
also to be usable by such smartphones.

79
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.950 
So here is the possibility to add

80
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.940 
a new meaning by taking into account the local context

81
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.320 
of a person is a characteristic, so the web sees, understand, knows

82
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.770 
where the person is located and then

83
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.410 
it is able to provide resources that are meaningful exactly

84
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.320 
in this local context.

85
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.360 
So the largely use of

86
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:20.720 
the service web of web services this is a characterization of this mobile

87
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.100 
web as well as a usable

88
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.940 
in a mobile way.

89
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.210 
This is the end what comes next

90
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.210 
how web 5.0 looks like.

91
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.860 
Discussion about this

92
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:45.540 
you invite to develop your ideas in our forum and our openHPI for room

93
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.030 
to submit your ideas discuss ideas

94
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:56.910 
there are definitely new developments the web can go on and for the

95
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.230 
people for the developers of the web technologies, this visions,

96
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.060 
this new ideas are very important to think,

97
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:10.420 
to get input for developing new technologies.

98
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.650 
So in this week we speak about the social semantic and service web or the

99
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.860 
web 3.0.

100
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.170 
These three aspects are important social.

101
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.040 
What is the social web applications, you know, a lot of them.

102
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:48.130 
How do they how did they emerge how do they work the technology

103
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.420 
they are using? We have already discussed for example AJAX

104
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.410 
and the main characteristic. I already mentioned is that people

105
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.910 
you and me can become resources, can

106
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.830 
publish information in the world wide web.

107
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.300 
Then we speak about semantic web,

108
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.470 
How do today's search engines work and what are their limitations?

109
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.990 
What are semantic? And what are the principles of semantic web?

110
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.460 
This is what we ask ourself when we discuss

111
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.080 
semantic web, what's going on is development and what is the vision.

112
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.360 
And then finally we have to consider the service web

113
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:36.090 
how do web services is the enabling technology for the service web

114
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.640 
work?How is the technology,

115
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.430 
which kind of technology is in place to implement this vision

116
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.420 
of a service web?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300 
As you all know
cancer is a very

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.700 
devastating disease for the
patients, it's a leading

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.110 
cause of death worldwide
and globally increasing.

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.140 
It's not only terrifying
for the people

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.180 
but it also obviously
causes a lot of costs so

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.220 
for instance in Germany
35 billion euros

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.260 
per year is the estimated
cost caused by cancer.

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.320 
Chemotherapy for a patient
costs about 50 to 100

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
thousand euros per year.

10
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.380 
The problem, one problem
is that cancer is a

11
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.420 
complex disease which means
it's difficult to treat

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.470 
which you can see for
instance for chemotherapy,

13
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.490 
the success rate
is about 30 %.

14
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.540 
The difficulty is that
every patient is different

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.570 
because every patient has a different
genome, a different proteome,

16
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.610 
every tumor is different,
there are small mutations

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.650 
that cause the tumor to behave
differently or to respond differently

18
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.690 
to a certain drug. That
makes the treatment

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.730 
very difficult and currently we
have no reliable way to predict

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.770 
which chemotherapy
will be

21
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.790 
successful for patients.

22
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.840 
The same chemotherapy might
work in one patient with

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.860 
a certain tumor and it will not
work in the other one although

24
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.900 
the tumors from the outside
may look very similar,

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.920 
some location, the
patient may be similar

26
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.950 
from the phenotype, but these
small mutations make it really

27
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.990 
difficult to find a good
treatment for an individual

28
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.104 
patient. What we have
to do is we have to

29
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:49.109 
find new ways
of treating

30
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.113 
patients and the stratified
medicine that we that

31
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.115 
we've been doing for
hundreds of years

32
00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.118 
doesn't really work so
well in these cancer

33
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.124 
patients. Stratified medicine
uses statistical methods

34
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.127 
to find groups of
patients for which

35
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.131 
certain drugs
work. You cluster

36
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.134 
the patients basically according
to their phenotype, like

37
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:18.138 
where the tumor is located,
what background they have maybe,

38
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.141 
then you do clinical studies
and try to find the best drug

39
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.144 
that works on the certain
group. Personalized medicine

40
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.148 
on the other hand
tries to target

41
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:33.153 
each individual patient
and tries to taylor

42
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.156 
a treatment to this
individual patient with all

43
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.160 
the specific traits of the patient,
like the genome, the protium

44
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.163 
and so on and the
mutations that

45
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:49.169 
cause the cancer. How can
we do this for cancer? how

46
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.173 
can doctors find the best chemotherapy
for an individual patient?

47
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.175 
That is the basic goal.

48
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:59.179 
The start up that we
have been collaborating

49
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.182 
with, Alacris Theranostics, 
have been working

50
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.185 
on this problem. What
they have done is

51
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:10.190 
they have developed a
virtual model for cancer

52
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.195 
cells, basically they've
taken the known pathways

53
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.203 
that represent the metabolism
in the cell and only

54
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:27.207 
a subset of this metabolism
and they can model that. The

55
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.211 
idea is to simulate
whether treatment will

56
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.215 
work or not, the idea
is very nice, I mean

57
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:39.219 
that's been done in
engineering for many years.

58
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.221 
When you when you
build an airplane

59
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:46.226 
you don't build it right
away, you simulate it

60
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:51.231 
in the computer first.
How does that model

61
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:56.236 
look like?
The metabolism

62
00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:01.241 
in the cell is basically a
complex network of chemical

63
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.245 
reactions, certain genes
encode certain proteins,

64
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.248 
these proteins interact with
each other. We will hear a little

65
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.250 
bit more about that
in the next talk also.

66
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.253 
These proteins
can also inhibit

67
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:18.258 
the production of other proteins,
so you have a very complex

68
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:22.262 
networks of these
chemical objects that

69
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:27.267 
interact with each other.
We've now come to a point where

70
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.271 
we understand some parts
of these interactions quite

71
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:37.277 
well. The hope is that by
including the pathways that are

72
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:41.000 
known to be relevant
for cancer and trying to

73
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.285 
model these in the computer
we can simulate how

74
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:49.289 
a treatment will work for a
patient. This is still not clear

75
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.292 
whether this really
works, there are some

76
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.295 
very promising results
but it still has to be

77
00:04:55.295 --> 00:05:00.300 
validated in clinical trials
but that's the approach

78
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.303 
of this startup.
They have this model

79
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.306 
with about 50 cancer
relevant pathways, about 600

80
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:10.310 
genes and this is a a
very big complex network.

81
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.314 
From this complex
network how do

82
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:19.319 
we find a treatment for a particular
patient, for an individual

83
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.323 
patient. The idea is now to take
samples from the patient, from

84
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:29.329 
the tumor, get
the molecular and

85
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:34.334 
genetic information and modify
the model such that it represents

86
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.337 
the particular tumor
of this patient.

87
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.343 
The reaction network is in
general the same but maybe some

88
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:48.348 
pathways are inhibited
in one of the,

89
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.350 
in one patient because
there's a mutation,

90
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.353 
maybe the reaction
rates are different.

91
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:57.357 
This whole network is modified
and is adapted to the individual

92
00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:02.362 
patient. Combining this
generic model with the

93
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:07.367 
patient data we can arrive at a
virtual model for an individual

94
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:12.372 
patient and this
is basically a

95
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:16.376 
big equation system
that we have to solve

96
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:20.380 
and that was a big
challenge for Alacris.

97
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.385 
They had this model but they
they did not have the power to

98
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.388 
simulate that. the
problem was that

99
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.392 
you have about 3,000 components
that you have to simulate,

100
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.395 
you want to simulate
maybe 100 drugs

101
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.399 
ten doses for ten
different tissue types

102
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.403 
and for statistical
purposes we have to do

103
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.406 
monte carlo sampling also
of these simulations.

104
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:51.411 
This problem has many
different dimensions and

105
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.415 
you can see here an example
for just one patient,

106
00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.419 
for 100 drugs, ten
doses and on a 100

107
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.422 
core machine it would have taken
seven months to simulate that

108
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.424 
with their set up.

109
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.428 
That was obviously
not viable, I mean

110
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:12.432 
there is no
time for such

111
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:19.439 
a long simulation, right. Why are
these simulations so complicated

112
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.442 
or why do they
take so long?

113
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.447 
They are basically
differential equations and

114
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.450 
they have a particular
structure or the problem is that

115
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.454 
these reactions happen
at very different

116
00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.457 
time scale. Some of these
chemical reactions are very fast

117
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:42.462 
you can see here the
concentrations of these

118
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.464 
proteins and

119
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:48.468 
so on as a function of time and
what you want to find is the

120
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.471 
steady states, so
the final result

121
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.475 
after a long time.
You see there,

122
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.478 
some concentrations
saturate very quickly, they

123
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.481 
happen on a very fast
time scale and some

124
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.484 
take very long
time scale. That's

125
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.486 
really tough to
simulate because

126
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.489 
these different time
scales make it difficult,

127
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.491 
you can imagine that
you have to resolve

128
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.495 
small time steps for
these fast variables

129
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.499 
but you have to simulate on a
large time scale to resolve the

130
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:24.504 
transience so to say. What
we've done is we've implemented

131
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:28.508 
a optimized solver
for this system.

132
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.513 
What this solver does
is basically we take

133
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.516 
the model equations do symbolic
manipulation, everything

134
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:40.520 
that we can do before hand, before
the actual simulation try to

135
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.525 
calculate that symbolically,
we then generate a custom

136
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.528 
C++ code and compile
their two shared library

137
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.532 
and then during the run
time reload that library and

138
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:56.536 
let that run. We tailor this
this solver so to say for

139
00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:00.540 
each model that that
you want to simulate

140
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.544 
and they change
the model often

141
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.547 
I mean they have to improve that
so that happens actually quite

142
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.551 
a lot. What we
achieved was a speed up

143
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.553 
of about 5,000,
factor 5,000 so

144
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.557 
for this example
of one patient

145
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.559 
instead of seven months
it now takes about

146
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.563 
one hour. That's really an
improvement and it makes

147
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.565 
it possible for them
to validate the model.

148
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:32.572 
They are now using
this solver and

149
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:36.576 
are writing the data
directly into the HANA

150
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.578 
database and
then they can

151
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:41.581 
slice and dice
the results

152
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:45.585 
to identify biomarkers for
instance, that would be one

153
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.588 
for the goal of them
to test hypotheses and

154
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.591 
to do statistical
analysis

155
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:56.596 
on this data set.
Let me come to a

156
00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:01.601 
to a small demo, this
is how an interface for

157
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.604 
a doctor could
look like.

158
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.609 
The vision is of course
to bring this once it has

159
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:13.613 
been validated and
proven to be successful,

160
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.616 
to bring this into the
clinics such that patients

161
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.620 
can, doctor can
simulate their

162
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.625 
patients directly
in some tool.

163
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.628 
This is a vision of how this
could look like, so for instance

164
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:33.633 
the doctor can
basically search

165
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.636 
for his patients
here and

166
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:42.642 
here you have a
representation of this virtual

167
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:46.646 
patient, this virtual model.
What you see here is this

168
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.649 
reaction network that
I've been talking about

169
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.652 
and this is the
generic model so the

170
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:58.658 
not personalized model
yet. The doctor can then

171
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:03.663 
add patient data, so for instance
gene expression data, dna mutation

172
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:08.668 
data to personalize this
model. When we now look at

173
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.671 
the model you see that
this graph has changed,

174
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.675 
some of these
components are greyed

175
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.678 
out so they do not occur
in the patient because

176
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.682 
he has a different type
of of protein maybe there.

177
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:26.686 
This model is
now personalized

178
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:30.690 
to the patient and you
can, the doctor could now

179
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.694 
start simulating all different
drugs that are in the database.

180
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.697 
All we have to know
is how the drug works

181
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.700 
in this interaction
network, which pathway

182
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.704 
is blocked which is how
it interacts in this

183
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.708 
in this network and let me
jump to the results here.

184
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:53.713 
In the end this simulation
has to be translated back

185
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.716 
into something
meaningful for the doctor

186
00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:01.721 
so there are some
indicators that are known

187
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:06.726 
to tell us how
strong the growth is,

188
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.729 
the growth rate of the
cancer. You can see here the,

189
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:13.733 
sorry for this
resolution makes the

190
00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:18.738 
UI look a little bit distorted
but what you can see here

191
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.741 
is basically all the
drugs that have been

192
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:23.743 
been simulated and

193
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.746 
this is a ranking
of the drug. You see

194
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.750 
the cancer
growth rate is

195
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.754 
strongest or has been
diminished the most

196
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.757 
by this drug and the
doctor could then

197
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.761 
also use
different types of

198
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.764 
criteria such as the risk
of metastases depending

199
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.767 
on what's more important
for the patient.

200
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:51.771 
Basically the idea is
to simulate all drugs

201
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.774 
that are available in the
system to see which drug works

202
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.776 
best for this
particular patient.

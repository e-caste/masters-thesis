1
00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:11.429 
Yes, we have three penalists and it is my pleasure to introduce the first penalist. This is Professor Doctor Uwe Aßmann, who has held the Chair of Software

2
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.550 
at the Technical University of Dresden for the last 18 years.

3
00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:21.879 
PhD on compiler optimisation at Karlsruhe and postdoctoral thesis on invasive software composition. And one of the

4
00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:30.190 
projects in the work of Prof. Aßmann's research group is the Highly Adaptive Energy Efficient Computing Initiative, of

5
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.229 
which he will now give us a brief overview of.

6
00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:46.640 
I've brought some slides, hope they're playable.

7
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:56.170 
Yes, so we had a special research area on energy efficient software

8
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.560 
in Dresden and I have to say, saving energy is quite hard, that's what I learnt.

9
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:10.079 
In several years of painstaking research. And the little talk here should be called: Energy efficient software applications

10
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.780 
with energy efficiency contracts.

11
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.090 
What does that mean?

12
00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:14.049 
Next slide, please.

13
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.450 
The caption is called Software Communism.

14
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:28.719 
I think we are still quite badly placed in terms of the cost of running software.

15
00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:29.980 
We discussed that this morning,

16
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.250 
actually it must cost something.

17
00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:38.250 
We put the plug in the socket, run something, our processor gets hot but doesn't really know,

18
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.939 
that it's going to cost, what we put on Google and so on.

19
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.450 
That's called communism,

20
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.920 
so the infinite availability of heating, for example, was a problem in the East Germany.

21
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.480 
You just turned up the heating and you had energy or the availability of certain resources that just happened to be -.

22
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.950 
they were then hoarded and were gone from the market for another five years.

23
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.449 
So we actually learned that everything has to cost something, otherwise the market doesn't work properly.

24
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.949 
The question is, of course, how do I do that with software?

25
00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:18.050 
We have already heard the washing machine today, this morning, that has also been our inspiration example.

26
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:26.009 
Every electrical appliance in the supermarket costs energy, we know that from the label levels, they are just changed now

27
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:32.199 
and for some years now we have also known how many kilowatt hours per year an appliance consumes on average.

28
00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:37.240 
And you look at it, can I afford it or do I want to spend a bit more money on a more economical appliance?

29
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.199 
device?  And what we experimented with in our special research area were app stores. So there was not only server work

30
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.750 
for software on the server, but also software on the mobile phone.

31
00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.860 
And you know so the normal AppStores, here for mail clients for example.

32
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.199 
They have a star rating and the AppStore that we imagine,

33
00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.150 
which has energy labels.

34
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.169 
So, you don't only have popularity labels, but you also have A-labels or B-labels.

35
00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:17.090 
for the energy consumption and then you can see, aha here I have a mail programme like K-9 Mail, that has an energy class

36
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.800 
A, but there are also some that are not so great. Like Hotmail is G, maybe better not to take and here you see already,

37
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.550 
that to make an AppStore like this, you have to benchmark a lot .

38
00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.050 
So you have to look a lot into the application and try to see its energy consumption.

39
00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.289 
And actually that is a problem,

40
00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:41.229 
for an e-mailer, I brought a model here.

41
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:47.349 
So e-mail of course has different functions like looking at the account, looking at the mail, putting the mail together and

42
00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.710 
so on.

43
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.150 
There are different transitions that you make as a user between the different activities.

44
00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.479 
The benchmarking then consists of simply measuring each state and each transition according to energy consumption:

45
00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.900 
What is a typical mail look at, what does that cost anyway?

46
00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.960 
That means I have to install a software or hardware profiler on my phone and I have to try to get all the transitions to work.

47
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.460 
from such a mail tool into the activities and that is quite tedious.

48
00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:20.350 
You can see that you have to measure a lot, but the advantage is of course that you now have a user profile,

49
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.649 
so your daily average use of the e-mail tool, then you can calculate how much energy you use on average.

50
00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.649 
per day and you can include that in the rating on an AppStore.

51
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.730 
And that suggests,

52
00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.529 
and that's one of my hypotheses today, that we actually need to write software differently.

53
00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:44.290 
So far we have made software with functional contracts, functional contracts, so we know roughly what a service like this is.

54
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.149 
and what it needs.

55
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:56.550 
But actually we need green contracts where we supply or need certain services at the certain energy consumption.

56
00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:06.769 
You can see that here with the UML notation, so on the left, the lolly pops check mail costs 1800 milliwatts and lasts 3.9 seconds

57
00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:07.250 
that.

58
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.279 
Browse mails more than 1614.

59
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:17.220 
Milliwatt and I need another component that provides the following services. Energy contracts are sort of green

60
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.899 
contracts for software components.

61
00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:25.269 
And they specify the energy consumption at a given performance, both on the offered side for a component,

62
00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:30.850 
and on the required side, so provider and providing interfaces both need to be specified or determined.

63
00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:37.420 
and then you can actually assemble your software, just like you would normally assemble software, but you can

64
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.519 
calculate the energy consumption and then classify it in an AppStore like this, that is

65
00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:51.899 
You actually have to do measurements, benchmarking for all the components that you use in software engineering -

66
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:58.509 
at least for the atomic ones, you have to find out on your hardware - and the others, you have to make certain measurements.

67
00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:05.000 
variants that use the nuclear components and energy contracts have to be created for all components,

68
00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.050 
either calculated or specified.

69
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.029 
So you can actually make app stores like that.

70
00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:22.720 
And if you want to know more, I'll be happy to give you some literature references from us and doctoral theses. Thank you!

71
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.360 
Thank you for the impulse.

72
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:33.730 
We will make enquiries after the next Hennen co-participant. This is Mr Ingobert Veit, who has been the Vice-President of

73
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:41.800 
Public Policy at Huawei, with a focus on policy and regulatory issues related to digitalisation.

74
00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:47.149 
and before the ten years already six years as a consultant in a very similar field, namely in the energy and gas industry

75
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.569 
Energy and gas infrastructure projects.

76
00:06:50.540 --> 00:07:00.519 
So, two decades of experience that we're hearing about now.
Yes, almost thank you very much. I don't know, can everybody hear me over the Mirko? Yes? All right.

77
00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:06.329 
Well, we are on the panel Blue Prints for Energy Efficient Digital Systems today and I would like to spend the next few minutes

78
00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:10.420 
to give you our perspective,

79
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.779 
from Huawei -- that's the company I work for -- to show you what we believe is the right path in this direction.

80
00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:17.149 
is.

81
00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:31.050 
Before I jump in, I'd like to give you a quick update on
on how we see digital evolving by 2030,

82
00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.949 
which are definitely framework conditions that are also important for our topic today.

83
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:45.000 
On the one hand, we assume that we will have one billion virtual reality and augmented reality users by 2030.

84
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.550 
will.

85
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:54.459 
In the transport sector, which has also been mentioned several times this morning, we will have 60% so-called New V "X Enabled Vehicles.

86
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.910 
see.

87
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:03.250 
This means that there is communication between vehicles, but also between vehicles and infrastructures, other road users.

88
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:12.139 
And in general we assume that there will be a monthly data volume of 600 gigabytes on average.

89
00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:19.660 
So all these applications that we're seeing there are going to have a huge impact on the network and the corresponding

90
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.850 
capacities.

91
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.939 
In the industrial sector, we will see a continuation of what we are now seeing in the tender beginnings in Germany.

92
00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:30.019 
at the moment.

93
00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:35.830 
These are first 5G campus networks that are being built, we assume by 2030,

94
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:45.539 
that we will see around one million such networks globally. That goes along with a global data volume of one iota byte.

95
00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:49.009 
We had seen immense numbers now this morning as well,

96
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:57.549 
I think that impressively underlines the trend that we expect here and also the movements towards cloud application,

97
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:04.240 
also especially mobile in the edge, which I think we will come to later.

98
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.250 
So we're assuming that 87% of that is going into the application.

99
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:17.990 
And now here to our topic, I would like to point out first of all, this is our perspective,

100
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:23.259 
globally, that is, it is a global means. Looking at renewable energy, we believe that by.

101
00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:30.350 
2030, something like that, that 42% of the global energy supply will come from renewables.

102
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.169 
Now come the two crucial points, I would say.

103
00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:36.960 
have already been sufficiently discussed this morning.

104
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:45.600 
On the one hand, we believe very strongly that the emission reductions that we need to bring about are not going to happen without

105
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.379 
ICT

106
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:48.700 
can happen, so ICT is going to be a

107
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:59.200 
fundamental lever. But at the same time, of course, the ICT sector is a big emitter of CO2, which in turn, however, so

108
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.450 
our assumption, will reduce its own emissions by about half.

109
00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:14.549 
This actually brings us to the actual topic of our panel, and we as Huawei have our focus in network infrastructure,

110
00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:21.320 
that is, our focus is on the network and on the hardware components that you need to make the network and

111
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.750 
to provide the computing resources for it.

112
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:34.220 
Preliminarily, my message here today is: we don't believe in individual or specific technologies that will help us to

113
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.879 
sustainability or emissions targets.

114
00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:45.049 
From our point of view, it has to be a holistic approach, especially with regard to the grid, going across different areas.

115
00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:53.679 
On the one hand, and I think this has already been mentioned in one place or another this morning, we think it is important to keep a close eye on the network.

116
00:10:53.679 --> 00:11:02.120 
the switch from electrical or, the transition from electrical switches to optical switches or one of the optical switches.

117
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:09.940 
can generally be said to be an introduction of as complete an optical signal routing as possible for an absolute key element.

118
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:15.549 
In this way, very high energy savings can take place.

119
00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:20.509 
We're not just talking about optical systems in the access area.

120
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:26.690 
So Mr. State Secretary Schnur, was talking about optical fibre here, or I think also, Mr. Rohleder had mentioned that,

121
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.919 
but also in the network behind it, it is very important that this transformation takes place to the optical switches.

122
00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:39.649 
into the data centres themselves, which no longer have to be switched electrically, but optically.

123
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:48.649 
These are levers that are very important in order to achieve the desired energy efficiencies here.

124
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:57.559 
Another big issue has also already come to bear today, 5G - a mobile phone standard that will deliver significant energy efficiencies

125
00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:00.750 
compared to previous generations.

126
00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.759 
Important perhaps to say at this point: why is that?

127
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:12.750 
With 5G we have a much higher antenna capacity, which enables a new principle, the so-called beam forming.

128
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:24.169 
And so far in mobile communications, it's been the case that in a cell, virtually at every point, an equal amount of radio waves for the subscriber

129
00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:31.570 
and beam forming is now the approach to make this dynamic and more targeted, that is,

130
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:38.129 
the waves adapt to the movements of the participant in the cell.

131
00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:44.129 
So in other words, the whole cell is no longer irradiated, but only the area where the action is going on, and the

132
00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:47.470 
are very important principles that we call

133
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.539 
Zero Byte Zero Watt.

134
00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:56.610 
So if there is no activity on the grid, then there must be no power consumption and these are these fundamental

135
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:05.220 
leaps that help us do that and these are principles that have to be applied at different points in the grid.

136
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:16.570 
System engineering, from our point of view as a hardware manufacturer, is also a factor that is often underexposed in the debate.

137
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:25.419 
It's about quite physical things, like higher integration of antennas in mobile communications, that's where we see the trend.

138
00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:32.070 
or we are also a very innovative company with our products, that less and less components are connected to the antenna.

139
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.750 
itself, but the antenna itself is becoming more powerful.

140
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:41.980 
This makes it possible, for example, to build the antenna higher - five to six metres higher - and thus achieve higher coverage.

141
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:50.750 
So more power with less energy input, coupled with elements like in the photovoltaic supply of any antenna site,

142
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.450 
which has so far been fed from the normal electrical grid.

143
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.509 
Then Holistic Set Up.

144
00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:06.759 
Again, we are at quite physical and concrete details, if we now go back to the Data Centre area, we have

145
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:15.259 
we have implemented around 1000 projects worldwide and have come to the conclusion that, for example, in the superstructure,

146
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:24.080 
if concrete is not used as a building material to a large extent, up to 50% CO2 measures can be achieved.

147
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:31.649 
This can be replaced by modular, prefabricated elements, which can then also be recycled.

148
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:40.929 
And we just had it here in the students' challenge, clearly the Data Centres can be linked to this from their location positioning.

149
00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:48.240 
where the renewables are, these are of course important factors that have to be taken into account and which are then

150
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:55.980 
help to bring down the so-called Power Usage Effectiveness, we already have many successful projects here as well.

151
00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.940 
Last but not least, the operations run differently than before.

152
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:09.129 
We have the possibility to work and maintain remotely here on the networks because of the digitalisation, which is of course

153
00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:16.100 
the saving of staff and of travel costs and movements in that direction.

154
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:24.549 
On-site maintenance based on AI is also a very important factor and helps to optimise the networks and, for example.

155
00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:31.039 
to really not generate power consumption where there is no grid load.

156
00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:35.740 
Very important and here I am back to the starting point, the holistic view of the whole.

157
00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:41.840 
Of course, these individual measures only make sense if you have an overall view, an overall goal to which you can link the

158
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:48.100 
aligned. And here we now have, as one of the first companies, the so-called Network Carbon Emission Indicator.

159
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:56.840 
which is a service for our customers to have a concentrated overview in the dashboard, so to speak, of where the carbon emissions are.

160
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:04.220 
the carbon emissions in the network are taking place in the components. And that's not a simple, it's not a one-dimensional, so to speak.

161
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:12.429 
parameter, but it covers a wide variety of areas. It's about the Computing Usage Effectiveness, so in the server itself...

162
00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:17.200 
in the computing capacity, to look there: Where are my loads actually?

163
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:23.519 
This goes to the network level that has already been mentioned, access networks, but also the transport network behind it and goes up to

164
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:30.870 
to the site level, i.e. where the sites for the mobile networks are located and the Power Usage Effectiveness talked about

165
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:40.019 
I mentioned, very important topic for data centres. And this indicator is supposed to help the customer, the user, to really get to the

166
00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:48.519 
right levers, in its entire operation, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption.

167
00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:50.149 
down as much as possible.

168
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:59.649 
Dear thanks, thank you very much for the impulse!

169
00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:08.400 
Especially in the area of networking, we haven't heard that much today. And the last speaker is Mr Björn Brundert from VM Ware.

170
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.349 
Björn Brundert has been a Principal Technologist for 12 years and works, is also on the leadership team of Central Europe, Middle East and Africa.

171
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:27.029 
He's part of the VM Ware Office, Office of the CTO, and works with a lot of customers, a lot of partners and will give us an overview

172
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:36.319 
what blueprints there are to learn.

173
00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:42.450 
Hello everybody, I'm really looking forward to finally interacting with an audience on site again.

174
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.259 
So first of all thank you very much for the invitation and that we can be here today.

175
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:53.220 
I would like to talk a little bit about the topic, 20 years of climate protection in the data centre. I chose that as a heading.

176
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:58.039 
We look a lot into the future, what is possible in the future, what has to be done?

177
00:17:58.059 --> 00:18:02.140 
I would like to know a little bit about what is pragmatically already possible today, or rather, what can be done in the future?

178
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:09.430 
what has already been achieved in the past years? And perhaps we need to backtrack a little. VM Ware is

179
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:16.390 
to some people it's a term from the applications, application development maybe, local virtual machines.

180
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.900 
machines on a Mac or on the Windows base.

181
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:28.450 
The basic idea with which VM Ware started over 20 years ago was: How can server systems be made more efficient? The

182
00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:31.930 
efficiency and the performance of individual CPUs

183
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:37.309 
has grown steadily, memory has become cheaper, that is, how to consolidate, so to speak?

184
00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:43.589 
And what the basic idea was was: how can you increase this efficiency of individual system by increasing the packing density?

185
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:52.589 
increased. And we're now at a point that about 85 million workloads on like in the VM Ware technology, that's the way to do it.

186
00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:53.930 
are running globally today.

187
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.869 
In the pictures it's still like 6 to 1.

188
00:18:56.869 --> 00:19:00.509 
But the consolidation rates are definitely much, much, much higher.

189
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:08.509 
We do have systems where there is 100 to 1 consolidation and therefore of course a lot of new hardware not

190
00:19:08.509 --> 00:19:09.299 
needed.

191
00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:15.829 
Meanwhile, the technology also exists, that's a bit of the basic idea also for cloud computing, so the pooling of

192
00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:19.259 
resources to then make them available in a different way.

193
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:25.450 
This technology now exists ... Service from the big hyper-scalers, so actually from all hyper-scalers.

194
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.960 
and from over 4000 service providers globally, so at the end of the day a virtual hyper scalers cloud, if you have

195
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.400 
if you like, which is very local, very regional in part. And the idea has evolved,

196
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.099 
it's not just abstracting compute and memory anymore, it's actually going there,

197
00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:46.740 
actually abstracting the whole data centre. So also network, virtual machines, a server also needs somewhere.

198
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:49.309 
Firewall rules that need to be configured somewhere.

199
00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:55.569 
Why not bring the firewall rules to the virtual machine and virtually before any packet communication to a

200
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:58.789 
cable goes say: Okay, is this allowed or not?

201
00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:05.410 
So to allow decentralisation of the security components and to sort of bring the execution to where it's actually

202
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:05.849 
belongs.

203
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:12.259 
We see that just not only in the enterprise environment and classic data centre operations, so from a company that has

204
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:19.210 
in the telecommunication world, so even core telecommunication infrastructure is virtualised.

205
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:23.180 
In healthcare, it doesn't really matter where you look today.

206
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:30.039 
The this enabling technology, abstracting resources, that's what we're actually looking at

207
00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:31.519 
every place. If you look,

208
00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:36.680 
what areas VM Ware has actually been in over the last few years:

209
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:43.009 
So once to create this abstraction layer, to create virtual programmable infrastructure, that it's certainly

210
00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:49.390 
this whole magic of abstraction, that actually runs through our company history. But also has some

211
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:55.470 
hardware independence, I can decouple the hardware life cycle a little bit, what do I actually need?

212
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.019 
or

213
00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:59.910 
when does that make sense and don't just do that respectively

214
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.089 
have the possibility to react to it more dynamically.

215
00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:08.500 
But I also have load balancing, which we saw earlier in the hackathon, where this idea of workloads from a

216
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:17.529 
place to another, that's actually still something that affects many, many, many systems on a daily basis that are

217
00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:19.130 
within the country respectively

218
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.549 
partially moved to the cloud and back again.

219
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.779 
That of course needs some abstraction and then I mean I myself when I started at VM Ware were active passive

220
00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:34.539 
data centres still an issue you had coal standby data centre in case of disaster and it was just turned on

221
00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:38.519 
or could only be used if you had quasi disaster.

222
00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:42.230 
Since has to use the whole thing more efficiently and do load balancing is one thing.

223
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.109 
Of course that has brought efficiency, but today we also see that in new workloads, so whether that is machine learning or

224
00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:49.380 
artificial intelligence.

225
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:58.289 
How can I bring a workload that is supposed to handle Artificial Intelligence topics closer to a piece of hardware for example that is

226
00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:04.690 
special hardware, the GPU, DPU, which are installed in the server systems today, and how can I bring it closer to the workload?

227
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.349 
to be executed remotely and to allow these accesses via the network, respectively.

228
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:16.369 
to virtually share these virtual resources, these physical resources, virtual desktops during the day.

229
00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:23.400 
with high performance CRD applications and to train models for this at night, which then use this technology accordingly.

230
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:29.569 
also use. And then, of course, we have the situation to look into the systems better, to understand them better.

231
00:22:29.569 --> 00:22:34.259 
Measurability was a huge topic, that's something that also drives our clients, where we say Hey, how can we help?

232
00:22:34.339 --> 00:22:40.440 
the concrete power consumption and the concrete emissions of a virtual machine really concretely and

233
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.009 
then of course also to derive trends respectively

234
00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:47.160 
to understand at what times I can perhaps use one or the other?

235
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.029 
I myself accompanied a client, they had the situation: What do we do now, why we new data centre? We need

236
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:59.299 
because the power supply of the data centre was never designed for that, they didn't have such a great planning company.

237
00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:05.420 
who supported them, and the need became greater than they had expected. There was a decision to be made from the second on.

238
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.849 
we need a new data centre or we consolidate. And they did consolidate radically.

239
00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:15.779 
They've actually gone into the mode where they're dynamically not just moving the machines back and forth in the data centre

240
00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:19.619 
but let the host systems move up and down,

241
00:23:19.849 --> 00:23:20.759 
as needed.

242
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.730 
If there was no need at night, the data centre, the data centre just turned off lots of resources, and in the morning,

243
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.490 
when the demand came back, they were automatically brought back up.

244
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:35.150 
And it has brought some possibilities, what I also often them is the theme of Zombie Hunting.

245
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:41.609 
That you really look in the data centre, which workloads are actually active and which are not active and which are not active.

246
00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:48.839 
you can maybe proactively switch off by continuously monitoring that and reacting to it accordingly.

247
00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:52.559 
What there are as focus areas in the meantime,

248
00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:56.720 
so I have already said, there is now this technology actually from every hyper-scaler, that is this

249
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.240 
topic of cloud infrastructure everywhere, and not only in the big central data centres, but at the end

250
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.049 
of the day, anywhere that compute capacity is needed.

251
00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:12.519 
In the edge, in the factory, in the hospital, the bottom line is - I said it - no matter what industry you look at, compute capacity is

252
00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:19.450 
is needed everywhere and having a uniform, programmable model is a very important issue.

253
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:26.769 
The other thing, of course, is the development of new applications and we've spent a lot of energy over the last few years, so

254
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:33.829 
personal energy, into the further development of open source cubernators, of container technologies. How can you use these

255
00:24:33.829 --> 00:24:39.299 
virtual world and this abstracted data centre world with the new open source technologies to bring the

256
00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:45.349 
consumption of it as easy as possible, but at the same time also to help companies to create more efficient software.

257
00:24:45.349 --> 00:24:45.660 
build?

258
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:52.359 
And we've heard this several times now, I can program my application a million different ways,

259
00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:57.329 
it can be very efficient, but it can also be not so good due to just bad programming technique, and

260
00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:03.160 
we have with our team, we have a Labs Team, ... Labs team is what it's called, who sort of sit down with our clients,

261
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:09.670 
software development practices and then implement them and then we pull back again and the customer scales up

262
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:16.259 
this know-how in their own company. That is a very central aspect and there are also components that play a role such as how do we use this know-how?

263
00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:23.380 
I use modern technologies like blockchain, we did blockchain research at a very early stage, we looked at okay, how can we use these technologies?

264
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:30.500 
quite energy-efficient Bitcoin architecture more efficient, because of course today we're talking about introducing

265
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.349 
of digital currency at the state level, this should not be done like Bitcoin, please. Otherwise we all have a huge problem

266
00:25:36.349 --> 00:25:42.269 
and have a very long time to nibble at it, to map the whole thing sensibly again. And the last aspect is of course this

267
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:44.430 
Anywhere Workspace issue, respectively

268
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:50.809 
Anywhere Workforce. We all noticed this during the pandemic, how quickly you have to allow overnight that the

269
00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:53.119 
staff to work from anywhere, respectively

270
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:58.549 
the employees may not even want to come back to the office. And this transformation, which is also again

271
00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:04.309 
in terms of inclusiveness, has taken companies a whole step forward, when you suddenly have new working models, new ways of working, new ways of working.

272
00:26:04.309 --> 00:26:06.890 
that is a very central aspect.

273
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.369 
And what has that achieved in the last 20 years?

274
00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:14.700 
If we just look now, what was the actual impact of our of our core product, not so much, so really

275
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.269 
Visualisation technology.

276
00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:17.660 
What did that do? We have

277
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:26.549 
a study that is very conservative actually of the assumptions, suggesting over 140 million servers avoided being built,

278
00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:28.859 
so helped the customer not to build them.

279
00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:40.150 
The second one is 1.2 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, that's about double, double the emissions that Germany

280
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:49.970 
generated in 2020, so pi by thumb, and in terms of energy savings, it's actually three times the annual consumption.

281
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:57.940 
of the Federal Republic in 2020. We have avoided that over the last, that is, from 2003 to 2019.

282
00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:04.000 
It still goes on, of course, through this situation that there is accordingly the issue, but and that have

283
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.099 
we have already heard this morning from State Secretary Schnur that it is not enough to look only at Sustainability.

284
00:27:09.109 --> 00:27:13.619 
we also have to look, and diversity was already a topic earlier,

285
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.599 
we also have to look at how do we go beyond that?

286
00:27:15.609 --> 00:27:17.549 
System Mobility is an important aspect.

287
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:24.779 
We have set up an Agenda 2030 or 2030 Agenda for us as a company, sustainability is a central point,

288
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:27.140 
but also

289
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.210 
Equality a very central aspect.

290
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.130 
It's really about how do you create an inclusive working atmosphere?

291
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.180 
How do you really move goals forward?

292
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.990 
And these are not just any high level goals, these are actually centrally anchored in the business strategy.

293
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:48.250 
They have to be implemented and yes, this is in the end a short overview of what has happened there in the last time.

294
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:54.109 
We are of course, as I said, involved in various developments, especially with regard to modern applications, with regard to these new

295
00:27:54.109 --> 00:28:03.930 
technologies. If you are interested, if you want to know more, you can read the Aurora Report.

296
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:10.049 
download via the QR COde and otherwise thank you for your attention, looking forward to the panel now.

297
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:23.660 
Thank you very much for the great breadth from cloud networks to EDGE in the AppStore to the network.

298
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.319 
Do you have any questions?

299
00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:27.759 
I have a few, but you have priority.

300
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:35.740 
A pair of hand signals.

301
00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:43.650 
If I, I would have a question for Professor Aßmann: In your paper you said, will the, do you see a very small

302
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:51.059 
level of granularity, namely the application as a state machine and to now determine the energy consumption,

303
00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:58.210 
he yes probably additive when path is traversed in the state machine, but how the path is traversed,

304
00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:04.599 
depends on the user interaction, how did you map it and how much, how sensitive is it, so to speak,

305
00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:11.160 
the quantification of energy consumption to the user behaviour itself, so how much later users actually play a role in your

306
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.039 
studies? Yes, you have to.

307
00:29:18.039 --> 00:29:22.039 
I hope that works out.

308
00:29:22.039 --> 00:29:27.210 
It's like you have to create a user profile and then actually add up.

309
00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:30.220 
This is very important.

310
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:37.849 
That is, you still need a probabilistic automaton, which is the counterpart of the application and the

311
00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:44.599 
probabilities in the propabilistic automata then tell you how likely it is that now from the overall view

312
00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:47.200 
of the mailer app will now open a mail?

313
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:54.680 
And that is of course the question, how realistic is such a probabilistic automaton, or are there different user groups,

314
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.660 
that have different usage profiles and so on.

315
00:29:58.589 --> 00:30:03.500 
That's relatively okay, so you can map that quite well with reality.

316
00:30:03.589 --> 00:30:14.089 
The problem is that a mail application is not a whole IT stack, and if I have 10 or 15 or 10,000 mailer apps, I can't use them all.

317
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:15.329 
open -

318
00:30:15.329 --> 00:30:18.849 
what is it then? We did not investigate that, but

319
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:24.950 
we did it at app level first, and it's very interesting that the apps differ a lot.

320
00:30:26.069 --> 00:30:30.980 
These models that I've shown, they become very different for the individual apps.

321
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:38.390 
So there also seems to be lots of bugs, in programming energy bugs that come out of what are called energy smells,

322
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:43.869 
that you program in and you don't find them because the programmers don't test them, they don't do any testing.

323
00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:44.720 
energy tests.

324
00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:53.420 
So, that's, that's a couple of issues. There are questions in the audience,

325
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.140 
can also repeat them if

326
00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:25.640 
yes ... (question from the audience)

327
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.369 
Nah, those are, certainly didn't happen now.

328
00:31:28.369 --> 00:31:33.660 
So you would have to measure the network extra then and the server application.

329
00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:40.349 
But you can do that, you can also put the larger scenario into one component and measure it.

330
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:46.769 
The app measurements is easy from there because they can put a phone on table, hardware profiler or software profiler.

331
00:31:46.769 --> 00:31:47.559 
on it.

332
00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:53.930 
And then you have a relatively precise energy consumption, if you want to measure the network as well and the server, then it will be

333
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:54.660 
more difficult

334
00:31:54.660 --> 00:32:00.809 
to encapsulate that as a unit of measurement. But there we have also done experiments, especially of course for such applications.

335
00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:06.259 
that don't have apps, we also did a lot of experimentation and energy benchmarking is very important.

336
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.849 
It is more difficult with the operating systems and VM Ware.

337
00:32:11.339 --> 00:32:20.319 
There are often layers in between and the work that has to be done is, I think, cross layer, which is the most difficult thing,

338
00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:26.460 
what happens now if there are ten VM goods on top of each other on the server and what happens if there are ten VMs on top of each other?

339
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:31.829 
thousands of apps on it and how can you optimise the overall cross layer?

340
00:32:31.829 --> 00:32:38.130 
I think there is very little work there and that is the big challenge for the future. But I find

341
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:44.789 
question - to perhaps briefly add - super exciting because of course this interconnectivity and just - I mentioned it earlier -

342
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:52.259 
Kubernetes cloud native application architecture, I mean a lot of the modern applications that we see today,

343
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.369 
that are being redeveloped now and there's going to be a few hundred million more in the next few years.

344
00:32:56.369 --> 00:33:01.049 
I actually think it's just that we're at the starting point of all this innovation.

345
00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:05.359 
Of course, a technology like Service Mesh plays a huge role.

346
00:33:05.369 --> 00:33:10.809 
So you could now extend the service mesh, so to speak, by a sustainability component, for example.

347
00:33:10.819 --> 00:33:17.019 
I think this is something that is actually not yet in the focus of the open source projects, for example.

348
00:33:17.019 --> 00:33:20.859 
but definitely something that would fit into the agenda.

349
00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:26.990 
You already monitor the utilisation of the services today, scale accordingly, but could you extend metrics there?

350
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:32.670 
which in turn make these backend services more transparent, because that's where the entire communication path ultimately runs.

351
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:36.349 
so I think that would be an approach where you can do that.

352
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.390 
On cross layer optimisations, we also found, as this was briefly mentioned in the discussion this morning, that.

353
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.940 
the operating system or the virtual machine, so all the underlying layers of the applications have to be connected to the applications.

354
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.359 
information in which context it is running.

355
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.369 
So is she running alone or is she running with 1000 others?

356
00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:56.849 
How many shifts are there in between?

357
00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:03.440 
That alone would greatly improve the ability of applications to self-optimise.

358
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.990 
But we don't have that today either.

359
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:12.130 
So a transparent information pass-through, I know, at the VM there are some things, but I think overall

360
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.550 
the problem is not solved yet.

361
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:21.469 
Overall, this is also a problem of programming, because we program without contextual knowledge, just program away and think

362
00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:28.960 
we are the only app. That's not true, we don't have any means of expression in programming languages where we can say:

363
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:34.219 
Am I now in mass operation, or am I alone, or am I off grid?

364
00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.969 
Can't express either, and that's contextual programming.

365
00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:44.289 
The HPI is doing a lot here and so also the objects and any software have to take a step forward in

366
00:34:44.289 --> 00:34:47.739 
the next few years.

367
00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:55.969 
I, I had a question about that, and it follows on a little bit: We talk a lot about optimising applications that are

368
00:34:55.969 --> 00:35:01.199 
ultimately the user has, their behaviour needs to be modelled, but from your practical experience -.

369
00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:07.429 
Which type applications would have the greatest potential to be optimised in terms of energy?

370
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:17.480 
Are these the classic database applications, apps, communication apps or yes? That's a very interesting question that we've been asking for years.

371
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:24.460 
for years. There seems to be four to five classes of energy behaviour for application.

372
00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:30.820 
First of all, there are the applications that use the least energy when they are running the fastest. There is energy

373
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:37.739 
and performance in parallel. Then there are the ones that have multiple sweet spots,

374
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.849 
so where you have to set, do I want this to run slow now and use little energy or the other way round.

375
00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:46.190 
And then there are the ones that only have a sweet spot.

376
00:35:46.449 --> 00:35:49.360 
Unfortunately, you can't see which application is which.

377
00:35:49.369 --> 00:35:58.500 
You have to measure that with energy benchmarking and I can't give you the standard answer there either, but

378
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:03.360 
I believe that energy testing and energy benchmarking will become an essential element of our software engineering.

379
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.130 
must

380
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.329 


381
00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:18.119 
Yes, so we come very much from the infrastructure and the network world and we have actually detached ourselves from that, since

382
00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:25.079 
on certain applications, but rather the other way round. We look at the requirements, at

383
00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:33.150 
the applications and see what can be done. So we had already touched on the issue of 5G, the 5G

384
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.269 
Characteristic

385
00:36:33.269 --> 00:36:40.329 
is the famous triangle. These are the three main parameters, this is a high data capacity on the one

386
00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:47.099 
side, secondly the low latency, that is the so-called network reaction speed, which is very crucial for

387
00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:54.190 
some applications and then it's about the amount of density of terminals that can be served at the same time and

388
00:36:54.190 --> 00:37:01.400 
these are first of all parameters that have to be guaranteed for the data flow. However, the customer who uses this, now for example

389
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:07.449 
on his 5G campus network or you can also take it over the broader network, can certainly vary again and there

390
00:37:07.449 --> 00:37:14.340 
he already has the possibility to influence, so to speak, the overall performance and an overall CO2 emission or energy consumption.

391
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:20.289 
So, maybe to elaborate a little bit on an example.

392
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.409 
Automated driving is a pretty important topic at the moment.

393
00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:26.590 
We've all just heard about it now,

394
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:33.820 
how Tesla has opened its production in Grünheide and Tesla relies, for example, in automated driving on an

395
00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:41.030 
video camera sensor technology, which means that the Teslas are all equipped with camera sensor technology in order to capture the data in this way

396
00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:50.070 
and then to control the vehicle or part of the vehicle accordingly. Of course, this is a very, very data-intensive process.

397
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:59.329 
approach and also requires a high performance computing mechanism in the car itself. And that leads to, for example.

398
00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:10.300 
that now the batteries and the power supply in the Tesla has to hold quite a lot for these camera sensors there.

399
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.929 
And of course that again has an impact on the overall performance.

400
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:22.289 
If, on the other hand, you now follow a different approach, which we strongly propagate, but also many other, let's say, OEMs, you have to take a different approach.

401
00:38:22.289 --> 00:38:29.630 
then that's using so-called LIDAR sensor technology, so not the cameras and then the

402
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:38.739 
data via a cloud edge and decentralise it a little bit further and then, let's say, pressure out of the cloud.

403
00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:48.159 
from the car to have to reserve a lot of energy there to process this data, because

404
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:57.309 
you sort of distribute that over the whole network and of course these are decisions that the customer can sort of, anyone can make.

405
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:59.010 
customer can make for himself.

406
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:06.570 
So Tesla goes one way, another manufacturer maybe another way. And that's where we would say, let's - and I had that.

407
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:13.570 
tried to say in my opening statement - in the end it depends on what comes out at the end of the day and how we do it.

408
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:20.579 
the overall performance is, and there you also have the possibility, depending on what your requirements are for your use case, of using

409
00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:26.829 
the parameters and we have to optimise them. And that's where we see ourselves as a hardware enabler, so to speak.

410
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:33.730 
who can perhaps help with this indicator that I mentioned, that is this

411
00:39:33.739 --> 00:39:42.300 
Network Carbon Emission Indicator, to see: Where is your consumption now and now you have to make a decision.

412
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:42.750 
make

413
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:50.820 
under scarce resources. And that's actually a classic management issue.

414
00:39:50.820 --> 00:40:17.710 
There is a question -

415
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:36.610 
(Question from the audience)

416
00:40:36.610 --> 00:41:14.550 


417
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:27.110 
I can try to give a short answer. On a macroscopic level, maybe VM is a good example,

418
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.730 
VMs to move or to group,

419
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:39.079 
there should always be financial costs involved, via a micropayment service for example, that you have to develop and implement.

420
00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:39.730 
At app level, it's probably quite difficult,

421
00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:50.380 
it's more that you pay for an app and then you have certain selection criteria of energy labels.

422
00:41:50.389 --> 00:42:00.300 
But for VMs I think it would be worthwhile to have PayPal or Visa or some other payment service,

423
00:42:00.409 --> 00:42:04.489 
that would charge. But maybe there's already something there, I don't know?

424
00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:15.650 
Regarding digital transformations - and this does not only refer to financial services - these are evolving rapidly

425
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:20.519 
because there are a lot of opportunities for development in the market.

426
00:42:20.519 --> 00:42:24.059 
For us, in these discussions, the focus is:

427
00:42:24.059 --> 00:42:31.860 
Let's raise which applications are easy to move or easy to modernise and let's start there.

428
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:40.469 
To take those and turn them into a different form factor.

429
00:42:40.469 --> 00:42:45.090 
transform is probably not the best option. Transformation has to be holistic,

430
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.219 
so let's look at the application architecture. Where do we need to change it?

431
00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:53.400 
If the company wants a cloud option,

432
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:59.210 
we have the VM Ware endpoint in all public clouds.

433
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.090 
Therefore, we can take the virtual machine and move it without

434
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:08.400 
the format or anything else. That's why you can just move it, from a public cloud.

435
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:16.599 
Of course you have the modernisation that happens within the organisation where the

436
00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:23.760 
Development Team has to learn these new skills first, learn to address that.

437
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:30.280 
Dismantling the monolith, how can we dismantle physical systems, or main frame systems that have been used for a long time.

438
00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:38.130 
How can we break these systems down into smaller building blocks, according to these new architectural ideas and standards, to make them more efficient.

439
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.610 
Finally, if one chooses the model of

440
00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:51.599 
"pay as you go", so for what you use, in a public cloud for example -

441
00:43:52.010 --> 00:44:00.000 
you are of course interested in making it as efficient as possible to pay less.

442
00:44:00.059 --> 00:44:05.000 
But if it doesn't run longer than necessary or

443
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.980 
does not consume more resources than necessary,

444
00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:13.110 
it naturally also helps to achieve the sustainability goals. So it's a win-win situation for the companies.

445
00:44:13.769 --> 00:44:17.210 
Investigating this is a daily task that we focus on.

446
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.210 
and that is a high priority.

447
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:29.360 
Maybe a follow-up question: when we talk about payment systems, it's probably about financial transactions,

448
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:36.369 
but if you look at, in the last ten years, the number of applications in the mobile space has increased significantly and there are

449
00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:41.789 
there is already the currency which is the battery charge. So if I have an application where my battery is running out of charge after a

450
00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:48.309 
half an hour, then I'm not going to install it. If there are such mailers, or such network apps, Facebook is a

451
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:51.019 
nice example - they really had to switch like that at some point because

452
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.909 
within a few hours this phone was empty.

453
00:44:53.719 --> 00:44:56.639 
It's called in the mobile sector, edge computing,

454
00:44:56.639 --> 00:44:57.590 
there is already a currency.

455
00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:05.469 
it's not financial, it's battery charge. Are there numbers for that, are there lessons, you just had to learn them in mobile

456
00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:07.239 
applications, because battery power just

457
00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:13.940 
is limited, is limited when I have to recharge again, after a few hours - which can now be transferred to

458
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.590 
the cloud scenario, where yes

459
00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:22.500 
not this obvious constraint of the battery going flat when the computation takes place.

460
00:45:22.989 --> 00:45:27.309 
So I personally think it's quite a great example where the, where the disciplines can learn from each other Front

461
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:34.420 
End and Back End, so if you look at, for example, if I'm in the big organisation.

462
00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:40.139 
where my software builds might take a while, where I'm using a gshart system to

463
00:45:40.139 --> 00:45:47.090 
to do that build, if my build since yesterday was kind of one minute and tomorrow is kind of five minutes, then that's

464
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:52.710 
that which should sort of ring an alarm bell within the organisation today.

465
00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:00.960 
We see that with us, even if we can reduce a compilation process for a product, because the complexity, that is

466
00:46:00.969 --> 00:46:03.989 
new feature, for example, doesn't have to mean that everything becomes more complex.

467
00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:09.679 
Sometimes it's also better to just take code out of the product briefly, make the product itself more efficient.

468
00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:12.480 
So that definitely -

469
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.400 
it's not about the lines of code that are there at the end of the day we sometimes a minus 10,000 lines of code is the best

470
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:25.380 
feature you could add and of course you learn from those experiences. Yes, I have another currency, the

471
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:33.119 
is our data oil if you do a Google query or anything, log in Amazon, they know what your

472
00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:39.199 
data is and nobody knows where it's going. And I'd actually like to see a business model where I can choose that.

473
00:46:39.199 --> 00:46:39.489 
can.

474
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.550 
So if I want to have free services okay, then I have to give my data and I have to be fully aware of that.

475
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:51.010 
but if I don't want to give my data and I want to stay anonymous or pseudonymous, then I'll pay a few cents. But

476
00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:56.389 
I don't even have the possibility to pay these cents today, because there is no Financial Transaction Service, which

477
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:03.480 
save my data oil. That to me would be a currency that is truly global and where at the beginning, when I'm looking at my browser state...

478
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:11.860 
want to say, a private window with money now. Nice, maybe to put in a personal episode.

479
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:17.039 
When Alexa was developed, the voice recognition had to be running because when I say the keyword,

480
00:47:17.039 --> 00:47:24.179 
Alexa, computer, Echo or Amazon it has to be recognised so that the speaker comes on and the classic one that's plugged into the socket

481
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:30.199 
used a relatively complex deep network when it was first released. But when it was going to be mobile,

482
00:47:30.769 --> 00:47:37.380 
it becomes portable, it couldn't be used because the battery in the one in the speaker ran out quite quickly.

483
00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:37.590 
would have been.

484
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:43.079 
In the end, a classical linear model learned with support vector machines was used for this wake word detection.

485
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:46.699 
and so published for power reasons and not for cost reasons.

486
00:47:47.480 --> 00:48:28.769 
You had a question - (question from the audience).

487
00:48:28.769 --> 00:48:34.219 
Eerst mal für Sie vielleicht die Frage im Hintergrund, die Problematik ist schlimmer, der Compiler kann Ihnen ein bisschen vielleicht

488
00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:40.869 
by choosing an energy-efficient implementation of the data structure, there's also work on that. But that

489
00:48:40.869 --> 00:48:47.530 
much worse problem is that you make an energy bug when you're programming. That is, you're programming something and you forget

490
00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.340 
turn off the GPS or something on the phone and that costs you the main energy.

491
00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.539 
That means energy tests are very important.

492
00:48:55.539 --> 00:49:01.789 
So we have to get used to not only using without share units, but we had made a framework called School Unit

493
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:08.079 
where you can actually with a software profiler then measure the energy consumption and the photos that they saw are based on

494
00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:09.489 
implicitly on that as well.

495
00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:14.780 
So I think we just need to change our software development and test energy more consciously.

496
00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:20.840 
So data structures clear, can do compiler, can help.

497
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.280 
But he doesn't find the big bugs. (Addition from the audience)

498
00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:41.820 
Yes, yes, that's quite an interesting question, which I don't think is, not well studied so, parallel programming languages

499
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.900 
have failed because of that, why because they don't do distribution well.

500
00:49:44.909 --> 00:49:52.159 
You always have to write the distribution yourself by hand, colleagues can tell many stories of, and when you

501
00:49:52.159 --> 00:49:57.969 
take the memory out of the programme and only programme functionally or in a different way, then you also have no memory.

502
00:49:57.969 --> 00:49:58.530 
term any more,

503
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.769 
how the algorithm works in the direction of memories.

504
00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:08.590 
On the contrary it will be better, you have realistic memory model, probably multi-level cashes up to disc,

505
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:16.039 
and you know what each memory move costs, because they cost energy, so they are an IO bound and application.

506
00:50:16.039 --> 00:50:21.880 
quite different from a CPU-bound application, for example, where we also have complete transparency, array is array.

507
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.420 
But that's not true, the compiler and the analysis could help.

508
00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:38.139 
All right, then maybe the last question: If I could just make one last comment on your question and because we have

509
00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:45.650 
the topic on the Mmicro Payments or what systems you can implement there now, that's not

510
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:49.590 
really our domain, but a little bit of distance I would maybe comment on that.

511
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:53.130 
Of course, we shouldn't lose sight of the big goal there either.

512
00:50:53.130 --> 00:51:01.800 
So that really leads to reductions in the effect and if you think about it commercially that you can

513
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:07.809 
that this is broken down transparently, then this is of course a commercial process and therefore of course they have obligations to provide evidence,

514
00:51:07.809 --> 00:51:14.800 
reporting obligations et cetera, so there's a lot that needs to be implemented so that you can sort of enforce that.

515
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:20.860 
So you create, let's say casually formulated an over head and then of course there is the danger that this over head is not implemented.

516
00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:29.760 
head then eats up the net saving again. Or now today we have already had quite often block chains are so the extreme

517
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.179 
Counter example, where this has now gone totally in the wrong direction.

518
00:51:34.059 --> 00:51:38.880 
Bitcoin, sorry, so Bitcoin via blockchain.

519
00:51:38.889 --> 00:51:47.679 
And there I have a few, so to speak, I would ask myself the question whether you are on the right track then.

520
00:51:47.679 --> 00:51:54.909 
So basically, that the user then or with his Google Hit has more transparency, what he triggers with it.

521
00:51:54.909 --> 00:52:03.210 
in order to sanction himself or to make other decisions in order to align his behaviour more sustainably.

522
00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:06.380 
is of course very welcome, but how much effort does that involve?

523
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:14.280 
And if you take this one level further, smaller companies, which have a completely different cost sensitivity, they have a completely different cost sensitivity.

524
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:21.210 
than larger ones, can of course also be impaired in their innovation processes, so that is certainly a good thing.

525
00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:30.059 
idea, good path, but you have to look at it, I think, overall, and I wouldn't be too sure about that.

526
00:52:30.059 --> 00:52:34.570 
Then thank you very much to all the panellists and for the discussion.

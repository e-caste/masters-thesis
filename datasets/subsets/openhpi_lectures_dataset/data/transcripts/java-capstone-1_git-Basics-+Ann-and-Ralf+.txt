WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.430 
and i today we are a little
different set up because we could

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.340 
get studio today it sunlight and
we are an academic triples

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.850 
next week so we need to get the
last videos finished right

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.420 
now say today we're going to talk
about version control which

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.840 
is really quite say let's say
we working attain and we want

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.170 
to remake how they
actually share our

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.450 
yeah i actually share
files were used is good

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.380 
it's good right yeah that's
what size can actually

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.370 
what the thing about my
do you know my inbox

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.560 
yeah my email program know
not going to happen

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.160 
and if you case you wandering also
flood storage is not a good

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.980 
choice say neither right nor
dropbox nor enclaves or even as

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.380 
at each and is not optimal
for so start believe us

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.810 
because there's something better
right because we've got certain

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.270 
requirements so whenever we develop
programs we already learned

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.540 
to team effort so we've
got many developers who

17
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.830 
edit many source foils so and
and many people are touching

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.370 
the same files in worst
case even simultaneously

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.350 
and even the same line of code
sometimes so what do we do now

20
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.430 
say in case you're wondering
there is no such thing

21
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.260 
as a life editing of source so
that you may have seen that

22
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.320 
in like google docs or in one
drive light that also has this

23
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.260 
web thing you make an added with
multiple people the same time

24
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.300 
that doesn't work for
such conduct heat

25
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
yeah because if i just to lead
us and we call on and then i

26
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.630 
become ram and you can tag compile
your code you will get really

27
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.460 
angry do you really so
probably we all need

28
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.690 
all copy of the source code but
we somehow need to also share

29
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.360 
yeah cosmo as
it turns out

30
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.220 
there what do we also
need we want to track

31
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.620 
the changes so whenever you do
something i want to see ok

32
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.600 
and develop that great feature
i want to praise them

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.320 
and also i go back in time and
see who didn't want in order

34
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.770 
to ask questions or see who
introduced in fact when that person

35
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.120 
or whatever you might meet and
the other thing is that you

36
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.310 
might want to resolve conflicts
so if you guys and the same

37
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.280 
line and degraded here and we did
the same thing in a different

38
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.350 
way yeah which ways in cities
say and of course program is

39
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.560 
love to develop two lane because
they love programming so i

40
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.980 
guess what the dates they introduced
version control as a separate

41
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.370 
tooling and version
control assume that

42
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.660 
four different version
control tools they all

43
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.400 
more or less your work the same
they've got different features

44
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.040 
and we once again
introduce one example

45
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.380 
yeah so let's assume we are
developing the and right out of

46
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.450 
our method p and i can actually
i is open source by the way

47
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.170 
and at the top so you can check
that out so i can make it even

48
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
better yeah say what i want today
is to have a history of i

49
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.100 
will change my an activist
from allows us to

50
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.740 
say you can see this is a graphic
right there is i can basically

51
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.250 
bound means that changes the g
used and that is organised in

52
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.830 
an airway because over
time we have more things

53
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.440 
and we can also go back someone
introduce some question of

54
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.680 
the future or introduced about
we can just go back and say

55
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.140 
ok no let's go somewhere else and
yeah can pinpoint what happened

56
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.550 
in the history yeah and basically
want that's changes as mice

57
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.330 
to court it commits yeah and
we introduce who did this

58
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.420 
for what purposes and when so
basically to commit method should

59
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.580 
be really descriptive so we've
got a the message times them

60
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.260 
and the also to yeah
besides that we actually

61
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.190 
want to maybe have
different copies are

62
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.380 
designed software so maybe you're
working on open a chair i

63
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.700 
am i z organize a p said
yours is more yellow orange

64
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.660 
and minus more building again
i can actually we might need

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.350 
different bases and if i if you
use a feature and he didn't

66
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.550 
change want to match it
may be that together

67
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.920 
and yet that is basically
branching and russia

68
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.320 
yes they they're different features
branches that kind of go

69
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.920 
off from one main branches
like a big line there

70
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.490 
and at some point we might
want to like merge them back

71
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.170 
and the main branch is also
called the master branch

72
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.620 
and if i have the polar or more
less official software and

73
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.770 
you are developing some features
there of course i want to

74
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.280 
make sure that is all well
documented that you use

75
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.220 
good in identifier so that
i have speaking names

76
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.300 
that you did the way
i wanted to be you

77
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.310 
know just joking so
most of you've got a

78
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.520 
certain qualitative standards in
your software so there's also

79
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.600 
the possibility to add like a
gatekeeper and someone has to

80
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.570 
give his sums up or two cousins
need to give of sums up

81
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.550 
in order to be yet the changes
to be accepted into the master

82
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.650 
branch so that is
also more or less

83
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.430 
the tool so to improve the quality
of software so that at least

84
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.940 
three poses have seen
the code yeah and

85
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.690 
when you yeah you basically develop
something i develop something

86
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.380 
we are changing the same line
of code we need some way of

87
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.160 
resolving the conflicts so working
towards have conflict resolution

88
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.100 
and last but not least that comes
is a very important for program

89
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.180 
is that there is actually now one
copy of software on one laptop

90
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.480 
somewhere rather like distributed
over must compute transform

91
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.970 
on nine seven so the next he
multiple people can access so

92
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.300 
when i when i check out which is more
less download the repositories

93
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.110 
all the all the files
of the source code

94
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.820 
then i of course created local
more less back up on my computer

95
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.980 
and everyone who does
it has a complete

96
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.480 
yeah all vulcans also
software and wall at

97
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.910 
a computer scientist to do that
can really see right yeah say

98
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.630 
i pray one liter of water over
my book like fight there is

99
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.740 
prior to that actually
faeces that line

100
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.410 
and really freaking out that i had
a back up in version control

101
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.900 
like it was also support ating
is obviously and i was really

102
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.790 
glad to the data at site
i love version control

103
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.880 
like poor laptop
yeah ved really

104
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.010 
do version control that really
say july sometimes did for me

105
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.320 
and i'll say if you really want
to become a professional suffer

106
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.260 
development is no way around it
and now finally one example

107
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.340 
of a version control system
is get we have chosen

108
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.510 
it because it's free and open
source and it's really quite

109
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.160 
you're a little
bit buyers

110
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.640 
maybe a little bit ab that
gets it you're which was is

111
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.730 
it also he does the defector
standard basically for something

112
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.060 
about and say only very
few people do not use

113
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.670 
it now based on like old software
that has developed for many

114
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.700 
years that is still on the old
systems they also have their

115
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.810 
rights to be there so
there the pros and cons

116
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.650 
so there's also it also as the
and there's a really old cbs

117
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.600 
so there are different
options you can use mercury

118
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.340 
whatever about we're showing
get here almost motor

119
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.250 
control systems can do
the same thing yeah

120
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.600 
get is distributed that means
there's no oneself elemental

121
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.950 
that has all the cans and and
everybody has to after that everyone

122
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.510 
on their machine has a full copy
of for repository means the

123
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.640 
full cool place with all these three
and say i don't have actually

124
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.030 
interconnects i'm working
on trainer something

125
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.720 
i actually is still can
be that and once i have

126
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.300 
internet's back in time as you
can can exam push it changes

127
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.800 
and now we spoke about the
repository repository quite often

128
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.030 
so there's lots of a
cavalry behind that

129
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.610 
and a repository is
more list let's check

130
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.870 
all the fires together and whenever
i change show files i do

131
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.310 
something like commit and that
is basically just my name or

132
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.960 
also scored my also type
because we can write

133
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.980 
anything i want their then
i have a commitment

134
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.100 
such so more less i should really
descriptively say what i

135
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.520 
had done there because
everyone will see that

136
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.290 
and i've got a times
there so just like

137
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.900 
when did i do that and with that
we have a really good book

138
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.230 
on control already
because we know who did

139
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.310 
what when yes they basically
if i gave at six o 'clock

140
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.870 
from the office back in time and
i'm an office back again in

141
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.370 
the morning and i can check
actually what happened throughout

142
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.820 
the night and see who did
what and how can that say

143
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.460 
it is out of many
reasons really helpful

144
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:46.410 
and there's also some more vocabulary
and we're going to cover

145
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.360 
all that in an example

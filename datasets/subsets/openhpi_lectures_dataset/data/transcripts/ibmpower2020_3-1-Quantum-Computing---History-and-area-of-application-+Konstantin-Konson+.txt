00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.240 
Hello and welcome to our sessions
Quantum computing on the road

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.350 
to Quantum History and
area of application.

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.300 
My name is Konstantin Konson
and I would like to give you

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.780 
a kind of introduction
in the Quantum topic.

5
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:26.400 
Some few words about myself: I have a
master in Technical Cymermetic and

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.320 
Computer science and Economy
and I have a white area

7
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.650 
of interests beginning from
cosmology, mathematics, physics and

8
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.210 
even religion and literature. With
other words everything what

9
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.000 
can help us to
understand our world.

10
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.940 
I'm since the 1999
IBM and after

11
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.180 
different things but I have made like
availability and disaster recovery.

12
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.970 
So right now I am a member off Lab
services with Lab consulting

13
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.870 
and I'm very proud to be a member
of IBM Quantum Ambassador team.

14
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.600 
So what is the Quantum?

15
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.340 
A Quantum is just their small elemental
entity in their micro world.

16
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.540 
And quantum theory is the theory
that describes all dear process

17
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.730 
and events and objects
from the micro world.

18
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.440 
On the atomic scale. And now the quantum
computing is the use of quantum

19
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:54.220 
mechanical phenomena such as superposition
and entanglement and interference

20
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.560 
to perform the computation.
Each big things has to

21
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.540 
have a great begin. And as you
can see in the year 1981,

22
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.670 
the physics of computation
conference was placed at MIT.

23
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.510 
There was a big number of
a very rare physicists

24
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.520 
on this conference and and they
have met each other to discuss

25
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.110 
the questions like, how
they can help each other

26
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.270 
from one side by
fundamentals signs

27
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.300 
and from the other side
by computing how they

28
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.220 
work together more productive.
So just to give you some names

29
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.460 
of this audience on the left-hand
side you can see Freeman Dyson,

30
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.290 
the inventor of the idea of Dyson sphere
so this is the hypothetical construct

31
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.620 
that can collect the
energy of our star.

32
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:23.400 
Further Rolf Landauer in the middle.He is the
autor auf so-called Landau- prince -princip.

33
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.890 
Which describes the coupling of
general computation process

34
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.240 
with fundamentals of
thermo dynamics.

35
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.130 
Conrad Zuse who is inventor
of the first digital

36
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.940 
electronic computer
in the year 1938.

37
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.390 
Then on the bottom you can see
Charles Bennett it is not on

38
00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.250 
the picture because he was the photographer,
but Charles Bennett in the meantime

39
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.690 
was a IBM employer and he
became the IBM fellow.

40
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.580 
His invent off different important
things he was a driver of

41
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.770 
Quantum computation at least in scope
of IBM but also outside of that.

42
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
Just mention here he has his works papers
also collaborations with other scientists

43
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
in the area of Quantum
cryptography. And he is inventor

44
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.130 
discoverer of quantum
teleportation.

45
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.900 
So now last but not least a nobel
prize winner Richard Feynman.

46
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.680 
Richard Feynman during this conference
has published his famous paper

47
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.490 
where he stated that our nature and our
world is not classical it is quantum.

48
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.360 
If it would be classical than we
could efficient simulate that

49
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.080 
using our classical computer,
but since it is not classical

50
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.320 
it is quantum mechanical than we need
probably quantum devices, quantum computers

51
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.040 
to efficiently simulate
and learn our world.

52
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.640 
What he means when he
talks about efficiency

53
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.130 
the step into the complexity of
algorithms complexity theory

54
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.520 
very rotate we have a two domains
of algorithms they are polynomial

55
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.940 
and non polynomial or
exponential algorithms.

56
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.480 
And the polynomial algorithms can be managed
by classical devices by classical computers

57
00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.800 
that are algorithms, that
manages tasks that requires

58
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:11.580 
a polynomial in sense of input number of
steps. Or when we see more generally

59
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.540 
the efficient resources and the resources
we understand scipio storage.

60
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:28.690 
time to solve the problem. Ok but a lot
of problems around are non polynomial,

61
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.550 
that means they require an
exponential number of steps before

62
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:44.720 
they can be solved. And as we can see
right now even by supercomputers

63
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.650 
can be efficient managed just
the systems about 30-40

64
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.370 
elements in then interact
to each other.

65
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.340 
So there are some examples
from our daily life

66
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.910 
travelling salesman problem. It is a
very known problem of class of problem

67
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.050 
known as incomplete that means
non polynomial. So that means

68
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:24.850 
this algorithm, this problem requires a
rather quasi exponential number of steps.

69
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.230 
Yet you have for example a number
of cities and you have young

70
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:38.160 
logistical a company and you have
to visit all the cities, probably

71
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.060 
one time and just the usual where
you have to put it you have

72
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:49.570 
to get the well some somewhere and you
have to organise your optimal route.

73
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:56.590 
Now in the independence from different
factors, for example traffic.

74
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.540 
And it hasn't to be done not just one but
it has to be modified to be changed

75
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.670 
to be customized dynamically.
So in principle each minute

76
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:18.110 
or even more often. Ok ow you have
or your cost function has to be

77
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.740 
minimized or probably some function
that has to be optimized.

78
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.170 
So this is the classical optimization
problem and such a problem

79
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.860 
is a very good candidate to be
solved by a quantum computer.

80
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:39.550 
We can also say the quantum computer
are not solve any problem

81
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.740 
there are just classes specific
classes of problems that are

82
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.600 
that a very good candidate that
a predestination to be solved

83
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:56.130 
by quantum computer since they cannot
be solved by a classical computer.

84
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:03.010 
Another example cryptography. As you
know in internet the security of

85
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:09.400 
fundamentals are based on RSA
algorithm and RSA algorithm

86
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:15.420 
itself is based on the simple mathematic
problem. And this problem is

87
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.970 
factorization from the product
of two prime numbers. So

88
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.810 
if you have to prove numbers for
example three and five and you

89
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.750 
multiply that you get a fifteen and
this fifteen you can factorized to

90
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.860 
a two prime numbers. there is only one
way to factorized such a product.

91
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:42.900 
ok as long this numbers are small
for example up two thousand.

92
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.970 
Than we can do that manually, but
if the numbers are big enough

93
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:53.950 
for example the prime
numbers are about 500

94
00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:00.860 
long and the product is then
a 1000 bits long than even

95
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.740 
the supercomputer have no practical
chance to solve this task.

96
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:12.860 
Ok and therefore we say our as
algorithms are absolutely safe

97
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:19.500 
but now in the yard 1993
Peter Shore who was

98
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:26.320 
the ideal employer at this time
has proposed his algorithm.

99
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:33.630 
And this algorithm if it would be running
on the hypothetical quantum computer

100
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:41.460 
would solve, would crack this the
score, this a factorization problem.

101
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:48.210 
Just in our logarithmic time
probably logarithmically

102
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:54.090 
with power to somethin. But still
it would be solved in minutes,

103
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.570 
in scope of mills if now compare
what classical computer

104
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:06.750 
you need for that, are a 1000 of
years and here you have some mills.

105
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:16.000 
So as you see the source algorithm can really solve
this cryptographically problem very efficiently.

106
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:28.030 
But now it is a not really and not actual
in the current time. Why? because

107
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:35.090 
a real implement the short
algorithm will need about 1-3

108
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:42.150 
millions of qubit. Ok right
now we are on 50 plus so

109
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.430 
we still have time but we
have to think about. What

110
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.530 
you see is a
cup of coffee

111
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.750 
coffein this is the molecule
of coffee as you see it is

112
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.980 
not really complex. It is just
a five kinds of elements but

113
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:09.570 
what we can see the number of
nucleotides the nucleotides

114
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:15.610 
means proteins, natrons, electrons
they are interacting to each

115
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:24.350 
other with the orbitals. Then we have
a really complex system from about

116
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.430 
hundreds of elements.

117
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:35.960 
And as you can see he even the
supercomputer are able to manage

118
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:42.980 
at the interacting systems
that have about 30-40

119
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:49.210 
elements. And here on this relatively simple
molecule there are thousand of limits.

120
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.430 
So the supercomputer has
really no chance here.

121
00:12:54.550 --> 00:13:01.060 
But we claim that with
160 logical tube bits

122
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.730 
the quantum computer are able to
solve this task. What means solve?

123
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.400 
It is the modelling of such a molecule
and modelling who also understands

124
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:20.250 
the task grouns energy.

125
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.830 
Ground energy is very important
to understand the properties of

126
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.060 
materials on the atomic
and molecular level.

127
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.800 
If I say 160 logical bits
attributes. I mean that

128
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:44.010 
there are very good qualitative
qubits. That means

129
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.670 
the error rate, the quality, the
error rate of them is very

130
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.460 
high. That means the error rate
is very low, so that means

131
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.970 
we can really efficiently
compute calculate with

132
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:08.400 
such qubits and they keep the quantum
properties during the whole calculation. Look

133
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:15.950 
in this table you can compare the different
materials and different elements.

134
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:23.050 
So you see to model the water
molecule or ethanol are

135
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:28.940 
there are still ok even with a classical
computer because you need some

136
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:35.220 
in the worst case. So billions
of beets but it is a tubal.

137
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.120 
But now as mentioned caffeine,
that we can address with

138
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:46.110 
160 qubit unit the
classical bits about ten

139
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:52.170 
to power 48 and ten to
powe 48 is comparable

140
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:58.830 
with number of atoms on our whole
planets. Some practical impossible.

141
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:04.890 
caffeine is not a omplex molecule
you can see like penicillin

142
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.880 
is more complex and you see that
there is no chance to model

143
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.500 
that using our classical
supercomputer. But if we have a good

144
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:25.300 
enough a quality of qubit than we hope that
we can solve it. Him another example

145
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:32.540 
are in the nature magazine was
published in the year 2017

146
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:40.390 
the simulation of a two simple
molecules one is age two and

147
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:47.700 
age little. And you can see
here on the picture below

148
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.190 
that the results were more
or less acceptable.

149
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:58.060 
By the way here is to mention
that the number of qubits

150
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:04.240 
that we need to address such a
problem is comparable with

151
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:09.850 
degrees of freedom, degrees
of freedom of the

152
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:15.480 
nucleus of a atoms or
problem neutrons protons

153
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:23.530 
So and you can see that in one
year that nature published

154
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:29.960 
the next results of the same
simulation and you can

155
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.950 
see the results are ten times better
than in the previous year. Why?

156
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:42.180 
because a lot of improvements has been
done to the quantum computer itself.

157
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:48.610 
Beginning from hardware, quality
of qubits, qubits typology.

158
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:56.340 
So the placing of qubits on the chip and
how the qubits interact to each other.

159
00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:02.870 
And also in software in transparent
is a compiler for quantum computer.

160
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:08.280 
So in the interests of transparency
he has been some improvements.

161
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.630 
So and all that has resulted
in really in a very good

162
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:21.540 
improvement on the simulation. Now
to make a summary for the problems

163
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.360 
you can see the problems can be
addressed by classical computer

164
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:32.260 
the blue are heart problems
for blue lips for

165
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.860 
heart problems for classical
computers ok we hope to be able

166
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:43.130 
to address that using a quantum
computers and they are cross over

167
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.210 
so that there are some problems
that probably are only possible

168
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.100 
by a quantum computer. Such are
simulation of quantum mechanics.

169
00:17:53.310 --> 00:18:00.190 
So now all the applications,
different domains for applications

170
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:06.760 
like in chemistry and a materials research.
From chemistry to materials research

171
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.190 
it's very important step. So
now optimization any kind

172
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:18.620 
of optimization you can think
about, like banks insurances,

173
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.890 
financial branch and so on and machine
learning, machine learning of course.

174
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:31.880 
There are already some machine learning
quantum algorithms for example form

175
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:38.080 
support vector machine yahoo in
supporting how to calculate

176
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.330 
the kernel support vector machine, also
the quantum algorithm can be applied.

177
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.290 
For about factoring have also
mentioned so even our need

178
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:56.160 
to be a mentioned that the quantum
computer brinks not only the

179
00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.480 
a speech on the calculation but also
there are different kind of thinking.

180
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:09.210 
There are some ideas that are only
possible on the quantum computer.

181
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:14.400 
So and these ideas are integrated
in the quantum algorithms.

182
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:23.140 
So that means are with new ideas we
hope to achieve the quasi exponential

183
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.640 
quite exponential
efficiency.

184
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.400 
On the solving of
such problems.

185
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:43.120 
As you can see a kind of
story history x the whole

186
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.510 
20 century is the a quantum
theories, the beginning from

187
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.230 
quantum mechanics and now
quantum field theory.

188
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.560 
So now Quantum Ready

189
00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:02.200 
that we try to bring the industry to
their, to the status to understanding

190
00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:08.280 
why quantum computers are
important what can be usage

191
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.410 
of quantum computer what can be the
benefit them, So with other words

192
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:19.210 
the industry, the companies
have to be prepared

193
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:25.830 
mental and probably and also
in the concrete problems,

194
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:33.980 
have to be prepared how they
can make a usage of the

195
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.110 
quantum computer.

196
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:45.340 
So a quantum advantage it is a
term that more or less accepted

197
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.320 
in their world of quantum computation.
Quantum advantage means

198
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:57.320 
that quantum computer can
solve they problems

199
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:05.660 
at least as good as the
supercomputer can

200
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.760 
do that or even
better. So even the

201
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.510 
this should be valid for a
some classes of problems.

202
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:21.980 
For example in one class of
problem the quantum computer has

203
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.800 
shown the results at
least so good as a

204
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:33.560 
supercomputer then we can say ok for this
class of problems quantum advantage

205
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:43.290 
is achieved. Ok ike for
classical computer we have a

206
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:50.360 
Von Neumann architecture that
describes what component

207
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:55.450 
for normal for
classical computer,

208
00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.300 
we have also some criteriawhat
is necessary to

209
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:07.720 
build a quantum computer. And
that are just some points.

210
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.610 
Though we have to have the qubit
and the qubits have to be

211
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.460 
scalable so that that the
other means we have to

212
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:25.030 
be able to have more
and more qubit from

213
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:32.700 
the same quality. Now we have to
have a mechanism to initiate their

214
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.420 
state of the cubits,

215
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.790 
then the cubits have to have
appropriate decoherence time

216
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:50.360 
that means they have to keep the
quantum properties in scope off

217
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:57.830 
sometime. And right now this
time is 50-100 microseconds

218
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.630 
ok and in this time

219
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.730 
our quantum program quantum
experiment has to be completed.

220
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:12.720 
It is possible because the time
off of gates of manipulation

221
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:21.870 
is in a area of a tense of nanoseconds
therefore we have a enough time

222
00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:29.770 
to ran the quantum program. Ok
and we have told to have them

223
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:37.740 
a universal set of quantum gates there
are quantum operators, this is the

224
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:43.550 
method of manipulating of our
qubit so then we have to have

225
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:49.390 
a measurement mechanism how
we get out our data. Here

226
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.580 
you can see the first quantum
computer that has been rolled

227
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:59.660 
out from the laboratory to the
clan's center in the yorktown.

228
00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.620 
So this is the real working
commercial quantum computer it

229
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.520 
is called IBM Q System One
and you can see that its is

230
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:20.140 
a nice design, well and all the this
control technique is now covered.

231
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:26.030 
So and that is their view from inside
you can see on their left hand side

232
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.920 
there is there is the chip
or the chip qubit up laced

233
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:35.410 
and then in the mid you can see
the quantum computer itself

234
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:43.060 
and the chip is placed on the
very bottom of this cooler.

235
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:48.800 
And cooler is this refrigerator
and it is necessary to cool

236
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:55.680 
up to 15 mk which is almost
absolutely zero this temperature

237
00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:07.150 
is about 500 times cooler than than our
universe. And under this conditions

238
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.600 
a quantum computer can calculate.
On the right hand side you can

239
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:19.340 
see the control device that send the
microwaves pulses to manipulate

240
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:26.310 
the cubits and to reachout
there informations.

241
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:32.610 
So all that is possible thanks
to the concept of qubit.

242
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.490 
You can see here the comparing
between the classical bit

243
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:43.620 
and qubit. Classical bit can have
only two states zero or one

244
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:50.840 
or just two different states,
doesn't matter what the states are

245
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:57.380 
and the classical bit can be only
in one of the states in the time.

246
00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:04.060 
While the quantum bit it is represented
on so-called blogosphere.

247
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:13.080 
And you can see it is their
whole room hole space between

248
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:18.520 
zero on the north pole and one on
the south pole. And in principle

249
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.910 
each a point on the sphere to
the vector and each vector is

250
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:29.560 
the superposition of the qubit.
That means it is a bit a

251
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.080 
little pits zero and
a little bit one.

252
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:39.540 
Ok and you can see here on the the
presentation of the qubit and that too

253
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.710 
to empower the number of qubits,
for example if you have

254
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:50.710 
one qubit that state we can
express in the form of

255
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.130 
a linear combination
of zero and one.

256
00:26:55.650 --> 00:27:02.300 
A and B are complex factors complex
coefficients and from the

257
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.440 
the physical point of view
they are amplitude of

258
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.820 
the wave function that describes
this quantum object qubit

259
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:16.590 
and since there are amplitudes
if you square the amplitude

260
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.530 
you get the probability. Probability
of the state zero state

261
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:26.760 
one that that means, if you add together
all the probability you get one.

262
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.850 
You can see that also with two,
two cubits you have there

263
00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:38.220 
for possible states with
a,b,c,d complex coefficient.

264
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:48.160 
Eight state's and so on. Now
you have to empower 64.

265
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:54.890 
And it s already big
enough, the number is big

266
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.170 
enough then the question is ok
what is then the difference

267
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:05.900 
between the normal classical
register and quantum qubits.

268
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:13.690 
Because the normal register
can also take all this to

269
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.920 
empower 64 states. The difference
is that the classical

270
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:25.680 
register can take only one state
in time and the quantum computer

271
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.650 
can take all the state simultaneously.
So that means you see

272
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:37.670 
here the quasi
exponential space,

273
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:43.780 
comparing to the classical
computation. So and last but

274
00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.780 
not least just for motivation
if we have about 275

275
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.730 
logical qubits on the
high quality of qubit

276
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:59.180 
we can in principle simulate at
all atoms in our universe.

277
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:08.600 
Ok and finally I want to
repeat the words of

278
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:14.000 
Richard Feymann: Nature is not
classical and if you want to

279
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.970 
make a simulation of nature you
will better make it quantum

280
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:23.230 
mechanical, it is a wonderful
problem because it doesn't look

281
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.530 
so easy. Thank you very
much for your attention.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.879 
Welcome to this new openHPI course, Digital Entrepreneurship.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.225 
My name is Dr. Katharina HÃ¶lzle and I am the professor of the research group IT

3
00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.599 
Entrepreneurship at the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) in Potsdam.

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.819 
My research group focuses on investigating the role of digital technologies

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.289 
and how they drive business models and enable collaboration

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.520 
and outcomes of entrepreneurial operations.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.702 
We consider entrepreneurial activities and innovation as key drivers

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.280 
of economic development.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.799 
Our current research projects revolve around digital transformation, digital

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.090 
ecosystems, digital education and, of course,

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.249 
digital entrepreneurship.

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.070 
Throughout the next weeks, I will be joined by other research group members,

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.748 
Dr. Robert Rosa, Valeska Maul, and Nina Bachmann.

14
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.114 
Together, we will guide you along this learning journey with thought-provoking

15
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.499 
scientific inputs and interesting practical insights from our

16
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.290 
various experts. But before we get more into the course contents,

17
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.089 
I would like to introduce the teaching team.

18
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.270 
Hello, my name is Robert Rose, and I'm a postdoc at the research group

19
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.419 
IT Entrepreneurship.

20
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.899 
I am especially interested in understanding and analysing collaborative

21
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.600 
activities in entrepreneurship with a particular focus on innovation teams.

22
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.220 
In this context, I find it especially interesting to understand how

23
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.357 
virtuality and digital tools affect teams and the collaboration

24
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.870 
over time.

25
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.540 
Hi, my name is Valeska Maul and I'm a research assistant at the research group,

26
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.769 
my research interests concern innovation policy, meaning I'm curious about how

27
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.999 
political incentives within the innovation system can trigger entrepreneurial activities.

28
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.990 
In my research, I don't view entrepreneurship as a single person phenomenon.

29
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.439 
Moreover, many different actors create innovation and entrepreneur activities within

30
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.479 
the innovation system.

31
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.185 
Hey, I am Nina Bachmann, and I am also a research assistant at IT

32
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.270 
entrepreneurship. I have a sustainable outlook on entrepreneurship topics

33
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.668 
through my research focus. I have developed a keen interest in

34
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.921 
sustainable development goals set by the United Nations, more concrete,

35
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.278 
I want to understand how we can apply digital entrepreneurship

36
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.509 
and digital tools to reach these goals and create a sustainable

37
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.510 
impact.

38
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.744 
Throughout the next couple of weeks, we will further touch upon our research

39
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.559 
interest within the online course, we hope to spark your interest

40
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.647 
in new and relevant scientific findings in the field of digital

41
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.889 
entrepreneurship and give you an understanding of the diverse array

42
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.680 
of topics in this field.

43
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.162 
In this initial session and the included input videos, we will focus

44
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.270 
on defining digital entrepreneurship and embedding it in the

45
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.449 
volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world we live

46
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.979 
in today. Further, you will get an idea of what you can expect

47
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.049 
from us and the course and what you can do to successfully complete

48
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.050 
this openHPI course.

49
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.630 
So, let's get started.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.080 
So what kind of prototyping
methods are there and which one

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.030 
should you choose for your idea?
The most important thing is

3
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.490 
that you build a prototype that
your tester can interact

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.520 
with and I will give you
a few examples now.

5
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.980 
If your solution focuses on a
digital interface and you're

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.130 
interested to know if your tester
would use different functions,

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
you should build a paper mockup
that shows the different screens.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.420 
If your solution is a service and
you're for example interested

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.850 
in the customer communication,
you could stage a roleplay

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.250 
and set the scene for your tester
in a way that they can experience

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.370 
this communication part. If your
idea is a product then you

12
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.020 
should prototype the point of
interaction for your tester.

13
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.900 
So for example your idea might
be a coat that warms the neck

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.070 
of the tester and you could
take some heat packs,

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.480 
put them into the coat and
let the user wear it.

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.250 
If your idea is a space
redesign or process,

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
you could take one element of this
and build it in real size so

18
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.860 
that the tester can interact with
it. Or you build a model of the

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.050 
whole space redesign
and the whole process

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.810 
to explain it to your tester. In
any way, you should start with

21
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.030 
a low-fi prototype with few details
because if your prototype

22
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.140 
has too many details it might
actually discourage your tester

23
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.280 
from giving you honest feedback.
We know it might be difficult

24
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.170 
to put something out there
that's unfinished or imperfect

25
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.020 
but also if your prototype has
few details you might feel less

26
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.720 
attached to it and be more open
to discard or change it.

27
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
A simple quick prototype has lower
time and cost effort but you

28
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.390 
can already learn a lot. After several
testing rounds the prototype

29
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.720 
becomes more detailed
and fidelity rises.

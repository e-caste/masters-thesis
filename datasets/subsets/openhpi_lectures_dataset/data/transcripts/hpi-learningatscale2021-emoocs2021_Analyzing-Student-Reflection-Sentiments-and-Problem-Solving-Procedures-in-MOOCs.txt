00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.940 
hi my name is alexander shashkov.
i'm an undergraduate williams college.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.500 
and a researcher at MIT c-cells any scale learning for all group.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.320 
until we talk about our paper analyzing student reflection

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.080 
sentiments and problem solving procedures in MOOCs.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.590 
so the big idea is that we know that student reflection can

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.360 
be useful in traditional classroom settings.

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.530 
we want to scale it up to large MOOCs.
In attritional setting typically.

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.880 
students reflect on what they've learned and

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.430 
instructors will provide feedback

10
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.290 
and read en route reflections to understand how students are feeling.

11
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.060 
in large moves for thousands of students.
this isn't feasible though.

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.830 
our research questions are,
can we accurately extract sentiment from student reflections?

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.120 
so we wanna understand how students are feeling about the course.

14
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.720 
and as soon reflections contain problem-solving procedures.

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.080 
we want to see if we can extract and understand,
if students are using the

16
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.910 
skills that they're supposed to learn in the course.

17
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.700 
our data our survey responses from an introductory programming

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.690 
course run by mit and x

19
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.650 
after completing exercises students respond to two feedback questions.

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720 
the first is ask for asking for any feedback they have in the exercise.

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.610 
and the second is to ask them to outline their problem-solving

22
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.350 
approach and we treat these as reflections.

23
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.300 
we also label five hundred responses to question one as positive

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.640 
negative or neutral to create a training dataset, as well something

25
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.630 
we can validate against.

26
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270 
we pre process responses we start with around thirty six hundred each

27
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.310 
question and after removing unanswered and other responses

28
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.870 
which contain little information.

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.520 
we end up with around nineteen hundred responses.

30
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.570 
analysis we use a combination

31
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.940 
we test both supervised and unsupervised methods.
and we want to automatically

32
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.060 
label responses as positive negative or neutral.

33
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.930 
if another supervised method performs the best and she's around

34
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.330 
eighty seven percent accuracy.

35
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.790 
and here's a heat map of the best performing

36
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.520 
supervised method the diagonal here represents,

37
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.820 
how many responses in each category were correctly labeled.

38
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.650 
for problem solving procedures we first parse responses into

39
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.930 
what we call thought phrases.

40
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.720 
these are pieces of sentences that are meant to represent an

41
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.190 
individual thought and or step in a student's problem-solving process.

42
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.460 
and we use this to do this using a custom sentence parsing technique,

43
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.490 
once we have our thought phrases we group them using topic modeling.

44
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.160 
and from each topic we get the most important
words using the posterior mean.

45
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.040 
from these most important words we are able to empirically

46
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.880 
infer the subject of each topic.

47
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.700 
for instance here are the most important words
from three selected topics.

48
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.240 
in this first topic students appear to be mentioning
by section search which is good,

49
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.040 
because it's the main focus of the exercise.

50
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.470 
in the second one students

51
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.990 
simply talk about utilizing the lecture videos.
and the final one students

52
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.990 
might be talking about using the online discussion forums.

53
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.560 
in this way we are able to understand  which techniques students

54
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.390 
are using and how frequently they are using them

55
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.720 
without having to read through all the responses individually.

56
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.040 
so that's the paper hope you guys enjoy reading it.

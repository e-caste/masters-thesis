00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.840 
In this video,
I'd like to address together with you

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.480 
the question of team composition
and actually how to build a team

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.760 
in a networked organization.
And the first and overall criteria

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.640 
that comes to our mind is actually
building teams around diversity,

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.240 
because bringing people together that have
diverse backgrounds will actually create

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.920 
a higher probability of coming
up with new ideas and concepts.

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.800 
But how can you get there?

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.680 
There are several criteria that you can

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.600 
actually use to create
these diverse teams.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.720 
And the first one is actually the area
of expertise. Within your organization

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.880 
you have people with different

12
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.800 
backgrounds, typically also working
in different areas of your organization aka

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.440 
functions.
So when you're about to develop new

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.320 
business designs or new products
and offerings, it's about bringing people

15
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.200 
together that are already experts
in the fields of operation.

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.280 
So this is the first group
to take into consideration.

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.480 
But then there are also groups of people.
aka

18
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.080 
from marketing and sales,

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.240 
who are very close to the current customers.

20
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.400 
And it also makes sense to integrate
them into that innovation process.

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.040 
Plus, on the other hand,

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.720 
there might be people who seem to be
far distant from the customer,

23
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.720 
these are people in the R&amp;D, "Research

24
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.360 
and Development" department,
and that's also an approach to integrate

25
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
them with their diverse expertise
into that innovation team.

26
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.920 
Besides expertise,

27
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.680 
also take into consideration when it comes
to create and build a team based

28
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.560 
on diversity, that people also display
different roles

29
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.800 
based on the functionalities they're
associated with within the organization.

30
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.960 
People coming from marketing and sales,

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.360 
for example, are used to a completely
different (KPIs) key performance indicators,

32
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.280 
than people were working
in operations or even in R&amp;D.

33
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.040 
So when you bring people together who have
actually different roles within

34
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.520 
the organization, you also have to take
this into consideration for the team

35
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.520 
composition, because then they will also
display certain types and different types

36
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.960 
of behavior within
a specific team setting.

37
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.840 
The third dimension,

38
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.640 
quite often overlooked, is actually
personality. When it comes to teams,

39
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.240 
we can easily work together

40
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.400 
with people we like and also people will
either have a complementary personality

41
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.520 
to us or who are pretty
much the same as we are.

42
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.520 
And for personality,
they are already a couple of approaches

43
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.280 
out there that can be used also
in innovation teams settings.

44
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.800 
They do, of course, we know, have their
advantages, but also their disadvantages.

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.160 
And the two most prominent ones are

46
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.000 
actually the MBTI,
the  Myersâ€“Briggs Team Inventory

47
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.600 
that actually along four different
dimensions,

48
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.520 
distinguishes between 16 personality
types. The most prominent one

49
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.760 
I just want to highlight here, is the one

50
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.880 
that actually distinguishes
between extroverts and introverts.

51
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.000 
Typically in innovation teams, you have an
imbalance of these two personality types.

52
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.640 
Because since innovation is about creating
something new, it's also about seeking

53
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.360 
inspirations from the outside
and being very outspoken.

54
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.200 
So therefore, the power of the introverts

55
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.360 
within these teams is
quite often overlooked.

56
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.480 
So when it then comes actually
to creating these kind of diverse teams,

57
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.720 
also take into consideration to find
a good balance between those different

58
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.480 
styles of personalities,
extroverts on the one hand,

59
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.880 
and introverts on the other hand. Besides
the MBTI, there is another instrument

60
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.000 
I also want to highlight.

61
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.320 
This is actually the Belbin team model.

62
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.480 
Meredith Belbin actually distinguishes

63
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.560 
between nine different types
of teamwork personalities.

64
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.960 
And also here it makes
sense to look at the style

65
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160 
somebody prefers to take over when it
comes to create a team personality.

66
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.440 
For example, being a complete Finisher,

67
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.640 
or an implementer, or a shaper.
Because once you have too much of the same

68
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800 
in an team, that also will prevent
the team from moving forward.

69
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.760 
So to summarize,
it's actually three dimensions you should

70
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.120 
look for when it comes
to compose a diverse team.

71
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.120 
It's expertise, it's roles
and it's also personality.

72
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.800 
And for you, the challenge is to find a
good balance between very diverse teams,

73
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.520 
and some are also unified teams.

74
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.080 
Because too much of the same doesn't move
you forward in terms of creative sparks.

75
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.640 
And too much diversity will create too

76
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.360 
much of the sparks that actually
leads to a disruptive team.

77
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.040 
So therefore, for you, the challenge is
to actually maneuver what you have.

78
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.000 
First of all, what kind of employees do
you have in the organization and how far

79
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.480 
you can stretch the diversity
within you and teamwork.

80
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.560 
Now, I would like to move
on into the setting actually

81
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.320 
of a networked organization, because
it's not just about building one team,

82
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.640 
It's also about how to manage one team
within the organization,

83
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.080 
also how to manage different
teams in that organization.

84
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.080 
And then a couple of key principles

85
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.560 
that we just want to highlight
at this specific point.

86
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.280 
First of all, it's about creating
teams with regard to the team size.

87
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.240 
You can have on the one side,
teams that are too small,

88
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.760 
like, for example, three people and also
teams that are too big, seven plus people.

89
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.680 
And that's actually something we have been
discovering in our research and our Design

90
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.320 
Thinking research program,
together with Stanford University,

91
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.520 
that this actually has an influence
about the creative outcome of teams.

92
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.040 
So two small teams actually tend
to also develop pretty fast

93
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.600 
a group think phenomena, so that they

94
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.400 
agree on a specific aspect
and don't question this any longer.

95
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.320 
And two big teams, large teams
actually tend to fall apart.

96
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.080 
You're going to have different opinions,

97
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.640 
you're going to have different positions,

98
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.040 
and it's quite difficult
to integrate creatively.

99
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.680 
this disruption into a team flow. Besides

100
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.120 
the team size,
it's also about in a networked

101
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.640 
organization to actually set up
a team management structure.

102
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.720 
And that, first of all,

103
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.720 
means how to define the group of people
who are going to be the core team.

104
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.800 
And the core team can be either be people
who are fully dedicated to work

105
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.920 
on the innovation project or who at least can
spend a specifically defined work amount,

106
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.320 
time wise, on being part of that project
group. Besides that core team,

107
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.240 
it's also about integrating that team
in the broader environment.

108
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.360 
And there are two layers that innovation
teams have to be considered in.

109
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.560 
The first layer is actually how to bring

110
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.120 
in expertise from different areas
of the organization into that core team,

111
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.760 
because we don't want to make
that core team too big.

112
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.880 
Therefore, it's about identifying these
experts as extend team

113
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.280 
members and bringing them in from time
to time when it makes sense to actually

114
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.440 
have them there and build on their
expertise within the work.

115
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.760 
Besides having expert as the extend
the team members,

116
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.080 
the second layer is actually about
bringing in decision makers.

117
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.720 
Decision makers in your organization can
be either middle management or senior

118
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.240 
management or even sea level,
depending on where the innovation team is

119
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.680 
actually situated on an
organizational level.

120
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.680 
Bringing them in doesn't mean that they
have to make early decisions

121
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.760 
on the innovation pathway,
but it's about keeping them informed

122
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.240 
and in the loop,
so that they can also follow the process

123
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.240 
as expert advisors
throughout the team work.

124
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.880 
To sum it all up, team.

125
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.800 
Composition is really a crucial part,
not just because of the fact that this is

126
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.520 
the first step into teamwork, but it will
also steer and direct the team process.

127
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.880 
Specifically when it comes to team
communication,

128
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.200 
but also even more specifically when it
comes to the outcomes,

129
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.520 
when you're actually at the end
are aiming for as objectives.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.610 
hi my name is Ethan Prihar.
and i'm going to be talking about

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.730 
our paper towards personalizing
students education with crowdsourced tutoring.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.440 
some background i work at the assistance
lab at worcester polytechnic

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.520 
institute. ASSIST is an online platform that focuses on
k through twelve math education.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
the image here shows what assistance

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.100 
looks like to a student using the
platform after students complete

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.830 
assignments teacher. teachers are
given feedback on their students progress.

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.150 
within the tutor students can
request tutoring when they're

9
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.210 
struggling. for the last few
years teacher assist has enabled

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.420 
us to crowdsource the suturing
from teachers. teacher assist

11
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.020 
is a program that we developed
a few years ago. that is our

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.630 
crowdsourcing platform for
teachers to write tutoring.

13
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.150 
you can see in the image two
different examples of tutoring

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.660 
in the yellow boxes that teachers
have written for the same problem.

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.280 
a student could receive either
of these pieces of tutoring

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.190 
if they were struggling.

17
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.980 
In a previous study published
at learning at scale in 2020

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.880 
we showed that crowdsourcing tutoring
using the teacher's this program was effective.

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.250 
we showed that crowdsource tutoring
made students ask for help less frequently

20
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.830 
in future experiments or
in future problems and

21
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.120 
had fewer attempt counts
on those future problems as well.

22
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.520 
the first thing we did in this study
was to replicate those findings

23
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
using new data from the 2019 2020 school

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.130 
year and the 2020, 2021 school year.

25
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.590 
we showed that not only did
the findings from the previous study hold.

26
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.810 
but we were also able to reliably
show that students had better

27
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.160 
correctness on future problems
requested tutoring less frequently

28
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.630 
and their attempt counts were lower.
all statistically significantly

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.540 
after receiving tutoring from teacher assist.

30
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.860 
so now that we know teacher assist
is overall effective.

31
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.910 
we wanted to take a look  at how
effective teacher assist is for
specific teachers content that they create.

32
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.030 
so to do that we fit a regression
on which teacher will know

33
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.410 
so the regression is predicting
next problem correctness.

34
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.580 
and the regression is uses as input
features of students and problems,

35
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.940 
which hopefully will capture
how much a student's knowledge

36
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.960 
or problems difficulty contributes
to their next problem correctness.

37
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.410 
and an identifier for which teacher
created the tutoring that the student received.

38
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.170 
after fitting the model we can see
that five teachers had a statistically significantly difference

39
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.740 
in the effectiveness of their tutoring
compared to the control

40
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.890 
condition where students didn't
receive any tutoring.

41
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
so of the five teachers four of
the teachers had positive impacts

42
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.150 
and one had a negative impact.
this is a good finding because

43
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.710 
we can now use this information
to prioritize giving content

44
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.730 
from teachers with reliably
positive impacts on learning, and

45
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.900 
to stop giving content from
teachers with reliably negative

46
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.520 
impacts on learning.

47
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.010 
then we wanted to look at whether
we could compare the effectiveness

48
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.640 
of individual content creators
tutoring to each other.

49
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340 
to do this we use the variance
covariance matrix from the previous regression,

50
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.240 
to measure whether each teacher
had a statistically significant

51
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.950 
difference in their tutoring from
each pre like each other teacher

52
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.760 
in the analysis. so this image has a green

53
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:44.460 
cell when the teacher has a statistically
significantly better effect on tutoring

54
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.010 
than the other teacher. so for example
we can see in this graph

55
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.180 
that teacher f is more effective
than teacher's c, g, j, i, and b.

56
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.460 
teacher b is the least effective,
the most teachers are better

57
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.660 
than teacher b, which makes sense
because teacher b had the negative coefficient.

58
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.520 
so this will allow us to compare
two teachers to each other

59
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.910 
in the future, if we're trying
to decide between content to

60
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.710 
give to a student.

61
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.980 
lastly we wanted to see if there
was any evidence of personalisation.

62
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.750 
so personalisation implies that
if we had given one group of

63
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.170 
students one teacher's tutoring
and another group of students another teacher's tutoring

64
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.380 
that both of those groups of
students are going to succeed

65
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.690 
more than if we had given the same
tutoring to both of those groups.

66
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.270 
so to evaluate that we split
our data into high knowledge students,

67
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.660 
and low knowledge students.
high knowledge students have above average

68
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.940 
correctness. low knowledge students
have below average correctness.

69
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.380 
we then did the same comparisons of
each teacher to each other teacher

70
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.520 
for the two groups.
and for personalisation to be effective,

71
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.630 
we would have had to show that in one group

72
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.410 
one teacher was more effective
than another teacher, and in

73
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.830 
the other group that other teacher
was more effective than the first teacher.

74
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.710 
i have highlighted three examples
in red blue and yellow of

75
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.480 
cases where we did not find that.
these are three different

76
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.750 
ways that we can fail.
and the read case

77
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.550 
f is more effective than c for
high knowledge, but c is not

78
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.510 
more effective than f for low knowledge.
so we might as well

79
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.710 
give af to everybody.

80
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
in the blue case k is not more
effective than a and a is not

81
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.790 
more effective than k.
so there's really

82
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.900 
no point. it doesn't really matter
who we choose there.

83
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.160 
and in the yellow option
you can see i is not more effective

84
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.590 
than h for high knowledge,
but h is more effective than i for

85
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.810 
low knowledge. so we might as well
just give h to everybody.

86
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.740 
so there was no evidence that
we can personalize based on students

87
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.640 
knowledge level.
but that's not to say that personalization

88
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.820 
couldn't be achieved with
some other mechanism or even not

89
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.050 
on teachers specifically
maybe you can personalize based on

90
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.420 
the length of the tutoring
or something like that.

91
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.900 
there's more work to be done here,
but the method is

92
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.970 
important and something that
we're going to continue to use

93
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.850 
to evaluate these teachers in the future.

94
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.640 
so in conclusion replicating
last year's study on teacher assist

95
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.530 
found that teacher assist continues
to have an overall positive effect on students.

96
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.530 
tutoring from some content
creators was better than receiving

97
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.330 
no tutoring, while from
other content creators it was worse

98
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.720 
than receiving no tutoring.
some content creators produced tutoring

99
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.530 
that was reliably more effective
than other content creators.

100
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.130 
and when searching for evidence of
opportunities to effectively personalize students' tutoring.

101
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.820 
there was no evidence that
some content creators were better

102
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.330 
than others for high or low knowledge students.

103
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.730 
i'd like to acknowledge a lot of
grants that have helped us

104
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.190 
get to where we are. thank you,

105
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.840 
and thank you for watching
this  presentation.

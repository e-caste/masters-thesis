00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.290 
Hi. In the last video, we have seen that there are barriers to sustainable digitalization.

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.380 
Just because we are humans and we have a tendency to sometimes

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.520 
act in irrational ways, so that the overall CO2 emissions do not decrease

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.390 
to the extent they should.

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.130 
We also found names for these barriers - the rebound effect and

6
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.080 
specifically in the context of software,

7
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960 
the Wirth's law. Now let's talk about what we can do about it.

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.680 
Follow me, we'll have a look into that.

9
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.680 
We go a bit back in history and we start with an equation, the so called

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.480 
Paul Ehrlich equation. It was coinde in nineteen seventy.

11
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.720 
And it computes the ecological impact that we measure in CO2

12
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.180 
equivalence of course.

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.820 
The ecological impact is defined as the product of

14
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.720 
population, affluence and technology.

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.350 
So, the more people we are on the planet

16
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.690 
the more we want and the more technology we have.

17
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.610 
The higher are the CO2 emissions according to this equation

18
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.490 
and the higher is our ecological impact.

19
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
By the way, here technology is

20
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.750 
in the sense that the development of technology causes CO2 emissions.

21
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.630 
So far so good. Later in the 90s, this equation has been updated.

22
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
The new variant of the formula still contains population

23
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.680 
but what follows then is new. Now there is efficiency, consistency and sufficiency.

24
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.650 
How do these three new concepts fit in here?

25
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.500 
We'll have a deeper look next.

26
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.780 
We've already discussed the concept of efficiency and that

27
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.010 
advancements here are often competitive.

28
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.780 
Even though today this is the strategy we follow the most.

29
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.820 
What are its characteristics?

30
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.770 
Well, here we try to optimize the relation of output which is

31
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.640 
some resource we consume, divided by input.

32
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.250 
Thus, a high efficiency means that we would like to have a high output

33
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.430 
and a small input.

34
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.740 
For instance we would like to have a lot of computations of

35
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.610 
CPUs as output while we give only a few electrical energy as input.

36
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.410 
Next, the Paul Ehrlich equation uses consistency

37
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.670 
as a factor that influences the ecological impact.

38
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.380 
Consistency describes the relation between resource consumption and pollution

39
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.380 
of natural environment. In other words it asks

40
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.700 
how much does one unit of consumption

41
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.010 
of things that we consume pollute the environment.

42
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.140 
If the result of that fraction is smaller, the ecological impact

43
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.650 
in the overall equation is small too, of course.

44
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.580 
And the economical model of

45
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.830 
that, that is mostly close to that or the more close to that is

46
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.700 
the circular economy

47
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.160 
in which existing goods and resources are shared and re-used,

48
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.680 
which overall reduces the consumption of new resources.

49
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.230 
Last but not least, we have the sufficiency strategy.

50
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.120 
This one describes the relation between

51
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.130 
capita, which are humans, and goods.

52
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.010 
This fraction basically asks how many goods does a human desire.

53
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.990 
Again the larger the result of this fraction here is the larger

54
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.960 
is the ecological impact of the overall Paul Ehrlich

55
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.990 
equation. So you see that here sufficiency is close to affluence,

56
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.370 
which was part of the first version of the equation.

57
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.200 
So it's kind of still here.

58
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.280 
And which economic model is close to that idea, the idea of

59
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.660 
the growth and post growth economy.

60
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.720 
Now, without understanding of these three strategies, let's discuss

61
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.530 
them in the context of digitalisation and sustainable software engineering.

62
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.920 
For each of these strategies, we'll see solutions now with examples

63
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.960 
that are typically done

64
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.440 
when following a strategy and trying to solve

65
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.660 
to follow it with some practical applications.

66
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.100 
And we also see the barriers that exist against successfully

67
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.490 
implementing solutions for each strategy.

68
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.820 
I think we discussed efficiency already to a fair extent. So

69
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.210 
we can be short here. Basically we would like to increase the output,

70
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.590 
like computing power with a minimum input.

71
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.290 
We already saw that the long term development of CPUs follow exactly that idea.

72
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.230 
Another solution to increase efficiency is,

73
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.130 
just to give another example, is virtualization, which is very much

74
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.490 
used today in data centers.

75
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.210 
One of its advantages are with the input of one server, you offer not only

76
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.130 
one server environment to a customer but several virtual environments

77
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.030 
to one or several customers.

78
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.590 
No rocket science here, but this is well known tech.

79
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.650 
Barriers, well I think you remember that.

80
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.260 
Let's look at the consistency strategy.

81
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.040 
This strategy proposes to reuse things and to share resources.

82
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.610 
It's not limited to software of course. It also refers to re-using

83
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.030 
heat of data centers for consumers outside the data center.

84
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.060 
In the context of software, open source can help.

85
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.130 
Because it can be reused and reassured, so if a new party would

86
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.590 
like to use an existing open source software, that party does not need

87
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.400 
to take the effort, respectively, resources to recreate the software.

88
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.660 
It can just copy it

89
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.710 
and that's it. At least in the easiest case you can easily copy it.

90
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.330 
There can be sometimes more challenges to it.

91
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.030 
Another example we've mentioned already the use of renewable

92
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.190 
energy in data centers.

93
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.700 
Doing so you follow the consistency strategy.

94
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.270 
What are the barriers against reusing software?

95
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.630 
For instance proprietary business models that prohibit to share software easily.

96
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.590 
It makes it harder to just take it and copy it

97
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.100 
and use it for yourself.

98
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.140 
If more companies would follow open source business models

99
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.960 
and use free and open source software and their corresponding licenses,

100
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.740 
the CO2 savings here would probably be higher.

101
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.820 
Last but not least, the sufficiency strategy.

102
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.620 
Basically it asks us to use only what we really need.

103
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.890 
In the context of software for example, we could focus more

104
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.510 
on the really relevant features that are important for the

105
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.040 
stakeholders of our application. And rather avoid nice-to-haves.

106
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.980 
Another example we could operate the software on our server

107
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.690 
with resources that are just enough instead of taking a server with

108
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.450 
much computing power while there's only a simple application to serve.

109
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.990 
We could find many more examples but let's call it enough for now.

110
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.980 
At this point, you'll see that this sufficiency strategy is in some ways

111
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.260 
contrary to the currently predominant efficiency strategy because efficiency

112
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.100 
has no issues against growth,

113
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.160 
while sufficiency strategy does.

114
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.830 
Let's just say, there are many friends of the efficiency strategy out there

115
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.840 
and you can find yourself quickly in a heated discussion about efficiency

116
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.910 
versus sufficiency. In my opinion, we should not see them as

117
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.870 
contrary to each other, and exclusively;

118
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.430 
but more than rather

119
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.330 
that it's good to follow both of them.

120
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.090 
Like the Paul Ehrlich equation asks for.

121
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.810 
Finally I would also like to mention that the consistency and the sufficiency strategy

122
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.050 
have their limits when it comes to apply them in practice.

123
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.600 
Because software projects in reality are often complex and

124
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.280 
sometimes for some reason, you just can't do much about the

125
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.950 
ecological impact in your project.

126
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.910 
However, if more people are aware about these three concepts

127
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.320 
and its practical applications and its barriers,

128
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.360 
the higher the probability that the barriers of all these strategies are understood

129
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.460 
and the potentials of CO2 savings of each strategy are leveraged.

130
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.320 
In the Paul Ehrlich equation this eventually reduces the calculated result

131
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.210 
overall meaning a lower ecological impact.

132
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.410 
In summary, we've seen that the efficiency strategy we mostly follow has

133
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.040 
its limits. Efficiency advancements are often compensated, not

134
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.430 
really reducing our overall resource consumption at the end of the day.

135
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:55.890 
What can we do about it? The Paul Ehrlich equation that calculates the ecological impact introduces

136
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.830 
two additional strategies which have to be considered

137
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.540 
such that the overall result of the equation is minimized.

138
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.210 
These strategies are consistency and sufficiency.

139
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.620 
When we follow all of these three strategies together, then we overcome barriers

140
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.420 
and do software engineering and probably also digitalisation as a whole

141
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.590 
in a more sustainable and ecological way.

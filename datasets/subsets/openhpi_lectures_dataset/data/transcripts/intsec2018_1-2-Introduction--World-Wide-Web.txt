WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.330 
Now let's look at how
the world wide web

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.390 
is working. Along with
e-mail, the world wide web

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.510 
is nowadays the most important
application on the internet.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.950 
The world wide web
you know is the

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.500 
worldwide distributed information
and data collection

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.370 
a huge worldwide
distributed information

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.190 
data collection that can be
accessed over the internet

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.840 
and this access is organized
by the http protocol, by the

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.940 
hyper text transfer protocol. Of
course this protocol is not

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.270 
only responsible to
transmit text document

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.010 
but the protocol is used
to transmit any kind

12
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.520 
of media, any kind of
documents in the world

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920 
wide web. When we look to the
history then the world wide web

14
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.060 
has made the internet very very
popular, has made internet

15
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.640 
the most important
contemporary medium

16
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.750 
and the reason was that it was
so simple to use the web,

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.160 
simply by move and click
and then documents that

18
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.610 
are accessible via the
internet were loaded and

19
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.520 
were shown inside the
world wide web browser.

20
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.540 
Thanks to their
intuitively usable

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.460 
graphical user interface,
the web browsers

22
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.520 
offer for beginners as well
as for professionals, a

23
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.960 
very easy access to this huge world
by distributing information

24
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
and data collection and the
services that are provided

25
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.180 
in the world wide web. If we look
to history of the world wide web

26
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.680 
was introduced by Robert
Cailliau in Tim Berners-Lee

27
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.610 
in the European Centre
for Nuclear Research

28
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.730 
CERN in the early
90s. This is an

29
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.220 
European research centers where
the researchers from national

30
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.600 
countries in this nuclear research
work for a couple of weeks

31
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.080 
or months there and there was a
question how one can access

32
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.930 
from outside from the national
research institutions

33
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.860 
the data of experiments in the
CERN and so Rober Cailliau and

34
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.290 
Tim Berners-Lee provide possibility
developed a technique

35
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.350 
so it's easy to access
data over the internet.

36
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.020 
So the information offered
in the world wide web

37
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.110 
is available as hypermedia
or hyper text documents.

38
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.870 
The hypermedia document are
interconnected to each other

39
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.270 
by so called links from this
mechanisms, this hyper

40
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.070 
it comes from the hypermedia
documents are documents

41
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.780 
that contain links which connect
this document with other

42
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.810 
document and so in this way
the world, the WWW documents

43
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.290 
the web documents form a huge
network of information which can

44
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.200 
be traversed simply by clicking
a click and then going to the

45
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.010 
next document. Along the links
the users can navigate

46
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.500 
with ease through this
information network.

47
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.040 
So we have two documents which are
connected by such a hyperlink.

48
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.670 
So if one is reading
the one document

49
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.880 
you all know this then you hang
and simply click on a link

50
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.190 
to get more information
about that point

51
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.530 
to access another document.
In truth it's not only two

52
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.950 
documents that are connected,
you can connect by means

53
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.690 
of hyperlinks also
documents you can also

54
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.330 
connect to other document
with other media,

55
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.940 
to photo, to video, to sound -
so hypermedia are really

56
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.230 
multi-media. The documents are
distributed worldwide

57
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.400 
and are placed on so
called web servers

58
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.710 
so on the servers the
document are stored.

59
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.260 
Now to access such a document
one needs to identify

60
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.360 
the document and this is
done by means of so called

61
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.240 
URLs uniform resource
locators. These uniform

62
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.270 
resource locators
identify exactly

63
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.230 
the place the server by means of
an internet address and

64
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.930 
in the folder of the
server exactly the place,

65
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.420 
the path where this document is stored
so that if in document is requested

66
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.280 
by means of this URL
this document can

67
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.690 
easily find in the world
wide web and can be sent

68
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.040 
can be responded to the users
that want to access it.

69
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.000 
If we look about the
working principle

70
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.580 
in the world wide web, then this
working principle, this communication

71
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.630 
principle follows the so called
client server principle.

72
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.640 
There is a web client.
This is a browser

73
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.120 
and the browser requests a new
document requested from a web

74
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.040 
server requested via the
URL of that document

75
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.960 
and this request is sent
over the internet

76
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.700 
to the web server. Then the web
server delivers the document

77
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.600 
but it delivers the document only
when the client is authorized

78
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.700 
to access it. So if it
protected resources

79
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:18.510 
before the client has to authenticate that he is authorized
to access this document and the web server can

80
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.570 
deliver the document
only if it's in place.

81
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.560 
So there is a failure message
if the document is not in

82
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.180 
place so that the user
knows the request

83
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.360 
could not to respond
in the right way.

84
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.000 
We have the browser this
is the web client

85
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.400 
and we have the many web servers
distributed over the world wide

86
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.250 
web - over the internet,
over the world wide web

87
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.910 
and from the client from the
user there is a comment

88
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.210 
to request a document
by clicking a link.

89
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.880 
And then in this link mechanism
there is a URL of this document

90
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.770 
included. So the web
server knows exactly which

91
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.450 
document the client is requesting
and then the web server

92
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.630 
delivers this document back
to the client together with

93
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.270 
an appropriate status code.
The document itself

94
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.070 
could be text, could be video - it
could be any kind of media.

95
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.390 
The protocol which sends a
request to the server and sends

96
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.110 
back the answer of the server
this is, I already mentioned it,

97
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:42.210 
the http protocol. This organize
the interaction between browser

98
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.070 
and server and of course it is
not too simple. The internet

99
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:53.010 
is a huge network. So when we
discussed about the internet we saw

100
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.480 
that there are a lot of
intermediate systems,

101
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.490 
so also in this
interaction

102
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.080 
with the http protocol these
intermediate systems play a role.

103
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.530 
Such typically intermediate systems
are proxy server, are also

104
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.300 
called gateways, are caches and
the goal of also intermediate

105
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.860 
systems is to make the
interaction more

106
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.580 
and more efficient to
make it possible

107
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.620 
that the documents are
faster transmitted

108
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.020 
to the user. So with the aid of this
intermediate systems the efficiency

109
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.890 
of the http communication can
be significantly increased.

110
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.580 
So in this course we can not
go too much into the details

111
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.310 
but the different idea to
use a different intermediate

112
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.220 
system is to make communication
more efficient.

113
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.670 
The http communication
can be protected

114
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:55.940 
protected by means of the SSL
the secure socket layer

115
00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.990 
protocols which nowadays
became an internet standard

116
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.440 
and the name of this internet
standard is TLS - the transport

117
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:12.350 
layer security. The idea is to
provide means to encrypted the data

118
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.230 
on their way from

119
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.180 
the client to the server and
back from the server to the

120
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.990 
client and to provide possibilities
to check the sender.

121
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.010 
The SSL/TLS
provides a secure

122
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.800 
really provides a secure
communication infrastructure

123
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.480 
we will see this later if
we go into more detail.

124
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.830 
Let's have a short look on
the most important

125
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.550 
components in this web interaction
this a browser on the

126
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:51.460 
user side and this is server on
the information or service

127
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.690 
provider side. The users of the
world wide web can access

128
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.410 
the huge amount of information
in the world wide web and the

129
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.980 
data that are available

130
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.390 
in the net by means of
their browser. Browsers

131
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.950 
typically provide an easy to
use graphical user interface

132
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.140 
a graphical user interface
which allows to

133
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.070 
point and click to information
and the system understands

134
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:29.700 
the user is requesting these documents
and he did starts http communication

135
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:35.030 
so that the user after a while
can see on his browser

136
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:41.730 
the request document. The browsers
are quite complicated systems,

137
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.310 
they have to understand the user,
have exactly to see if the

138
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:50.170 
user points on a
certain space inside

139
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.000 
the presented document, then the
browser has to compute what

140
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.480 
is the corresponding link in
that place and then he has to

141
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.930 
reveal the information
behind the leak.

142
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.280 
This is beside a link. So this
is most an important URL

143
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.200 
of the document then to
send to start the request

144
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.700 
to the corresponding
server with a request of

145
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.090 
that document and then the server
sends this document back

146
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.890 
the browser has to understand this
document a in a correct way

147
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.970 
has to receive and has to
present it to the user

148
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.510 
in an appropriate way. There are
text parts, there are graphics

149
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.150 
and the browser needs
to understand yes

150
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.470 
this is a video and has to present
the information received

151
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.060 
from the server as a video
or as a photo or others.

152
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.690 
Browsers provide not only the
access to the world wide web

153
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.900 
but also today they are
in integrated media

154
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.120 
also to provide other internet
services for example like e-mail

155
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.720 
or FTP streaming
media or others.

156
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.950 
On the other side the second most
important component is a world wide

157
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:17.730 
web server and compared to the
relatively complicated browser

158
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.240 
software the web server
is quite simple.

159
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.010 
And we can see this is
because the server is

160
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.290 
a program that's waiting for a
connection for a request from a

161
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:37.250 
browser from a client. And as
soon as a client anywhere

162
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.150 
from the world request some
document from the browser from

163
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:47.210 
the server the
server responds to

164
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:52.410 
the browser request. After
sending the reply, the reply

165
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.220 
could be his request document,
the reply could be a failure

166
00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.680 
message, the reply could be
that the browser needs to

167
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.630 
authenticate before you get
access to the document

168
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.270 
after sending the reply
the server terminates

169
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.880 
and waits for a new request.
You see that is a quite simple

170
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.970 
architecture. Nevertheless web
servers today also fulfill

171
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.220 
many other tasks, for example
session management

172
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.940 
also to increase efficiency of
the interaction with the user

173
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.320 
to remember users, to see what
was the last interaction

174
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.880 
and was the content of that
interaction. A server also helps

175
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:43.600 
to start the applications
behind the server, if for

176
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.110 
example a document needs to
be dynamically created

177
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:53.670 
then server starts the
crypts or the dynamic web

178
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.560 
application. So in
this way the server

179
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:05.370 
beside of the browsers are the
two most important components

180
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.970 
which make it possible to use
a web in a way we are used

181
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.020 
to do it. And then do not forget
there are many intermediate

182
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:19.570 
systems which help to increase the
efficiency of that communication.
